The driver will experience torque steer when accelerating because of worn out control-arm bushings.
Rear-wheel-drive vehicles still are affected by torque steer in the sense that any of the above situations will still apply a steering moment to the car (though from the rear wheels instead of the front).
However, the torque-steer effect at the rear wheels will not send any torque response back through the steering column, so the driver will not have to fight the steering wheel.
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper.
It was founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian, before it changed its name in 1959.
Along with its sister papers, The Observer and The Guardian Weekly, The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group, owned by the Scott Trust Limited.
The trust was created in 1936 to "secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference".
The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008, with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators.
Profits are reinvested in its journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders.
It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK.
The editor-in-chief Katharine Viner succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015.
Since 2018, the paper's main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format.
As of July 2021, its print edition had a daily circulation of 105,134.
The newspaper has an online edition, TheGuardian.com, as well as three international websites, Guardian Australia (founded in 2013)
Guardian New Zealand (founded in 2019) and Guardian US (founded in 2011).
The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion, and the term "Guardian reader" is used to imply a stereotype of a person with liberal, left-wing or "politically correct" views.
Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the "Grauniad" in the 1970s, a nickname still occasionally used by the editors for self-mockery.
In an Ipsos MORI research poll in September 2018 designed to interrogate the public's trust of specific titles online, The Guardian scored highest for digital-content news, with 84% of readers agreeing that they "trust what [they] see in it".
A December 2018 report of a poll by the Publishers Audience Measurement Company stated that the paper's print edition was found to be the most trusted in the UK in the period from October 2017 to September 2018.
It was also reported to be the most-read of the UK's "quality newsbrands", including digital editions; other "quality" brands included The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, and the i.
While The Guardian's print circulation is in decline, the report indicated that news from The Guardian, including that reported online, reaches more than 23 million UK adults each month.
Chief among the notable "scoops" obtained by the paper was the 2011 News International phone-hacking scandal—and in particular the hacking of the murdered English teenager Milly Dowler's phone.
The investigation led to the closure of the News of the World, the UK's best-selling Sunday newspaper and one of the highest-circulation newspapers in history.
In June 2013, The Guardian broke news of the secret collection by the Obama administration of Verizon telephone records, and subsequently revealed the existence of the surveillance program PRISM after knowledge of it was leaked to the paper by the whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.
In 2016, The Guardian led an investigation into the Panama Papers, exposing then–Prime Minister David Cameron's links to offshore bank accounts.
It has been named "newspaper of the year" four times at the annual British Press Awards: most recently in 2014, for its reporting on government surveillance.
The Manchester Guardian was founded in Manchester in 1821 by cotton merchant John Edward Taylor with backing from the Little Circle, a group of non-conformist businessmen.
They launched the paper, on 5 May 1821 (by chance the very day of Napoleon's death) after the police closure of the more radical Manchester Observer, a paper that had championed the cause of the Peterloo Massacre protesters.
Taylor had been hostile to the radical reformers, writing: "They have appealed not to the reason but the passions and the suffering of their abused and credulous fellow-countrymen, from whose ill-requited industry they extort for themselves the means of a plentiful and comfortable existence.
They do not toil, neither do they spin, but they live better than those that do."
When the government closed down the Manchester Observer, the mill-owners' champions had the upper hand.
The influential journalist Jeremiah Garnett joined Taylor during the establishment of the paper, and all of the Little Circle wrote articles for the new paper.
The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that it would "zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty ...
warmly advocate the cause of Reform ... endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy and ...
support, without reference to the party from which they emanate, all serviceable measures".
In 1825, the paper merged with the British Volunteer and was known as The Manchester Guardian and British Volunteer until 1828.
In March 2023, an academic review commissioned by the Scott Trust determined that John Edward Taylor and nine of his eleven backers had links to the Atlantic slave trade through their interests in Manchester's textile industry.
The newspaper opposed slavery and supported free trade.
An 1823 leading article on the continuing "cruelty and injustice" to slaves in the West Indies long after the abolition of the slave trade with the Slave Trade Act 1807 wanted fairness to the interests and claims both of the planters and of their oppressed slaves.
It welcomed the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 and accepted the "increased compensation" to the planters as the "guilt of slavery attaches far more to the nation" rather than individuals.
Success of the Act would encourage emancipation in other slave-owning nations to avoid "imminent risk of a violent and bloody termination."
However, the newspaper argued against restricting trade with countries that had not yet abolished slavery.
Complex tensions developed in the United States.
When the abolitionist George Thompson toured, the newspaper said that "[s]lavery is a monstrous evil, but civil war is not a less one; and we would not seek the abolition even of the former through the imminent hazard of the latter".
It suggested that the United States should compensate slave-owners for freeing slaves and called on President Franklin Pierce to resolve the 1856 "civil war", the Sacking of Lawrence due to pro-slavery laws imposed by Congress.
In 1860, The Observer quoted a report that the newly elected president Abraham Lincoln was opposed to abolition of slavery.
On 13 May 1861, shortly after the start of the American Civil War, the Manchester Guardian portrayed the Northern states as primarily imposing a burdensome trade monopoly on the Confederate States, arguing that if the South was freed to have direct trade with Europe, "the day would not be distant when slavery itself would cease".
Therefore, the newspaper asked "Why should the South be prevented from freeing itself from slavery?"
This hopeful view was also held by the Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone.
There was division in Britain over the Civil War, even within political parties.
The Manchester Guardian had also been conflicted.
It had supported other independence movements and felt it should also support the rights of the Confederacy to self-determination.
It criticised Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation for not freeing all American slaves.
On 10 October 1862, it wrote: "It is impossible to cast any reflections upon a man so evidently sincere and well-intentioned as Mr Lincoln but it is also impossible not to feel that it was an evil day both for America and the world, when he was chosen President of the United States".
By then, the Union blockade was causing suffering in British towns.
Some including Liverpool supported the Confederacy as did "current opinion in all classes" in London.
On 31 December 1862, cotton workers held a meeting at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester which resolved "its detestation of negro slavery in America, and of the attempt of the rebellious Southern slave-holders to organise on the great American continent a nation having slavery as its basis".
There was a comment that "an effort had been made in a leading article of the Manchester Guardian to deter the working men from assembling together for such a purpose".
The newspaper reported all this and published their letter to President Lincoln while complaining that "the chief occupation, if not the chief object of the meeting, seems to have been to abuse the Manchester Guardian".
Lincoln replied to the letter thanking the workers for their "sublime Christian heroism" and American ships delivered relief supplies to Britain.
The newspaper reported the shock to the community of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, concluding that "[t]he parting of his family with the dying President is too sad for description", but in what from today's perspective looks an ill-judged editorial wrote that "[o]f his rule we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty", adding: "it is doubtless to be regretted that he had not the opportunity of vindicating his good intentions".
C. P. Scott made the newspaper nationally recognised.
He was editor for 57 years from 1872, and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor's son in 1907.
Under Scott, the paper's moderate editorial line became more radical, supporting William Gladstone when the Liberals split in 1886, and opposing the Second Boer War against popular opinion.
Scott supported the movement for women's suffrage, but was critical of any tactics by the Suffragettes that involved direct action: "The really ludicrous position is that Mr Lloyd George is fighting to enfranchise seven million women and the militants are smashing unoffending people's windows and breaking up benevolent societies' meetings in a desperate effort to prevent him."
Scott thought the Suffragettes' "courage and devotion" was "worthy of a better cause and saner leadership".
It has been argued that Scott's criticism reflected a widespread disdain, at the time, for those women who "transgressed the gender expectations of Edwardian society".
Scott commissioned J. M. Synge and his friend Jack Yeats to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of Ireland; these pieces were published in 1911 in the collection Travels in Wicklow, West Kerry and Connemara.
Scott's friendship with Chaim Weizmann played a role in the Balfour Declaration.
In 1948 The Manchester Guardian was a supporter of the new State of Israel.
Ownership of the paper passed in June 1936 to the Scott Trust (named after the last owner, John Russell Scott, who was the first chairman of the Trust).
This move ensured the paper's independence.
From 1930 to 1967, a special archival copy of all the daily newspapers was preserved in 700 zinc cases.
These were found in 1988 whilst the newspaper's archives were deposited at the University of Manchester's John Rylands University Library, on the Oxford Road campus.
The first case was opened and found to contain the newspapers issued in August 1930 in pristine condition.
The zinc cases had been made each month by the newspaper's plumber and stored for posterity.
The other 699 cases were not opened and were all returned to storage at The Guardian's garage, owing to shortage of space at the library.
Traditionally affiliated with the centrist to centre-left Liberal Party, and with a northern, non-conformist circulation base, the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).
George Orwell wrote in Homage to Catalonia (1938): "Of our larger papers, the Manchester Guardian is the only one that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty".
With the pro-Liberal News Chronicle, the Labour-supporting Daily Herald, the Communist Party's Daily Worker and several Sunday and weekly papers, it supported the Republican government against General Francisco Franco's insurgent nationalists.
The paper's then editor, A. P. Wadsworth, so loathed Labour's left-wing champion Aneurin Bevan, who had made a reference to getting rid of "Tory Vermin" in a speech "and the hate-gospellers of his entourage" that it encouraged readers to vote Conservative in the 1951 general election and remove Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government.
On 24 August 1959, The Manchester Guardian changed its name to The Guardian.
This change reflected the growing prominence of national and international affairs in the newspaper.
In September 1961, The Guardian, which had previously only been published in Manchester, began to be printed in London.
Nesta Roberts was appointed as the newspaper's first news editor there, becoming the first woman to hold such a position on a British national newspaper.
In 1983, the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of cruise missiles in Britain that were leaked to The Guardian by civil servant Sarah Tisdall.
The paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities, which resulted in a six-month prison sentence for Tisdall, though she served only four.
"I still blame myself", said Peter Preston, who was the editor of The Guardian at the time, but he went on to argue that the paper had no choice because it "believed in the rule of law".
In a 2019 article discussing Julian Assange and the protection of sources by journalists, John Pilger criticised the editor of The Guardian for betraying Tisdall by choosing not to go to prison "on a fundamental principle of protecting a source".
In 1994, KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky identified Guardian literary editor Richard Gott as "an agent of influence".
While Gott denied that he received cash, he admitted he had had lunch at the Soviet Embassy and had taken benefits from the KGB on overseas visits.
Gott resigned from his post.
In 1995, both the Granada Television programme World in Action and The Guardian were sued for libel by the then cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken, for their allegation that Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed had paid for Aitken and his wife to stay at the Hôtel Ritz in Paris, which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on Aitken's part.
Aitken publicly stated that he would fight with "the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play".
The court case proceeded, and in 1997 The Guardian produced evidence that Aitken's claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue.
In 1999, Aitken was jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice.
In May 1998, a series of Guardian investigations exposed the wholesale fabrication of a much-garlanded ITV documentary The Connection, produced by Carlton Television.
The documentary purported to film an undiscovered route by which heroin was smuggled into the United Kingdom from Colombia.
An internal inquiry at Carlton found that The Guardian's allegations were in large part correct and the then industry regulator, the ITC, punished Carlton with a record £2 million fine for multiple breaches of the UK's broadcasting codes.
The scandal led to an impassioned debate about the accuracy of documentary production.
Later in June 1998, The Guardian revealed further fabrications in another Carlton documentary from the same director.
In the early 2000s, The Guardian challenged the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Treason Felony Act 1848.
In October 2004, The Guardian published a humorous column by Charlie Brooker in its entertainment guide, the final sentence of which was viewed by some as a call for violence against U.S. President George W. Bush; after a controversy, Brooker and the paper issued an apology, saying the "closing comments were intended as an ironic joke, not as a call to action".
Following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, The Guardian published an article on its comment pages by Dilpazier Aslam, a 27-year-old British Muslim and journalism trainee from Yorkshire.
Aslam was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamist group, and had published a number of articles on their website.
According to the newspaper, it did not know that Aslam was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir when he applied to become a trainee, though several staff members were informed of this once he started at the paper.
The Home Office said that the group's "ultimate aim is the establishment of an Islamic state (Caliphate), according to Hizb ut-Tahrir via non-violent means".
The Guardian asked Aslam to resign his membership of the group and, when he did not do so, terminated his employment.
In early 2009, The Guardian started a tax investigation into a number of major UK companies, including publishing a database of the tax paid by the FTSE 100 companies.
Internal documents relating to Barclays Bank's tax avoidance were removed from The Guardian website after Barclays obtained a gagging order.
The newspaper played a pivotal role in exposing the depth of the News of the World phone hacking affair.
The Economist's Intelligent Life magazine opined that: As Watergate is to the Washington Post, and thalidomide to the Sunday Times, so phone-hacking will surely be to The Guardian: a defining moment in its history.
In recent decades, The Guardian has been accused of biased criticism of Israeli government policy and of bias against the Palestinians.
In December 2003, columnist Julie Burchill cited "striking bias against the state of Israel" as one of the reasons she left the paper for The Times.
Responding to these accusations, a Guardian editorial in 2002 condemned antisemitism and defended the paper's right to criticise the policies and actions of the Israeli government, arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently anti-Jewish are mistaken.
Harriet Sherwood, then The Guardian's foreign editor, later its Jerusalem correspondent, has also denied that The Guardian has an anti-Israel bias, saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
On 6 November 2011, Chris Elliott, The Guardian's readers' editor, wrote that "Guardian reporters, writers and editors must be more vigilant about the language they use when writing about Jews or Israel", citing recent cases where The Guardian received complaints regarding language chosen to describe Jews or Israel.
Elliott noted that, over nine months, he upheld complaints regarding language in certain articles that were seen as anti-Semitic, revising the language and footnoting this change.
On 11 August 2014 the print edition of The Guardian published a pro-Israeli advocacy advert during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict featuring Elie Wiesel, headed by the words "Jews rejected child sacrifice 3,500 years ago.
Now it's Hamas' turn."
The Times had decided against running the ad, although it had already appeared in major American newspapers.
One week later, Chris Elliott expressed the opinion that the newspaper should have rejected the language used in the advert and should have negotiated with the advertiser on this matter.
In October 2023, The Guardian stated it would not renew the contract of cartoonist Steve Bell after he submitted a cartoon featuring Netanyahu, with his shirt open, wearing boxing gloves and holding a scalpel over a dotted shape of the Gaza Strip on his stomach.
The caption read: "Residents of Gaza, get out now."
Due to what has been seen by some as a reference to Shakespeare's Shylock's "pound of flesh", it prompted accusations that it was antisemitic.
Bell said that he was inspired by the 1960s "Johnson's Scar" cartoon by David Levine of U.S. president Lyndon B Johnson within the context of the Vietnam War.
In August 2004, for the US presidential election, the daily G2 supplement launched an experimental letter-writing campaign in Clark County, Ohio, an average-sized county in a swing state.
Editor Ian Katz bought a voter list from the county for $25 and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election, giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of voting against President George W. Bush.
Katz admitted later that he did not believe Democrats who warned that the campaign would benefit Bush and not opponent John Kerry.
The newspaper scrapped "Operation Clark County" on 21 October 2004 after first publishing a column of responses—nearly all of them outraged—to the campaign under the headline "Dear Limey assholes".
Some commentators suggested that the public's dislike of the campaign contributed to Bush's victory in Clark County.
In 2007, the paper launched Guardian America, an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the United States, which at the time stood at more than 5.9 million.
The company hired former American Prospect editor, New York magazine columnist and New York Review of Books writer Michael Tomasky to head the project and hire a staff of American reporters and web editors.
The site featured news from The Guardian that was relevant to an American audience: coverage of US news and the Middle East, for example.
Tomasky stepped down from his position as editor of Guardian America in February 2009, ceding editing and planning duties to other US and London staff.
He retained his position as a columnist and blogger, taking the title editor-at-large.
In October 2009, the company abandoned the Guardian America homepage, instead directing users to a US news index page on the main Guardian website.
The following month, the company laid off six American employees, including a reporter, a multimedia producer and four web editors.
The move came as Guardian News and Media opted to reconsider its US strategy amid a huge effort to cut costs across the company.
In subsequent years, however, The Guardian has hired various commentators on US affairs including Ana Marie Cox, Michael Wolff, Naomi Wolf, Glenn Greenwald and George W. Bush's former speechwriter Josh Treviño.
Treviño's first blog post was an apology for a controversial tweet posted in June 2011 over the second Gaza flotilla, the controversy which had been revived by the appointment.
Guardian US launched in September 2011, led by editor-in-chief Janine Gibson, which replaced the previous Guardian America service.
After a period during which Katharine Viner served as the US editor-in-chief before taking charge of Guardian News and Media as a whole, Viner's former deputy, Lee Glendinning, was appointed to succeed her as head of the American operation at the beginning of June 2015.
In October 2009, The Guardian reported that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter – a question recorded in a Commons order paper, to be answered by a minister later that week.
The newspaper noted that it was being "forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented—for the first time in memory—from reporting parliament.
Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret.
The only fact The Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter-Ruck."
The paper further claimed that this case appears "to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1689 Bill of Rights".
The only parliamentary question mentioning Carter-Ruck in the relevant period was by Paul Farrelly MP, in reference to legal action by Barclays and Trafigura.
The part of the question referencing Carter-Ruck relates to the latter company's September 2009 gagging order on the publication of a 2006 internal report into the 2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump scandal, which involved a class action case that the company only settled in September 2009 after The Guardian published some of the commodity trader's internal emails.
The reporting injunction was lifted the next day, as Carter-Ruck withdrew it before The Guardian could challenge it in the High Court.
Alan Rusbridger attributed the rapid back-down by Carter-Ruck to postings on Twitter, as did a BBC News Online article.
In June 2013, the newspaper broke news of the secret collection of Verizon telephone records held by Barack Obama's administration and subsequently revealed the existence of the PRISM surveillance program after it was leaked to the paper by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The Guardian said a DSMA-Notice had been sent to editors and journalists on 7 June after the first Guardian story about the Snowden documents.
It said the DSMA-Notice was being used as an "attempt to censor coverage of surveillance tactics employed by intelligence agencies in the UK and US".
The newspaper was subsequently contacted by the British government's Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, under instruction from Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who ordered that the hard drives containing the information be destroyed.
The Guardian's offices were then visited in July by agents from the UK's GCHQ, who supervised the destruction of the hard drives containing information acquired from Snowden.
The Guardian said it had destroyed the hard drives to avoid threatened legal action by the UK government that could have stopped it from reporting on US and British government surveillance contained in the documents.
In June 2014, The Register reported that the information the government sought to suppress by destroying the hard drives related to the location of a "beyond top secret" internet monitoring base in Seeb, Oman, and the close involvement of BT and Cable & Wireless in intercepting internet communications.
Julian Assange criticised the newspaper for not publishing the entirety of the content when it had the chance.
Rusbridger had initially covered the Snowden documents without the government's supervision, but subsequently sought it, and established an ongoing relationship with the Defence Ministry.
The Guardian coverage of Snowden later continued because the information had already been copied outside the United Kingdom, earning the company's US website, The Guardian US, an American Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2014.
Rusbridger and subsequent chief editors would sit on the government's DSMA-notice board.
The Guardian published the US diplomatic cables files and the Guantanamo Bay files in collaboration with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.
When some of the diplomatic cables were made available online in unredacted form, WikiLeaks blamed Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding for publishing the encryption key to the files in their book WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy.
The Guardian blamed Assange for the release of the unredacted cables.
Journalist Glenn Greenwald, a former contributor to The Guardian, accused The Guardian of publishing false claims about Assange in a report about an interview Assange gave to Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
The Guardian article had claimed that Assange had praised Donald Trump and criticised Hillary Clinton and also alleged that Assange had "long had a close relationship with the Putin regime".
Greenwald wrote: "This article is about how those [Guardian's] false claims—fabrications, really—were spread all over the internet by journalists, causing hundreds of thousands of people (if not millions) to consume false news".
The Guardian later amended its article about Assange to remove the claim about his connection to the Russian government.
While Assange was in the Ecuadorian embassy, The Guardian published a number of articles pushing the narrative that there was a link between Assange and the Russian government.
In a November 2018 Guardian article, Luke Harding and Dan Collyns cited anonymous sources which stated that Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret meetings with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2013, 2015, and 2016.
The name of a third author, Fernando Villavicencio, was removed from the online version of the story soon after publication.
The title of the story was originally 'Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy'.
A few hours after publication, 'sources say' was added to the title, and the meeting became an 'apparent meeting'.
One reporter characterised the story, "If it's right, it might be the biggest get this year.
If it's wrong, it might be the biggest gaffe."
Manafort and Assange both said they had never met, with the latter threatening legal action against The Guardian.
Ecuador's London consul Fidel Narváez, who had worked at Ecuador's embassy in London from 2010 to July 2018, said that Manafort had not visited Assange.
Serge Halimi said Harding had a personal grievance against Assange and noted that Manafort's name does not appear in the Ecuadorian embassy's visitors' book and there were no pictures of Manafort entering or leaving "one of the most surveilled and filmed buildings on the planet".
The Guardian has neither retracted nor apologised for the story about the meeting.
Stella Moris, Assange's wife, said The Guardian failed in its responsibility to Assange and its "negligence has created such a problem that if Julian dies or is extradited, that will forever blot the reputation of the Guardian".
The Guardian was accused of being "racist and misogynistic" after it published a cartoon depicting Home Secretary, Priti Patel as a cow with a ring in its nose in an alleged reference to her Hindu faith, since cows are considered sacred in Hinduism.
After publishing a story on 13 January 2017 claiming that WhatsApp had a "backdoor [that] allows snooping on messages", more than 70 professional cryptographers signed on to an open letter calling for The Guardian to retract the article.
On 13 June 2017, readers' editor Paul Chadwick released an article detailing the flawed reporting in the original January article, which was amended to remove references to a backdoor.
In January 2021, The Guardian began publishing in the Spanish language under the La Lista newspaper.
In October 2022, Suella Braverman speaking in Parliament blamed "Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati" for disruptive Just Stop Oil protests.
In December 2022 it was reported that The Guardian had suffered a significant cyber-attack on its office systems, thought to be ransomware.
Staff were directed to work from home and were able to continue publishing to the website despite the loss of some internal systems.
The print edition also continued to be produced.
On 4 January 2023, UK staff were informed of a security breach and that the Information Commissioner's Office had been notified, as required by GDPR.
It was indicated that staff would continue working from home until at least 23 January.
The newspaper confirmed on 11 January that personal details of all UK staff had been accessed by criminals.
In November 2023, the Guardian joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Paper Trail Media and 69 media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and more than 270 journalists in 55 countries and territories to produce the 'Cyprus Confidential' report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin, mostly with connections to Cyprus, and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high-up figures in the Kremlin, some of whom have been sanctioned.
Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation's findings in less than 24 hours, calling for reforms and launching probes.
The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group (GMG) of newspapers, radio stations and print media.
GMG components include The Observer, The Guardian Weekly and TheGuardian.com.
All were owned by The Scott Trust, a charitable foundation existing between 1936 and 2008, which aimed to ensure the paper's editorial independence in perpetuity, maintaining its financial health to ensure it did not become vulnerable to takeovers by commercial media groups.
At the beginning of October 2008, the Scott Trust's assets were transferred to a new limited company, The Scott Trust Limited, with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up.
Dame Liz Forgan, chair of the Scott Trust, reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained the same as under the previous arrangements.
The Guardian is the only British national daily to conduct (since 2003) an annual social, ethical and environmental audit in which it examines, under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor, its own behaviour as a company.
It is also the only British national daily newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman (called the "readers' editor") to handle complaints and corrections.
The Guardian and its parent groups participate in Project Syndicate and intervened in 1995 to save the Mail & Guardian in South Africa; GMG sold the majority of its shares of the Mail & Guardian in 2002.
The Guardian was consistently loss-making until 2019.
The National Newspaper division of GMG, which also includes The Observer, reported operating losses of £49.9 million in 2006, up from £18.6 million in 2005.
The paper was therefore heavily dependent on cross-subsidisation from profitable companies within the group.
The continual losses made by the National Newspaper division of the Guardian Media Group caused it to dispose of its Regional Media division by selling titles to competitor Trinity Mirror in March 2010.
This included the flagship Manchester Evening News, and severed the historic link between that paper and The Guardian.
The sale was in order to safeguard the future of The Guardian newspaper as is the intended purpose of the Scott Trust.
In June 2011 Guardian News and Media revealed increased annual losses of £33 million and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage, leaving the print edition to contain more comments and features.
It was also speculated that The Guardian might become the first British national daily paper to be fully online.
For the three years up to June 2012, the paper lost £100,000 a day, which prompted Intelligent Life to question whether The Guardian could survive.
The Guardian Media Group's 2018 annual report (year ending 1 April 2018) indicated some significant changes occurring.
Its digital (online) editions accounted for over 50% of group revenues by that time; the loss from news and media operations was £18.6 million, 52% lower than during the prior year (2017: £38.9 million).
The Group had cut costs by £19.1 million, partly by switching its print edition to the tabloid format.
The Guardian Media Group's owner, the Scott Trust Endowment Fund, reported that its value at the time was £1.01 billion (2017: £1.03 billion).
In the following financial report (for the year 2018–2019), the group reported a profit (EBITDA) of £0.8 million before exceptional items, thus breaking even in 2019.
To be sustainable, the annual subsidy must fall within the £25 million of interest returned on the investments from the Scott Trust Endowment Fund.
In 2014, The Guardian launched a membership scheme.
The scheme aims to reduce the financial losses incurred by The Guardian without introducing a paywall, thus maintaining open access to the website.
Website readers can pay a monthly subscription, with three tiers available.
As of 2018 this approach was considered successful, having brought more than 1 million subscriptions or donations, with the paper hoping to break even by April 2019.
In 2016, the company established a U.S.-based philanthropic arm to raise money from individuals and organizations including think tanks and corporate foundations.
The grants are focused by the donors on particular issues.
By the following year, the organization had raised $1 million from the likes of Pierre Omidyar's Humanity United, the Skoll Foundation, and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation to finance reporting on topics including modern-day slavery and climate change.
The Guardian has stated that it has secured $6 million "in multi-year funding commitments" thus far.
The new project developed from funding relationships which the paper already had with the Ford, Rockefeller, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Gates had given the organization $5 million for its Global Development webpage.
Founded by textile traders and merchants, in its early years The Guardian had a reputation as "an organ of the middle class", or in the words of C. P. Scott's son Ted, "a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last".
Associated at first with the Little Circle and hence with classical liberalism as expressed by the Whigs and later by the Liberal Party, its political orientation underwent a decisive change after World War II, leading to a gradual alignment with Labour and the political left in general.
The Scott Trust describes one of its "core purposes" to be "to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity: as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to its liberal tradition".
The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion: a MORI poll taken between April and June 2000 showed that 80 per cent of Guardian readers were Labour Party voters; according to another MORI poll taken in 2005, 48 per cent of Guardian readers were Labour voters and 34 per cent Liberal Democrat voters.
The term "Guardian reader" can be used to imply a stereotype of liberal, left-wing or "politically correct" views.
Although the paper is often considered to be "linked inextricably" to the Labour Party, three of The Guardian's four leader writers joined the more centrist Social Democratic Party on its foundation in 1981.
The paper was enthusiastic in its support for Tony Blair in his successful bid to lead the Labour Party, and to be elected Prime Minister.
On 19 January 2003, two months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an Observer Editorial said: "Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers.
But if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option. ...
War with Iraq may yet not come, but, conscious of the potentially terrifying responsibility resting with the British Government, we find ourselves supporting the current commitment to a possible use of force."
The Guardian, however, opposed the war, along with the Daily Mirror and The Independent.
Then Guardian features editor Ian Katz asserted in 2004 that "it is no secret we are a centre-left newspaper".
In 2008, Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley said that editorial contributors were a mix of "right-of-centre libertarians, greens, Blairites, Brownites, Labourite but less enthusiastic Brownites, etc," and that the newspaper was "clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive".
She also said that "you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election, The Guardian's stance will not be dictated by the editor, still less any foreign proprietor (it helps that there isn't one) but will be the result of vigorous debate within the paper".
The paper's comment and opinion pages, though often written by centre-left contributors such as Polly Toynbee, have allowed some space for right-of-centre voices such as Sir Max Hastings and Michael Gove.
Since an editorial in 2000, The Guardian has favoured abolition of the British monarchy.
"I write for the Guardian," said Max Hastings in 2005, "because it is read by the new establishment," reflecting the paper's then-growing influence.
In the run-up to the 2010 general election, following a meeting of the editorial staff, the paper declared its support for the Liberal Democrats, due in particular, to the party's stance on electoral reform.
The paper suggested tactical voting to prevent a Conservative victory, given Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system.
At the 2015 election, the paper switched its support to the Labour Party.
The paper argued that Britain needed a new direction and Labour "speaks with more urgency than its rivals on social justice, standing up to predatory capitalism, on investment for growth, on reforming and strengthening the public realm, Britain's place in Europe and international development".
In a 2013 interview for NPR, The Guardian's Latin America correspondent Rory Carroll stated that many editors at The Guardian believed and continue to believe that they should support Hugo Chávez "because he was a standard-bearer for the left".
In the 2015 United Kingdom general election, it endorsed the Labour Party.
In the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, The Guardian supported Blairite candidate Yvette Cooper and was critical of left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, the successful candidate.
These positions were criticised by the Morning Star, which accused The Guardian of being conservative.
Although the majority of Guardian columnists were against Corbyn winning, Owen Jones, Seumas Milne, and George Monbiot wrote supportive articles about him.
Despite the critical position of the paper in general, The Guardian endorsed the Labour Party while Corbyn was its leader in the 2017 and 2019 general elections — although in both cases they endorsed a vote for opposition parties other than Labour, such as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party in seats where Labour did not stand a chance.
In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, The Guardian endorsed remaining in the EU, and in the 2019 European election invited its readers to vote for pro-EU candidates, without endorsing specific parties.
The Guardian had a certified average daily circulation of 204,222 copies in December 2012 — a drop of 11.25 per cent in January 2012 — as compared to sales of 547,465 for The Daily Telegraph, 396,041 for The Times, and 78,082 for The Independent.
In March 2013, its average daily circulation had fallen to 193,586, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
Circulation has continued to decline and stood at 161,091 in December 2016, a decline of 2.98 per cent year-on-year.
In July 2021, the circulation was 105,134; later that year, the publishers stopped making circulation data public.
The first edition was published on 5 May 1821, at which time The Guardian was a weekly, published on Saturdays and costing 7d; the stamp duty on newspapers (4d per sheet) forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently.
When the stamp duty was cut in 1836, The Guardian added a Wednesday edition and with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d.
Following the closure of the Anglican Church Newspaper, The Guardian, in 1951, the paper dropped "Manchester" from its title in 1959, becoming simply The Guardian.
In 1964 it moved to London, losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the more downmarket but more profitable Manchester Evening News.
The financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s; at one time it was in merger talks with The Times.
The paper consolidated its centre-left stance during the 1970s and 1980s.
On 12 February 1988, The Guardian had a significant redesign; as well as improving the quality of its printers' ink, it also changed its masthead to a juxtaposition of an italic Garamond "The", with a bold Helvetica "Guardian", that remained in use until the 2005 redesign.
In 1992, The Guardian relaunched its features section as G2, a tabloid-format supplement.
This innovation was widely copied by the other "quality" broadsheets and ultimately led to the rise of "compact" papers and The Guardian's move to the Berliner format.
In 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet price war started by Rupert Murdoch's The Times.
In June 1993, The Guardian bought The Observer from Lonrho, thus gaining a serious Sunday sister newspaper with similar political views.
Its international weekly edition is now titled The Guardian Weekly, though it retained the title Manchester Guardian Weekly for some years after the home edition had moved to London.
It includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat left-of-centre inclination, including Le Monde and The Washington Post.
The Guardian Weekly was also linked to a website for expatriates, Guardian Abroad, which was launched in 2007 but had been taken offline by 2012.
The Guardian is printed in full colour, and was the first newspaper in the UK to use the Berliner format for its main section, while producing sections and supplements in a range of page sizes including tabloid, approximately A4, and pocket-size (approximately A5).
In 2004, The Guardian announced plans to change to a Berliner or "midi" format, similar to that used by Die Tageszeitung in Germany, Le Monde in France and many other European papers.
At 470×315 mm, this is slightly larger than a traditional tabloid.
Planned for the autumn of 2005, this change followed moves by The Independent and The Times to start publishing in tabloid (or compact) format.
On Thursday, 1 September 2005, The Guardian announced that it would launch the new format on Monday 12 September 2005.
Sister Sunday newspaper The Observer also changed to this new format on 8 January 2006.
The format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the paper's look.
On Friday, 9 September 2005, the newspaper unveiled its newly designed front page, which débuted on Monday 12 September 2005.
Designed by Mark Porter, the new look includes a new masthead for the newspaper, its first since 1988.
A typeface family designed by Paul Barnes and Christian Schwartz was created for the new design.
With just over 200 fonts, it was described as "one of the most ambitious custom type programs ever commissioned by a newspaper".
Among the fonts is Guardian Egyptian, a slab serif that is used in various weights for both text and headlines, and is central to the redesign.
The switch cost Guardian Newspapers £80 million and involved setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester.
This switch was necessary because, before The Guardian's move, no printing presses in Britain could produce newspapers in the Berliner format.
There were additional complications, as one of the paper's presses was part-owned by Telegraph Newspapers and Express Newspapers, contracted to use the plant until 2009.
Another press was shared with the Guardian Media Group's north-western tabloid local papers, which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format.
The new format was generally well received by Guardian readers, who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes.
The only controversy was over the dropping of the Doonesbury cartoon strip.
The paper reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss; within 24 hours the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week.
G2 supplement editor Ian Katz, who was responsible for dropping it, apologised in the editors' blog saying, "I'm sorry, once again, that I made you—and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments' address—so cross."
However, some readers were dissatisfied as the earlier deadline needed for the all-colour sports section meant coverage of late-finishing evening football matches became less satisfactory in the editions supplied to some parts of the country.
The investment was rewarded with a circulation rise.
In December 2005, the average daily sale stood at 380,693, nearly 6 per cent higher than the figure for December 2004.
However, by December 2012, circulation had dropped to 204,222.
In 2006, the US-based Society for News Design chose The Guardian and Polish daily Rzeczpospolita as the world's best-designed newspapers—from among 389 entries from 44 countries.
In June 2017, Guardian Media Group (GMG) announced that The Guardian and The Observer would relaunch in tabloid format from early 2018.
The Guardian confirmed the launch date for the new format to be 15 January 2018.
GMG also signed a contract with Trinity Mirror – the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, and Sunday People – to outsource printing of The Guardian and The Observer.
The format change was intended to help cut costs as it allowed the paper to be printed by a wider array of presses, and outsourcing the printing to presses owned by Trinity Mirror was expected to save millions of pounds annually.
The move was part of a three-year plan that included cutting 300 jobs in an attempt to reduce losses and break even by 2019.
The paper and ink are the same as previously and the font size is fractionally larger.
An assessment of the response from readers in late April 2018 indicated that the new format had led to an increased number of subscriptions.
The editors were working on changing aspects that had caused complaints from readers.
In July 2018, the masthead of the new tabloid format was adjusted to a dark blue.
The Guardian and its Sunday sibling The Observer publish all their news online, with free access both to current news and an archive of three million stories.
A third of the site's hits are for items over a month old.
As of May 2013, it was the most popular UK newspaper website with 8.2 million unique visitors per month, just ahead of Mail Online with 7.6 million unique monthly visitors.
In April 2011, MediaWeek reported that The Guardian was the fifth most popular newspaper site in the world.
Journalists use an analytics tool called Ophan, built entirely in-house, to measure website data around stories and audience.
However, the number of online readers had drastically dropped by July 2021.
The Guardian launched an iOS mobile application for its content in 2009.
An Android app followed in 2011.
In 2018, the newspaper announced its apps and mobile website would be redesigned to coincide with its relaunch as a tabloid.
The Comment is Free section features columns by the paper's journalists and regular commentators, as well as articles from guest writers, including readers' comments and responses below.
The section includes all the opinion pieces published in the paper itself, as well as many others that only appear online.
Censorship is exercised by Moderators who can ban posts – with no right of appeal – by those who they feel have overstepped the mark.
The Guardian has taken what they call a very "open" stance in delivering news, and have launched an open platform for their content.
This allows external developers to easily use Guardian content in external applications, and even to feed third-party content back into the Guardian network.
The Guardian also had a number of talkboards that were noted for their mix of political discussion and whimsy until they were closed on Friday, 25 February 2011 after they had settled a libel action brought after months of harassment of a conservative party activist.
They were spoofed in The Guardian's own regular humorous Chatroom column in G2.
The spoof column purported to be excerpts from a chatroom on permachat.co.uk, a real URL that pointed to The Guardian's talkboards.
In August 2013, a webshow titled Thinkfluencer was launched by Guardian Multimedia in association with Arte.
In 2004 the paper also launched a dating website, Guardian Soulmates.
On 1 July 2020, Guardian Soulmates was closed down with the explanation: "It hasn't been an easy decision to make, but the online dating world is a very different place to when we first launched online in July 2004.
There are so many dating apps now, so many ways to meet people, which are often free and very quick."
An American version of the website titled Guardian America was an American version of the British news website Guardian Unlimited intended to win more U.S.-based readers.
It was abandoned in October 2009.
The Guardian launched an .onion version of its website on the Tor network in May 2022, with assistance from Alec Muffett.
The paper entered podcasting in 2005 with a twelve-part weekly podcast series by Ricky Gervais.
In January 2006, Gervais' show topped the iTunes podcast chart having been downloaded by two million listeners worldwide, and was scheduled to be listed in the 2007 Guinness Book of Records as the most downloaded podcast.
The Guardian now offers several regular podcasts made by its journalists.
One of the most prominent is Today in Focus, a daily news podcast hosted by Anushka Asthana and launched on 1 November 2018.
It was an immediate success and became one of the UK's most-downloaded podcasts.
In 2003 The Guardian started the film production company GuardianFilms, headed by journalist Maggie O'Kane.
Much of the company's output is documentary made for television– and it has included Salam Pax's Baghdad Blogger for BBC Two's daily flagship Newsnight, some of which have been shown in compilations by CNN International, Sex on the Streets and Spiked, both made for the UK's Channel 4 television.
GuardianFilms has received several broadcasting awards.
In addition to two Amnesty International Media Awards in 2004 and 2005, The Baghdad Blogger:
Salam Pax won a Royal Television Society Award in 2005.
A Doctor's Story won an Emmy Award for Best International Current Affairs film in 2007.
In 2008 photojournalist Sean Smith's Inside the Surge won the Royal Television Society award for best international news film – the first time a newspaper has won such an award.
The same year, The Guardian's Katine website was awarded for its outstanding new media output at the One World Media awards.
Again in 2008, GuardianFilms' undercover video report revealing vote rigging by Robert Mugabe's ZANU–PF party during the 2007 Zimbabwe election won best news programme of the year at the Broadcast Awards.
The paper's nickname The Grauniad (sometimes abbreviated as "Graun") originated with the satirical magazine Private Eye.
This anagram played on The Guardian's early reputation for frequent typographical errors, including misspelling its own name as The Gaurdian.
The first issue of the newspaper contained a number of errors, including a notification that there would soon be some goods sold at atction instead of auction.
Fewer typographical errors are seen in the paper since the end of hot-metal typesetting.
One Guardian writer, Keith Devlin, suggested that the high number of observed misprints was due more to the quality of the readership than the misprints' greater frequency.
The newspaper was printed in Manchester until 1961 and the fact that the prints sent to London by train were the early, more error-prone, prints may have contributed to this image as well.
When John Cole was appointed news editor by Alastair Hetherington in 1963, he sharpened the paper's comparatively "amateurish" setup.
Employees of The Guardian and sister paper The Observer have been depicted in the films The Fifth Estate (2013), Snowden (2016) and Official Secrets (2019), while Paddy Considine played a fictional Guardian journalist in the film The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).
The Guardian has been awarded the National Newspaper of the Year in 1998, 2005, 2010 and 2013 by the British Press Awards, and Front Page of the Year in 2002 ("A declaration of war", 12 September 2001).
It was also co-winner of the World's Best-designed Newspaper as awarded by the Society for News Design (2005, 2007, 2013, 2014).
Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism (Nick Davies, 1999; Chris McGreal, 2003; Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, 2005; Ian Cobain, 2009).
and Richa Syal, 2022).
The guardian.co.uk website won the Best Newspaper category three years running in 2005, 2006 and 2007 Webby Awards, beating (in 2005)
The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and Variety.
It has been the winner for six years in a row of the British Press Awards for Best Electronic Daily Newspaper.
The site won an Eppy award from the US-based magazine Editor & Publisher in 2000 for the best-designed newspaper online service.
In 2007, the newspaper was ranked first in a study on transparency that analysed 25 mainstream English-language media vehicles, which was conducted by the International Center for Media and the Public Agenda of the University of Maryland.
It scored 3.8 out of a possible 4.0.
The Guardian US and The Washington Post shared the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for public service reporting for their coverage of the NSA's and GCHQ's worldwide electronic surveillance program and the document leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The Guardian is the sponsor of two major literary awards: The Guardian First Book Award, established in 1999 as a successor to the Guardian Fiction Award, which had run since 1965, and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, founded in 1967.
In recent years the newspaper has also sponsored the Hay Festival in Hay-on-Wye.
The annual Guardian Student Media Awards, founded in 1999, recognise excellence in journalism and design of British university and college student newspapers, magazines and websites.
In memory of Paul Foot, who died in 2004, The Guardian and Private Eye jointly set up the Paul Foot Award, with an annual £10,000 prize fund, for investigative or campaigning journalism.
The newspaper produces The Guardian 100 Best Footballers In The World.
Since 2018 it has also co-produced the female equivalent, The 100 Best Female Footballers In The World.
The Guardian's 100 best novels is a list of the best English-language novels as selected by Robert McCrum.
The Guardian's 100 greatest non-fiction book list has come out in 2011 and in 2017, as selected by Robert McCrum.
The Guardian and its sister newspaper The Observer opened The Newsroom, an archive and visitor centre in London, in 2002.
The centre preserved and promoted the histories and values of the newspapers through its archive, educational programmes and exhibitions.
The Newsroom's activities were all transferred to Kings Place in 2008.
Now known as The Guardian News & Media archive, the archive preserves and promotes the histories and values of The Guardian and The Observer newspapers by collecting and making accessible material that provides an accurate and comprehensive history of the papers.
The archive holds official records of The Guardian and The Observer, and also seeks to acquire material from individuals who have been associated with the papers.
As well as corporate records, the archive holds correspondence, diaries, notebooks, original cartoons and photographs belonging to staff of the papers.
This material may be consulted by members of the public by prior appointment.
An extensive Manchester Guardian archive also exists at the University of Manchester's John Rylands University Library, and there is a collaboration programme between the two archives.
Additionally, the British Library has a large archive of The Manchester Guardian available in its British Library Newspapers collection, in online, hard copy, microform, and CD-ROM formats.
In November 2007, The Guardian and The Observer made their archives available over the internet via DigitalArchive.
The current extent of the archives available are 1821 to 2000 for The Guardian and 1791 to 2000 for The Observer: these archives will eventually run up to 2003.
The Newsroom's other components were also transferred to Kings Place in 2008.
The Guardian's Education Centre provides a range of educational programmes for students and adults.
The Guardian's exhibition space was also moved to Kings Place, and has a rolling programme of exhibitions that investigate and reflect upon aspects of news and newspapers and the role of journalism.
This programme often draws on the archive collections held in the GNM archive.
A tow hitch (or tow bar or trailer hitch in North America) is a device attached to the chassis of a vehicle for towing, or a towbar to an aircraft nose gear.
It can take the form of a tow ball to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer, or a tow pin, or a tow hook with a trailer loop, often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows similar movements.
Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide.
To tow safely, the correct combination of vehicle and trailer must be combined with correct loading horizontally and vertically on the tow ball.
Advice should be heeded (see references) to avoid problems.
Trailer hitches for conventional passenger cars, light-duty commercial vehicles, light trucks, and multipurpose passenger vehicles come in two main OEM or aftermarket types: receiver and bumper/fixed-drawbar.
Receiver-type hitches consist of a portion with a rearward-facing opening that accepts removable aftermarket hitch-mounted accessories: trailer hitch ball mounts, hitch bike racks, cargo carriers, etc. Bumper/fixed-drawbar type hitches typically are built as one piece, have an integrated hole (sometimes more than one hole on pickup trucks) for the trailer ball mount, and are generally not compatible with aftermarket hitch-mounted accessories.
Outside North America, the vehicle mounting for the tow ball is called the tow bracket.
The mounting points for all recent passenger vehicles are defined by the vehicle manufacturer and the tow-bracket manufacturer must use these mount points and prove the efficacy of their bracket for each vehicle by a full rig-based fatigue test.
The trailer hitch ball attaches to a ball mount; with a diameter typically 1⁄16 inch (1.6 mm) larger than the ball bolt/shank diameter.
The ball mount must match the SAE hitch class.
The ballmount for a receiver-type hitch is a square bar that fits into a receiver attached to the vehicle.
Removable ball mounts are offered with a varying rise or drop to accommodate variations in the height of the vehicle and trailer to provide for level towing.
A trailer hitch typically bolts to the chassis of the vehicle.
In North America, there are a few common trailer hitch classes (I, II, III, and IV) that are defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).
Some manufacturers market Class V hitches, but there  was no such standard listed in the 2014 version of SAE J684.
Trailer hitch balls come in various sizes depending on the load they carry and the country of operation, with removable types consisting of a bolt/shank to attach to the ball mount.
The trailer tongue (North America) or coupling (outside North America) slips over a trailer hitch ball attached to a receiver hitch mount or integral with the hitch.
A larger, heavy-duty gooseneck ball size: 3 in (76.2 mm) is typically used for towing greater than 10,000 pounds (4.5 t), and this towing capacity falls outside of the scope of SAE J684 trailer hitch classes.
Weight ratings for both bumper-mounted and frame-mounted receiver hitches can be found on the bumper of pickup trucks (for bumper-mounted tow balls) and on the receiver hitch (for frame-mounted receiver hitches).
For flat deck and pickup trucks towing 10,000-to-30,000-pound (4.5 to 13.6 t) trailers there are fifth wheel and gooseneck hitches.
These are used for agriculture, industry, and large recreational trailers.
Front trailer hitches are also used on pickup trucks, full-size SUVs, and RVs for multiple purposes.
A front-mounted hitch can accommodate additional truck equipment such as front mount bike carriers, fishing/hunting gear, winches, step plates, and snowplows.
It also allows a driver to maneuver a trailer with better visibility into a parking site.
Front trailer hitches are mounted directly to the frame of a vehicle to ensure a reliable connection.
Front hitches are typically equipped with standard-sized receiver tubes to accommodate a variety of removable aftermarket hitch mounted accessories.
In the European Union, tow hitches must be a type approved by European Union directive 94/20/EC requirements and fitted to vehicles first registered on or after 1 August 1998.Outside of North America, the ISO standard tow ball that has been adopted in most of the world is 50 mm (1+31⁄32 in) in diameter and conforms to a standard BS AU 113b (replaced by BS ISO 1103:2007).
With a minor modification, it was published by UNECE on 15 June 2018, as class A. There are two main categories of ISO tow ball: the flange fitting and the swan-neck which has an extended neck fitting into the tow-bracket.
Swan-neck tow balls are often removable to avoid the inconvenience of a tow ball protruding from the vehicle when not required.
Some manufacturers are introducing retractable tow balls as an option.
Across Europe around 25% of vehicles have tow balls fitted—but there are distinct regional variations, being more common in Benelux and Scandinavia.
In Sweden, around 2.2 million cars of around 4.3 million (just over 50%) have tow balls.
In the United Kingdom the popularity of caravans is responsible for a large proportion of four-wheel drive (SUV) vehicles being fitted with tow hitches.
The vehicle must also be electrically connected to the trailer.
Trailer connector variants are standardised at the regional or national and local levels.
Some variants are defined by the ISO standards for trailer connectors.
A car can be equipped with a trailer tow hitch with a removable tow ball.
A weight-distributing hitch is a "load leveling" hitch.
It is a hitch setup mounted on the tow vehicle that uses spring bars and chains under tension to distribute part of the trailer's hitch weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the trailer's axle(s).
It can help reduce trailer sway and hop.
Trailer hop can jerk the tow vehicle.
Trailer sway is also called fishtailing.
At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous.
Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg) and 500 pounds (230 kg) of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch.
Tow vehicles often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.
A lunette ring is a type of trailer hitch that works in combination with a pintle hook on the tow vehicle.
A pintle hook and lunette ring make a more secure coupling, desirable on rough terrain, compared to ball-type trailer hitches.
It is commonly seen in towing applications in agriculture, industry, and the military.
The clearance between the lunette and pintle allows for more relative motion between the trailer and tow vehicle than a ball coupling does.
A disadvantage of that is the "slam" transmitted into the towing vehicle with each push/pull load reversal.
This becomes a tradeoff between a more secure coupling and a more comfortable towing experience.
The  gooseneck hitch mounts in the middle of the truck bed.
This hitch is designed to be paired with a gooseneck trailer, which can manage heavier loads than a hitch at the back of the tow vehicle.
An advantage of the gooseneck hitch is its tighter turning radius, which helps when towing a big flatbed or car hauler.
Gooseneck hitches also enable use of the entire truck bed when not towing.
Before 1932, all trailers used only jaw or hook couplings with an eyelet for trailer towing.
In 1932, Franz Knöbel, of Westfalia-Werke developed the trailer hitch with a ball head and socket joint.
Franz Knöbel patented the ball head-socket joint trailer hitch invention on March 14, 1934.
Westfalia holds a number of towing patents.
Toyota Industries Corporation (株式会社豊田自動織機, Kabushiki gaisha Toyota Jidō Shokki (English "Stock Company Toyota Automatic Loom")) is a Japanese machine maker.
Originally, and still actively (as of 2023), a manufacturer of automatic looms, it is the company from which Toyota Motor Corporation developed.
It is the world's largest manufacturer of forklift trucks measured by revenues.
The company was founded on 18 November 1926 as Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. by Sakichi Toyoda, the inventor of a series of manual and machine-powered looms.
The most significant of these was the 1924 Toyoda Automatic Loom, Type G, a completely automatic high-speed loom featuring the ability to change shuttles without stopping and dozens of other innovations.
At the time it was the world's most advanced loom, delivering a clear improvement in quality and a twenty-fold increase in productivity.
In 1933, the company established its automobile department, led by Kiichiro Toyoda, the eldest son of Sakichi Toyoda.
This department was spun off as Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. in 1937 and is now known as Toyota Motor Corporation.
Toyota Industries is one of 13 core companies of the Toyota Group.
The company owns 8.48% of Toyota Motor and is the largest shareholder (excluding trust revolving funds).
As a countermeasure against hostile merger and acquisition attempts, Toyota Motor currently holds 24.92% of common stock of its origin Toyota Industries.
In 1940, the steel production department of Toyota Industries was spun off as Toyota Steel Works Ltd. (present Aichi Steel Corporation).
In 1944, Toyota Industries's Obu plant, which produces castings, began operations.
Five years later, the Toyota Industries stock was listed on the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya Stock Exchanges.
In 1952, Toyota Industries began producing press die for automobiles.
One year later  the Kyowa plant began to assemble automobiles and produce engines.
In 1956 Toyota unveiled the Model LA 1-ton lift truck, this was the company's first lift truck model.
In 1957, Toyota Industries began producing D-type diesel engines.
That same year, it launched the Model LAT .85-ton towing tractor.
In the final year of the decade, Toyota Industries began producing the P-type gasoline engine.
In 1960, the Kyowa plant was modified to only assemble lift trucks.
That same year, the company began producing the shovel loader and three cylinder crank shaft type compressor.
That same year, Toyota Industries' Development Laboratories and Toyota Central Research were established with funds from ten Toyota group companies.
In 1964, Toyota Industries was recognized by Japan's Ministry of International trade and industry as one of the first Japanese companies to export.
Toyota Industries also unveiled their new automated continuous spinning system.
In 1967, the Toyota Publica entered into production at the company's Nagakusa plant.
Toyota Industries had a monthly output of more than 1,000 units.
In 1971, the company started assembling the Corolla.
In 1973, Toyota Industries reached an output of 3,000 units.
One year later, in 1974, production began on car air-conditioning compressors.
In 1980, the company started producing the JA air.
By 1984, the engine division of Toyota Industries was separated from the vehicle division.
In 1986, Toyota Industries received the Deming Application prize for quality control implementation.
In 1988 Toyota Industrial Equipment is created in Indiana, US.
In 1991, Toyota Industries reached the landmark of 5 million units produced.
A year later, it set up an Environmental Committee.
Toyota Industries is active in five business areas: automotive, materials handling, electronics, logistics, and textile machinery.
Toyota Material Handling USA (TMHU) was formally a separate company, breaking out dealer and sales divisions of the North American business.
Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (TIEM) was formally focused on engineering, manufacturing and responsible for the daily production of forklifts.
In 2018, these two divisions merged, combining the sales and manufacturing business functions into one business entity, now known as Toyota Material Handling Inc. (TMH).
Toyota Industries Corporation is under contract from Toyota Motor Corporation for the production of the Toyota RAV4.
The company manufactures automotive engines for use in Toyota-branded automobiles such as Avensis, Corolla, Crown, and Land Cruiser.
In 2000, Toyota Industries acquired the Swedish-based forklift truck corporation BT Industries, alongside BT's subsidiaries The Raymond Corporation and CESAB.
Combined with Toyota Industries' materials handling division, this created the largest forklift company in the world, Toyota Material Handling Corporation.
In October 2012, Toyota Industries acquired Cascade Corp., a maker of attachments for forklifts, for a price of $728 million.
In 2017, Toyota Industries acquired Vanderlande, a manufacturer of automated material handling equipment, mostly for airports.
In 2022, Toyota Industries acquired viastore, a provider of intralogistics systems, intralogistics software and supporting services.
In 2020, Toyota Industries was manufacturing two state-of-the-art looms: the JAT810 (air jet loom) and LWT810 (water jet loom).
Both looms operate without shuttles.
The water jet loom throws the weft through the warp threads using water, and thus can only be used with synthetic fibers.
The air jet loom uses air to throw the weft, and thus can be use with any fiber.
The company's shares are traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under symbol 6201.T.
A tow truck (also called a wrecker, a breakdown truck, recovery vehicle or a breakdown lorry) is a truck used to move disabled, improperly parked, impounded, or otherwise indisposed motor vehicles.
This may involve recovering a vehicle damaged in an accident, returning one to a drivable surface in a mishap or inclement weather, or towing or transporting one via flatbed to a repair shop or other location.
A tow truck is distinct from a car carrier trailer, which is used to move multiple new or used vehicles simultaneously in routine transport operations.
Ferdinand Porsche of Austro-Daimler developed an artillery tractor for the Austro-Hungarian army in 1908, the M 08.
One of the batch was constructed as a recovery vehicle for the others, with a large winch on the rear platform.
The wrecker (with lifting jib) was invented in 1916 by Ernest Holmes Sr. of Chattanooga, Tennessee, a garage worker who was inspired after he needed blocks, ropes, and six men to pull a car out of a creek.
After improving his design he began manufacturing them commercially.
The International Towing and Recovery Hall of Fame and Museum in his home town displays restored antique wreckers, tools, equipment, and pictorial histories of motor-vehicle towing, a type of work that Holmes originated.
Boom: uses an adjustable boom with a winch to recover vehicles from a ditch, over an embankment, or any place the vehicle cannot be safely reached by backing up.
Some booms are fixed; some use heavy pivoting A-frames; others are equipped with hydraulic-powered telescopic cylinders.
The heaviest types of boom can rotate, effectively turning the tow truck into a sort of mobile crane, called a "rotator", and are usually reserved for incidents involving heavy vehicles.
In the past, boom trucks used a "hook and chain" system where chains are looped around the vehicle frame or axle, then lifted by a boom winch.
A towbar with heavy rubberized mats connects the truck and vehicle, so it can be towed on its other axle.
"Slings" and "belt lifts" are a further development, with rubber straps replacing part of the chains.
Slings are not used much today because they can scratch the bumpers of cars.
However, they are sometimes used for towing vehicles that have been in an accident or have one or two of the front or rear wheels missing, or for pickup trucks and other vehicles that have steel bumpers.
Cars equipped with all-wheel drive cannot be towed with a sling, as it can cause problems with the car's drivetrain.
Wheel-lift (also called a "spectacle lift" or "underlift"): developed from the hook-and-chain technology to produce a large metal yoke that can be fitted under the front or rear wheels to cradle them, drawing the front or rear end of the vehicle clear of the ground by a pneumatic or hydraulic hoist so it can be towed.
This apparatus generally picks up the drive wheels of the vehicle (i.e. the front wheels if it is front-wheel drive, the rear wheels if it is rear-wheel drive), touching only the tires.
The wheel lift was designed by Arthur W. Nelson of Weld Built Body Co. in 1967.
The name spectacle lift is common in the UK; the cradle resembles a pair of squared spectacles (eyeglasses).
Medium and heavy trucks use a variation, the "underlift" or "chassis lift", which lifts the axle or frame instead of the wheels.
Wheel-lift trucks can have adapters which can also lift the chassis.
Integrated (also called a "self-loader", "snatcher", "quick pick" or "repo truck"): boom and wheel-lift integrated into one unit.
Used in light-duty trucks to repossess vehicles or move illegally-parked vehicles.
Most have controls for the apparatus inside the cab of the tow truck to make quick pickup possible without the inconvenience of exiting the truck to hook up the vehicle.
Though similar to a wheel-lift truck, an integrated truck differs in that the end of its boom features movable arms that can more easily and quickly clamp onto the wheels of a vehicle, often controlled from the cabin of the truck.
On a wheel-lift truck, the wheels of a vehicle must be manually secured to the yoke by the operator before being lifted.
There are also heavy-duty trucks manufactured with integrated lifts.
Flatbed (also called a "rollback", "slide" or "tilt tray"): the entire back of the truck is fitted with a bed that can be hydraulically inclined and slid back to ground level, allowing the vehicle to be placed on it under its own power or pulled on by a winch.
Because they carry rather than tow the vehicle, they can be used on a completely immobile vehicle; in the US, they are used to carry badly-damaged cars from crashes.
Lift flatbed: a boom uses a wheel-lift frame to lift the vehicle vertically and load it on the bed.
This type of truck can remove vehicles that are parallel-parked.
It is commonly used in Europe.
These are the most common arrangements; others also exist, such as flatbed units that offer a wheel-lift, boom trucks that can recover but not tow, and wheel-lift units that offer a combination boom with sling.
There are also several sizes and weight categories of tow truck.
The lightest models are usually based on light truck and van chassis offering boom and tow weights of around 5 to 10 short tons (4.5–9.1 metric tons), making them ideal for car towing.
Medium-duty tow trucks have a boom capacity of 15 to 20 short tons (14–18 metric tons).
Heavy-duty tow trucks, based on chassis used by semi-trucks, with multiple axles and the ability to tow fully-loaded semi-truck and trailer combinations, have a boom capacity from 25 to 50 short tons (23–45 metric tons).
Rotators are the heaviest type of tow truck, ranging from 40 to 75 short tons (36–68 metric tons)
(though lighter models do exist) and often come with many other features per customer specification.
Most flatbed-type vehicles are based on medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks to provide the chassis strength necessary to carry entire vehicles.
Tow trucks are usually operated by private businesses, except for major highways and toll roads, where the road authority may operate the tow trucks for that stretch of road.
Some police departments own tow trucks; in the US, however, it is common to contract police tows to private companies.
Businesses who operate a large fleet of vehicles, such as school bus companies or package delivery services, often own one or several tow trucks for the purposes of towing their own vehicles.
Government departments with large fleets (such as the police departments, fire departments, transportation authorities and departments of public works of major cities) may similarly own one or more tow trucks.
Police department tow trucks may also be used to impound other vehicles.
Heavy tow trucks are often called to clear semi-truck accidents and straighten out jackknifed trucks.
In rural or unorganized areas, companies which operate tow trucks can sometimes also offer additional services appropriate to highway clearance where government-provided ones are unavailable, such as fire suppression.
The military also deploys tow trucks for recovery of stranded vehicles.
In the US Army, a variant of the HEMTT truck is used for this purpose, the M984 wrecker.
For recovery in combat situations while under fire, many armies with large vehicle fleets also deploy armoured recovery vehicles.
These vehicles fulfill a similar role, but are resistant to heavy fire and capable of traversing rough terrain with their tracks, as well as towing vehicles beyond the weight limits of wheeled wreckers, such as tanks (many are based on tank designs for this reason).
Each state and territory of Australia has its own regulations and acts for the operation of tow trucks.
Tow trucks are generally divided into two categories, either by standard, trade and private towing or accident towing.
Accident towing tow trucks are clearly identifiable by number plates ending in either "ATT" or "TT".
Tow trucks that are not endorsed for accident towing may use general number plates of any combination pursuant to each state's own registering system.
An example of a statute regulating the operation of tow trucks and towing companies in Victoria is the Victorian Accident Towing Services Act.
Some jurisdictions may allow Tow Trucks to be considered as emergency vehicles, and use sirens, with the State of Missouri being a notable example.
A torsion bar suspension, also known as a torsion spring suspension, is any vehicle suspension that uses a torsion bar as its main weight-bearing spring.
One end of a long metal bar is attached firmly to the vehicle chassis; the opposite end terminates in a lever, the torsion key, mounted perpendicular to the bar, that is attached to a suspension arm, a spindle, or the axle.
Vertical motion of the wheel causes the bar to twist around its axis and is resisted by the bar's torsion resistance.
The effective spring rate of the bar is determined by its length, cross section, shape, material, and manufacturing process.
Torsion bar suspensions are used on combat vehicles and tanks like the T-72, Leopard 1, Leopard 2, M26 Pershing, M18 Hellcat, M48 Patton, M60 Patton and the M1 Abrams (many tanks from World War II used this suspension), and on modern trucks and SUVs from Ford, Chrysler, GM, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan, Isuzu, LuAZ, and Toyota.
Class 8 truck manufacturer Kenworth also offered a torsion bar suspension for its K100C and W900A models, up to about 1981.
Manufacturers change the torsion bar or key to adjust the ride height, usually to compensate for engine weight.
The main advantages of a torsion bar suspension are soft ride due to elasticity of the bar, durability, easy adjustability of ride height, and small profile along the width of the vehicle.
It takes up less of the vehicle's interior volume than coil springs.
Torsion bars reached the height of their popularity on mass-production road cars in the middle of the 20th century at the same time that unitary construction was being adopted.
At a time when the mechanics of stress and metal fatigue in unitary body frames was poorly understood, torsion bars were very attractive to vehicle designers as the bars could be mounted to reinforced parts of the central structure, typically the bulkhead.
Using MacPherson struts to achieve independent front suspension with coil springs meant providing strong turrets in the frontal structure of the car.
A disadvantage is that torsion bars, unlike coil springs, usually cannot provide a progressive spring rate.
In most torsion bar systems, ride height (and therefore many handling features) may be changed by simply adjusting bolts that connect the torsion bars to the frame cross member.
In most cars with this type of suspension, swapping torsion bars for a different spring rate is usually an easy task.
Longitudinal torsion bars extend under the passenger compartment, cutting into interior space by raising the floor, while in transverse systems, torsion bar length is limited by vehicle width.
Some vehicles use torsion bars to provide automatic leveling, using a motor to pre-stress the bars to provide greater resistance to load and, in some cases (depending on the speed with which the motors can act), to respond to changes in road conditions.
Height adjustable suspension has been used to implement a wheel-change mode where the vehicle is raised on three wheels so that the remaining wheel is lifted off the ground without the aid of a jack.
This example is of a vehicle that uses oleopneumatic suspension where a high pressure pump primes a pressure reservoir that feeds terminating spheres with hydraulic oil (LHM) to achieve suspension.
The ride height is maintained by cross-linking front and rear suspension spheres using hydraulic connecting pipes.
(The two previous sentences refer to two different oleo-pneumatic suspension systems and are best ignored in the context of torsion bars.
The principle of wheel change by suspension height adjustments has already been explained earlier in the paragraph).
The first vehicle to use torsion bars was Leyland Eight designed by J. G. Parry-Thomas and produced from 1920 to 1923, however its rear suspension, patented in 1919, was retrospectively named "torsion bar assisted" by Leyland in a 1966 publication because the bars only complemented the leaf springs.
Less than two dozen cars (including racing variants) were produced, and the suspension was only ever used again on Marlborough-Thomas racing cars few years later.
In 1923 Parry-Thomas patented an updated design featuring a true torsion bar design with no leaf springs, however the inventor's death in a car crash in 1927 prevented its further development.
Therefore the invention is often credited to the Porsche GmbH, which patented it in 1931 and later used in a lot of designs.
The front wheel drive Citroën Traction Avant from 1934 was the first to implement the idea in a serially produced car, featuring independent front torsion bar suspension and a flexible trailing dead axle, also sprung by torsion bars.
The flexibility of the axle beam provided wheel location features like a twist beam axle.
Also in the 1930s, Porsche's prototypes of the first Volkswagen Beetle incorporated torsion bars—especially their transverse mounting style.
Czechoslovakian Tatra's 1948 T600 Tatraplan employed rear torsion bar suspension, the only Tatra to do so.
The system first saw military use in the Swedish Stridsvagn L-60 tank of 1934.
Its suspension was developed by German engineers, including Porsche employee Karl Rabe who also held patents on torsion bar suspensions personally.
It was used extensively in European cars like Renault, Citroën and Porsche/Volkswagen, by less known producers like Mathis and Röhr in the 1930s, as well as by American Packard in the 1950s.
The Packard used torsion bars at both front and rear, and interconnected the front and rear systems to improve ride quality.
Morris Minor and Oxford from the late 1940s onwards used a front torsion bar system very similar to the Citroën,  as did the Riley RM models.
The revolutionary Jaguar E-Type introduced in 1961 had a torsion bar front suspension very similar to the Citroën and Morris Minor, and an independent coil spring rear suspension using four shock absorbers with concentric springs (coilover).
An early application of a torsion bar in an American car was by Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit who had introduced the innovative front axle flex suspension in 1934 Hudson and Terraplane cars and realized for 1935 that a transverse torsion bar linked to the rear axle was needed as an anti-roll bar to stabilize the cars.
The single torsion bar was mounted through the frame sides behind the rear axle and then attached by arms and links to the front side of the spring U-bolt plates.
Axle flex was discontinued for the 1936 model year.
Gladeon M. Barnes and Warren E. Preston filed a US patent application for a torsion bar suspension in 1934, which was approved two years later.
The original feature of the patent was what is now called tube-over-bar (TOB) design which only saw limited use in the 1960s (for example, on LVTP-7).
Even though Barnes was employed by the US Army Ordnance Department, torsion bars were not used in American armor designs until the T70 GMC in 1943, which suspension was derived from Pz.
III by GM engineer Robert Schilling.
Post-war the use of torsion bar front suspension was a defining feature of British Morris cars, starting with the Morris Minor of 1948, its larger Morris Oxford MO counterpart and the upmarket Morris Six MS, plus the Wolseley-badged upmarket variants of the latter two models.
The designer of these cars, Alec Issigonis, was inspired by the Traction Avant's suspension, although the Morris cars were rear-wheel drive and used conventional leaf springs for their rear axles.
The Minor used lever arm dampers with its torsion bars while the Oxford and the Six used innovative telescopic dampers.
The Minor remained in production largely unchanged until 1972 and was replaced by the Morris Marina which also used the torsion bar-lever arm damper system for its front suspension—one of the last new cars worldwide to be introduced with the system and which remained in production until 1984.
The Oxford/Six platform was developed through several revised series which used Issigonis' torsion bar system until 1959 when the new Farina Oxford was introduced using front suspension with coil springs, lower wishbones and lever arm dampers.
The most famous American passenger car application of the torsion bar, was the Chrysler system used beginning with all Chrysler products starting with the 1957 model year in cars such as the Imperial Crown series, Chrysler Windsor, DeSoto Firedome, Dodge Coronet and Plymouth Belevedere although Chrysler's "Torsion-Air" suspension was only for the front axle; the same basic system (longitudinal mounting) was maintained until the 1981 introduction of the K-car.
A reengineered torsion bar suspension, introduced with the 1976 Dodge Aspen, introduced transverse-mounted torsion bars (possibly based on the Volkswagen Type 3 passenger car) until production ended in 1989 (with Chrysler's M platform).
Some generations of the Dodge Dakota and Durango used torsion bars on the front suspension.
General Motors first used torsion bars on their light-duty pickup trucks in 1960 until it was phased out in 1963 where traditional coil springs are used up front for their 2WD trucks.
Its first use in a passenger car was in 1966, starting with the E-platform vehicles (Oldsmobile Toronado, Cadillac Eldorado), 4WD S-10 pickups and Astro vans with optional AWD, and since 1988, full size trucks and SUVs with 4WD (GMT400, GMT800, and GMT900 series).
Porsche used four-wheel torsion bar suspension for their 356 and 911 series from 1948 until 1989 with the introduction of the 964.
They are also used in the front suspension of the 914 as well as the rear suspension of the 924, 944, and 968.
Honda also used front torsion bars on the third generation Civic and other variants built on the same platform including the Ballade and first generation CRX.
The German World War II Panther tank had double torsion bars.
Needing bars longer than the width of the tank to get the required spring rate and maximum elastic bend angle from available steel alloys, designer Ernst Lehr created a suspension that effectively folded the bars in half.
For each wheel, one rod was attached to the suspension arm, while another was mounted to a nearby point on the frame.
On the opposite side of the tank, the two rods were attached to each other and fitted into a pivot.
Deflection of the suspension arm caused both halves of the double torsion bar to twist.
A disadvantage of the torsion bar suspension used in Tiger and Panther tanks (and many other WWII-era tanks and other AFVs) was the inability to incorporate an escape hatch through the bottom of the hull, a common feature of WWII-era tanks, as the torsion bar arrangement would have blocked crew access to such a hatch; however, the absence of leaf, coil or volute springs often left a large expanse of the side of the hull clear to include a side-escape hatch, and it was rare for a tank to be flipped over in such a way that all top-side hatches were unable to open, which is the purpose of ventral hatches.
Many contemporary main battle tanks use torsion bar suspension, including the American M1 Abrams, German Leopard 2, and Chinese MBT-3000, though the newest generation of tanks such as the Russian T-14 Armata utilize an adjustable hydraulic suspension.
Due to their small size, tremendous load capacity, and relative ease of service, torsion bar suspension has been ideal for tanks, though it is not without disadvantage.
The large travel and high elasticity of the torsion bars results in a "rocking" motion when the tank is moving or coming to a sudden stop.
A gun stabilizer must be used to compensate for the rocking motion.
Due to the massive weight of a main battle tank, compared to an automobile, there is a much greater risk of breaking a torsion bar on sudden bumps or maneuvers, and if it is not replaced in short order the reduced suspension can affect the maneuverability of the vehicle, and in extreme cases risk immobilizing the vehicle as the reduced capacity of the suspension causes additional torsion bars to break.
Torsion bars were sometimes used instead of conventional coil valve springs in some older motorcycles, such as the Honda CB450, and also on the Panhard Dyna X and Panhard Dyna Z cars of the 1950s.
They were also used in the door mechanism of the DMC DeLorean automobile and trunk lids of some Toyota Corolla (E30) models.

A torque converter is a device, usually implemented as a type of fluid coupling, that transfers rotating power from a prime mover, like an internal combustion engine, to a rotating driven load.
In a vehicle with an automatic transmission, the torque converter connects the prime mover to the automatic gear train, which then drives the load.
It is thus usually located between the engine's flexplate and the transmission.
The equivalent device in a manual transmission is the mechanical clutch.
A torque converter serves to increase transmitted torque when the output rotational speed is low.
In the fluid coupling embodiment, it uses a fluid, driven by the vanes of an input impeller, and directed through the vanes of a fixed stator, to drive an output turbine in such a manner that torque on the output is increased when the output shaft is rotating more slowly than the input shaft, thus providing the equivalent of an adaptive reduction gear.
This is a feature beyond what a simple fluid coupling provides, which can match rotational speed but does not multiply torque.
Fluid-coupling–based torque converters also typically include a lock-up function to rigidly couple input and output and avoid the efficiency losses associated with transmitting torque by fluid flow when operating conditions permit.
By far the most common form of torque converter in automobile transmissions is the hydrodynamic device described above.
There are also hydrostatic systems which are widely used in small machines such as compact excavators.
Variomatic with expanding pulleys and a belt drive.
Automatic transmissions on automobiles, such as cars, buses, and on/off highway trucks.
Forwarders and other heavy duty vehicles.
Marine propulsion systems.
Industrial power transmission such as conveyor drives, almost all modern forklifts, winches, drilling rigs, construction equipment, and railway locomotives.
The equation expands to include the fifth power of radius; as a result, torque converter properties are very dependent on the size of the device.
Mathematical formulations for the torque converter are available from several authors.
A simpler correlation is provided by Kotwicki.
A fluid coupling is a two-element drive that is incapable of multiplying torque, while a torque converter has at least one extra element—the stator—which alters the drive's characteristics during periods of high slippage, producing an increase in output torque.
In a torque converter there are at least three rotating elements: the impeller, which is mechanically driven by the prime mover; the turbine, which drives the load; and the stator, which is interposed between the impeller and turbine so that it can alter oil flow returning from the turbine to the impeller.
The classic torque converter design dictates that the stator be prevented from rotating under any condition, hence the term stator.
In practice, however, the stator is mounted on an overrunning clutch, which prevents the stator from counter-rotating with respect to the prime mover but allows forward rotation.
Modifications to the basic three element design have been periodically incorporated, especially in applications where higher than normal torque multiplication is required.
Most commonly, these have taken the form of multiple turbines and stators, each set being designed to produce differing amounts of torque multiplication.
For example, the Buick Dynaflow automatic transmission was a non-shifting design and, under normal conditions, relied solely upon the converter to multiply torque.
The Dynaflow used a five-element converter to produce the wide range of torque multiplication needed to propel a heavy vehicle.
Although not strictly a part of classic torque converter design, many automotive converters include a lock-up clutch to improve cruising power transmission efficiency and reduce heat.
The application of the clutch locks the turbine to the impeller, causing all power transmission to be mechanical, thus eliminating losses associated with fluid drive.
The prime mover is applying power to the impeller but the turbine cannot rotate.
For example, in an automobile, this stage of operation would occur when the driver has placed the transmission in gear but is preventing the vehicle from moving by continuing to apply the brakes.
At stall, the torque converter can produce maximum torque multiplication if sufficient input power is applied (the resulting multiplication is called the stall ratio).
The stall phase actually lasts for a brief period when the load (e.g., vehicle) initially starts to move, as there will be a very large difference between pump and turbine speed.
Acceleration.
The load is accelerating but there still is a relatively large difference between impeller and turbine speed.
Under this condition, the converter will produce torque multiplication that is less than what could be achieved under stall conditions.
The amount of multiplication will depend upon the actual difference between pump and turbine speed, as well as various other design factors.
The turbine has reached approximately 90 percent of the speed of the impeller.
Torque multiplication has essentially ceased and the torque converter is behaving in a manner similar to a simple fluid coupling.
In modern automotive applications, it is usually at this stage of operation where the lock-up clutch is applied, a procedure that tends to improve fuel efficiency.
The key to the torque converter's ability to multiply torque lies in the stator.
In the classic fluid coupling design, periods of high slippage cause the fluid flow returning from the turbine to the impeller to oppose the direction of impeller rotation, leading to a significant loss of efficiency and the generation of considerable waste heat.
Under the same condition in a torque converter, the returning fluid will be redirected by the stator so that it aids the rotation of the impeller, instead of impeding it.
The result is that much of the energy in the returning fluid is recovered and added to the energy being applied to the impeller by the prime mover.
This action causes a substantial increase in the mass of fluid being directed to the turbine, producing an increase in output torque.
Since the returning fluid is initially traveling in a direction opposite to impeller rotation, the stator will likewise attempt to counter-rotate as it forces the fluid to change direction, an effect that is prevented by the one-way stator clutch.
Unlike the radially straight blades used in a plain fluid coupling, a torque converter's turbine and stator use angled and curved blades.
The blade shape of the stator is what alters the path of the fluid, forcing it to coincide with the impeller rotation.
The matching curve of the turbine blades helps to correctly direct the returning fluid to the stator so the latter can do its job.
The shape of the blades is important as minor variations can result in significant changes to the converter's performance.
During the stall and acceleration phases, in which torque multiplication occurs, the stator remains stationary due to the action of its one-way clutch.
However, as the torque converter approaches the coupling phase, the energy and volume of the fluid returning from the turbine will gradually decrease, causing pressure on the stator to likewise decrease.
Once in the coupling phase, the returning fluid will reverse direction and now rotate in the direction of the impeller and turbine, an effect which will attempt to forward-rotate the stator.
At this point, the stator clutch will release and the impeller, turbine and stator will all (more or less) turn as a unit.
Unavoidably, some of the fluid's kinetic energy will be lost due to friction and turbulence, causing the converter to generate waste heat (dissipated in many applications by water cooling).
This effect, often referred to as pumping loss, will be most pronounced at or near stall conditions.
In modern designs, the blade geometry minimizes oil velocity at low impeller speeds, which allows the turbine to be stalled for long periods with little danger of overheating (as when a vehicle with an automatic transmission is stopped at a traffic signal or in traffic congestion while still in gear).
A torque converter cannot achieve 100 percent coupling efficiency.
The classic three element torque converter has an efficiency curve that resembles ∩: zero efficiency at stall, generally increasing efficiency during the acceleration phase and low efficiency in the coupling phase.
The loss of efficiency as the converter enters the coupling phase is a result of the turbulence and fluid flow interference generated by the stator, and as previously mentioned, is commonly overcome by mounting the stator on a one-way clutch.
Even with the benefit of the one-way stator clutch, a converter cannot achieve the same level of efficiency in the coupling phase as an equivalently sized fluid coupling.
Some loss is due to the presence of the stator (even though rotating as part of the assembly), as it always generates some power-absorbing turbulence.
Most of the loss, however, is caused by the curved and angled turbine blades, which do not absorb kinetic energy from the fluid mass as well as radially straight blades.
Since the turbine blade geometry is a crucial factor in the converter's ability to multiply torque, trade-offs between torque multiplication and coupling efficiency are inevitable.
In automotive applications, where steady improvements in fuel economy have been mandated by market forces and government edict, the nearly universal use of a lock-up clutch has helped to eliminate the converter from the efficiency equation during cruising operation.
The maximum amount of torque multiplication produced by a converter is highly dependent on the size and geometry of the turbine and stator blades, and is generated only when the converter is at or near the stall phase of operation.
Typical stall torque multiplication ratios range from 1.8:1 to 2.5:1 for most automotive applications (although multi-element designs as used in the Buick Dynaflow and Chevrolet Turboglide could produce more).
Specialized converters designed for industrial, rail, or heavy marine power transmission systems are capable of as much as 5.0:1 multiplication.
Generally speaking, there is a trade-off between maximum torque multiplication and efficiency—high stall ratio converters tend to be relatively inefficient around the coupling speed, whereas low stall ratio converters tend to provide less possible torque multiplication.
The characteristics of the torque converter must be carefully matched to the torque curve of the power source and the intended application.
Changing the blade geometry of the stator and/or turbine will change the torque-stall characteristics, as well as the overall efficiency of the unit.
For example, drag racing automatic transmissions often use converters modified to produce high stall speeds to improve off-the-line torque, and to get into the power band of the engine more quickly.
Highway vehicles generally use lower stall torque converters to limit heat production, and provide a more firm feeling to the vehicle's characteristics.
A design feature once found in some General Motors automatic transmissions was the variable-pitch stator, in which the blades' angle of attack could be varied in response to changes in engine speed and load.
The effect of this was to vary the amount of torque multiplication produced by the converter.
At the normal angle of attack, the stator caused the converter to produce a moderate amount of multiplication but with a higher level of efficiency.
If the driver abruptly opened the throttle, a valve would switch the stator pitch to a different angle of attack, increasing torque multiplication at the expense of efficiency.
Some torque converters use multiple stators and/or multiple turbines to provide a wider range of torque multiplication.
Such multiple-element converters are more common in industrial environments than in automotive transmissions, but automotive applications such as Buick's Triple Turbine Dynaflow and Chevrolet's Turboglide also existed.
The Buick Dynaflow utilized the torque-multiplying characteristics of its planetary gear set in conjunction with the torque converter for low gear and bypassed the first turbine, using only the second turbine as vehicle speed increased.
The unavoidable trade-off with this arrangement was low efficiency and eventually these transmissions were discontinued in favor of the more efficient three speed units with a conventional three element torque converter.
It is also found that efficiency of torque converter is maximum at very low speeds.
As described above, impelling losses within the torque converter reduce efficiency and generate waste heat.
In modern automotive applications, this problem is commonly avoided by use of a lock-up clutch that physically links the impeller and turbine, effectively changing the converter into a purely mechanical coupling.
The result is no slippage, and virtually no power loss.
The first automotive application of the lock-up principle was Packard's Ultramatic transmission, introduced in 1949, which locked up the converter at cruising speeds, unlocking when the throttle was floored for quick acceleration or as the vehicle slowed.
This feature was also present in some Borg-Warner transmissions produced during the 1950s.
It fell out of favor in subsequent years due to its extra complexity and cost.
In the late 1970s lock-up clutches started to reappear in response to demands for improved fuel economy, and are now nearly universal in automotive applications.
is the diameter (m).
In practice, the maximum torque capacity is limited by the mechanical characteristics of the materials used in the converter's components, as well as the ability of the converter to dissipate heat (often through water cooling).
As an aid to strength, reliability and economy of production, most automotive converter housings are of welded construction.
Industrial units are usually assembled with bolted housings, a design feature that eases the process of inspection and repair, but adds to the cost of producing the converter.
In high performance, racing and heavy duty commercial converters, the pump and turbine may be further strengthened by a process called furnace brazing, in which molten brass is drawn into seams and joints to produce a stronger bond between the blades, hubs and annular ring(s).
Because the furnace brazing process creates a small radius at the point where a blade meets with a hub or annular ring, a theoretical decrease in turbulence will occur, resulting in a corresponding increase in efficiency.
Overheating: Continuous high levels of slippage may overwhelm the converter's ability to dissipate heat, resulting in damage to the elastomer seals that retain fluid inside the converter.
A prime example in passenger cars would be getting stuck in snow or mud and having to rock the vehicle forward and backward to gain momentum by going back and forth from drive to reverse using significant power.
The transmission fluid will quickly overheat, not to mention the repeated impacts on the stator clutch (next topic).
Also, overheating transmission fluid causes it to lose viscosity and damage the transmission.
Such abuse can in rare cases cause the torque converter to leak and eventually stop functioning due to lack of fluid.
Stator clutch seizure: The inner and outer elements of the one-way stator clutch become permanently locked together, thus preventing the stator from rotating during the coupling phase.
Most often, seizure is precipitated by severe loading and subsequent distortion of the clutch components.
Eventually, galling of the mating parts occurs, which triggers seizure.
A converter with a seized stator clutch will exhibit very poor efficiency during the coupling phase, and in a motor vehicle, fuel consumption will drastically increase.
Converter overheating under such conditions will usually occur if continued operation is attempted.
Stator clutch breakage: A very abrupt application of power, as in putting the transmission in neutral and increasing engine RPMs before engaging a gear (commonly called a "neutral start"), can cause shock loading of the stator clutch, resulting in breakage.
If this occurs, the stator will freely counter-rotate in the direction opposite to that of the pump and almost no power transmission will take place.
In an automobile, the effect is similar to a severe case of transmission slippage and the vehicle is all but incapable of moving under its own power.
Blade deformation and fragmentation: If subjected to abrupt loading or excessive heating of the converter, pump and/or turbine blades may be deformed, separated from their hubs and/or annular rings, or may break up into fragments.
At the least, such a failure will result in a significant loss of efficiency, producing symptoms similar (although less pronounced) to those accompanying stator clutch failure.
In extreme cases, catastrophic destruction of the converter will occur.
Ballooning: Prolonged operation under excessive loading, very abrupt application of load, or operating a torque converter at very high RPM may cause the shape of the converter's housing to be physically distorted due to internal pressure and/or the stress imposed by inertia.
Under extreme conditions, ballooning will cause the converter housing to rupture, resulting in the violent dispersal of hot oil and metal fragments over a wide area.

Trafficators are semaphore signals which, when operated, protrude from the bodywork of a motor vehicle to indicate its intention to turn in the direction indicated by the pointing signal.
Trafficators are often located at the door pillar.
They first appeared in the 1900s, when they were actuated either mechanically or pneumatically.
In 1908, Alfredo Barrachini in Rome  added electric lights inside the arms that turned on as they extended, but operation was still by a cable system.
Electric operation came in 1918 when the Naillik Motor Signal Company of Boston added electric motor drive.
This system was superseded by two French inventors, Gustave Deneef and Maurice Boisson, who used a linear solenoid in 1923.
The final complete system came in 1927 when Berlin-based Max Ruhl and Ernst Neuman combined internal illumination and solenoid operation: (but see Gladstone Adams).
The shape of the trafficator arm is closely based upon the shape of the semaphore signal arm used by the Royal Bavarian Railway beginning in 1890.
The only difference from the railway arm is that it has only one 'blade' of the rail signal's terminal 'arrowhead', so that the retracted trafficator sits flush with the vehicle's exterior.
They were common on vehicles until the introduction of the flashing amber, red or white indicators at or near the corners of the vehicle (and often along the sides as well).
They have been increasingly rare since the 1950s, as ever-stricter legislation has prescribed the need for the modern type of flashing signal.
Many historic vehicles (e.g. pre-1960 Volkswagen Beetle) that are used on today's roads have had their trafficators supplemented or replaced with modern indicators to aid visibility and to meet legislative requirements.
In some countries trafficators may now be retro-fitted with flashing lights.

The name Corolla is part of Toyota's naming tradition of using names derived from the Toyota Crown for sedans, with "corolla" Latin for "small crown".
The Corolla has always been exclusive in Japan to Toyota Corolla Store locations, and manufactured in Japan with a twin, called the Toyota Sprinter until 2000.
From 2006 to 2018 in Japan and much of the world, and from 2018 to 2020 in Taiwan, the hatchback companion had been called the Toyota Auris.
Early models were mostly rear-wheel drive, while later models have been front-wheel drive.
Four-wheel drive versions have also been produced, and it has undergone several major redesigns.
The Corolla's traditional competitors have been the Nissan Sunny, introduced the same year as the Corolla in Japan and the later Nissan Sentra, Subaru Leone, Honda Civic and Mitsubishi Lancer.
The Corolla's chassis designation code is "E", as described in Toyota's chassis and engine codes.
Corollas are manufactured in Japan at the original Takaoka plant built in 1966.
Various production facilities have been built in Brazil, (Indaiatuba, São Paulo), Canada (Cambridge, Ontario), China (Tianjin), Pakistan (Karachi), South Africa (Durban), Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey (Sakarya), and the United Kingdom (Derbyshire).
Production or assembly has previously been carried out in Australia (Dandenong and Altona), India (Bangalore), Indonesia (Jakarta), Malaysia (Shah Alam), New Zealand (Thames), the Philippines (Santa Rosa, Laguna), and Venezuela.
Corollas were made at NUMMI in Fremont, California until March 2010.
Production resumed in November 2011 at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Mississippi in Blue Springs, Mississippi.
The first generation Corolla was introduced in November 1966 with the new 1100 cc K pushrod engine.
The Corolla Sprinter was introduced as the fastback version in 1968, and exclusive to a Toyota Japan dealership retail outlet called Toyota Auto Store.
It was the second car available to Japanese buyers at Toyota Corolla Store next to the Toyota Publica.
In May 1970, the E20 was restyled with a more rounded body.
The now mutually exclusive Corolla and Sprinter names were used to differentiate between two slightly different treatments of sheet metal and trim.
The Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno names were introduced as the enhanced performance version of the Corolla and Sprinter respectively when a double overhead camshaft version of the 2T engine was introduced in March 1972 (TE27).
In September 1970, the 1400 cc T and 1600 cc 2T OHV engines were added to the range.
In Australia, only the 1.2 L engine (3K) powered 2-door KE20 was available as a sedan and wagon / panelvan.
The brakes were single system with no booster, solid discs on the front and rear drums.
Front sway bar but no rear sway bar.
Parts are not compatible with later models.
In New Zealand, the 4-door KE20 was available.
Most models stopped production in July 1974 but the KE26 wagon and van were still marketed in Japan alongside the new 30-series, until production finally ended in May 1978.
April 1974 brought rounder, bigger and heavier Corollas and Sprinters.
The range was rounded out with the addition of a two-door liftback.
The Corollas were given E30 codes while the Sprinters were given E40 codes.
A facelift in March 1976 saw most Corolla E30 models replaced by equivalent E50 models and most Sprinter E40 models were replaced by equivalent E60 models.
The E30 Corolla was fitted with retracting front seat belts.
In Australia, the KE3x/KE5x was available as 4-door sedan (KE30/KE55), 2-door sedan (KE30), 2-door hardtop coupe (KE35/KE55), 2-door panel van (KE36/KE38), 4-door wagon (KE36/KE38) and a 2-door liftback (KE50/KE55).
All KE3x models had 3K engines and K40 4-speed manual, K50 5 speed manual, 2-speed automatic or 3-speed automatic gearbox.
Sprinters were not available.
The KE5x models 4K engines.
The KE55 was 50 kg heavier due to the addition of side impact protection in the doors, but due to a change in the body metal and seam sealing they are prone to rust.
Later KE55s also used plastic ended bumper bars as opposed to the all chrome bumpers of the previous models, but included a rear sway bar for the first time.
A major restyle in March 1979 brought a square edged design.
The Corollas had a simpler treatment of the grill, headlights and tail lights while the Sprinter used a slightly more complex, sculptured treatment.
The new A series engines were added to the range as a running change.
This was the last model to use the K "hicam" and T series engines.
Fuel injection was introduced as an extra cost option on Japanese market vehicles.
The wagon and van continued to be made until June 1987 after the rest of the range was replaced by the E80 generation.
A sloping front bonnet and a contemporary sharp-edged, no-frills style was brought in during May 1983.
The new 1839 cc 1C diesel engine was added to the range with the E80 Series.
From 1985, re-badged E80 Sprinters were sold in the U.S. as the fifth-generation Chevrolet Nova.
Fuel injection was introduced as an extra cost option internationally.
Most models now used the front-wheel drive layout except the AE85 and AE86, which were to be the last Corollas offered in the rear-wheel drive or FR layout.
The AE85 and AE86 chassis codes were also used for the Sprinter (including the Sprinter Trueno).
The Sprinter was nearly identical to the Corolla, differing only by minor body styling changes such as pop-up headlights.
This generation was made until 1990 in Venezuela.
A somewhat more rounded and aerodynamic style was used for the E90 introduced in May 1987.
Overall this generation has a more refined feel than older Corollas and other older subcompacts.
Most models were now front-wheel drive, along with a few AWD All-Trac models.
Many engines were used on a wide array of trim levels and models, ranging from the 1.3-liter 2E to the 123 kilowatts (165 hp) supercharged 4A-GZE.
In the US, the E90 Sprinter was built and sold as both the Toyota Sprinter and the Geo Prizm.
In Australia, the E90 Corolla was built and sold as both the Toyota Corolla and the Holden Nova.
In South Africa, this generation continued to be built until August 2006.
In June 1991, Corollas received a redesign to be larger, heavier, and have the completely rounded, aerodynamic shape of the 1990s.
In the United States, the somewhat larger Corolla was now in the compact class, rather than subcompact, and the coupé was still available in some markets, known as the AE101 Corolla Levin.
Carburetors were mostly retired with this generation.
Production of the E110 Corolla started in May 1995.
The design of the car was slightly altered throughout but retained a look similar to that of the E100.
In 1998, for the first time, some non-Japanese Corollas received the new 1ZZ-FE engine.
The 1ZZ-FE engine had an aluminum engine block and aluminum cylinder heads, which made models powered by this motor lighter than versions powered by A series engines which had cast iron blocks with aluminium heads.
The model range began to change as Toyota decided styling differences would improve sales in different markets.
Starting with this generation, General Motors renamed the Geo Prizm, a rebadge of the Toyota Sprinter, as the Chevrolet Prizm when the Geo brand was discontinued.
This generation was delayed in North America until mid-1997 (US 1998 model year), where it had unique front and rear styling.
Europe and Australasia received versions of their own as well.
In Pakistan, this model was halted in November 1998, while production was closed in March 2002.
In August 2000, the E120 ninth-generation Corolla was introduced in Japan, with edgier styling and more technology to bring the nameplate into the 21st century.
This version was sold in Japan, Australasia, Europe and the Middle East.
In mid-2001, the E120 Corolla Altis was released.
It had a refreshed look and was slightly longer and wider than the E120 for other markets, but with similar body panels and interior.
The Altis was sold in Southeast Asia, India, and Taiwan.
India received a de-tuned version of the 1ZZ-FE and was comparatively slower than its rivals.
The North American release was delayed until March 2002 (for the 2003 model year).
The E130 was sold in North America from 2003 to 2008.
It had similar look to the Corolla Altis sold in Southeast Asia.
The E120 continued in parallel in separate markets to the E130.
The station wagon model is called the Corolla Fielder in Japan.
Production in Japan ended in January 2007 (for Corolla Runx and Allex), but production in North America continued until October 2007.
Production continued in China as the Corolla EX until February 2017.
The tenth generation of the E140 Corolla was introduced in October 2006.
Japanese markets called the sedan Corolla Axio.
The station wagon retained the Corolla Fielder name.
For international markets, a wider version of the E140 was sold with different styling, with the Southeast Asian, Pakistani, Indian and Taiwanese markets retaining the Corolla Altis branding.
Production continued from June 2014 until 2020 in South Africa as the entry-level Corolla Quest.
In Australasia, the related first-generation Toyota Auris was also sold as the Corolla hatchback alongside the sedan body shape of the International E140 Corolla.
The eleventh generation of the Corolla went on sale in Japan in May 2012.
The sedan is named the Corolla Axio while the wagon is called the Corolla Fielder.
In Japan, both are made by a Toyota subsidiary, Central Motors, in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.
The redesigned model has slightly smaller exterior dimensions and is easier to drive in narrow alleys and parking lots for the targeted elderly drivers.
The new Corolla Axio is available with either a 1.3-liter 1NR-FE or 1.5-liter 1NZ-FE four-cylinder engines; front- or all-wheel drive.
Both 5-speed manual and CVT transmissions are offered.
The 1.3-liter engine and all-wheel-drive variants are available only with the CVT transmission.
The Corolla Fielder is available with 1.5-liter 1NZ-FE or 1.8-liter 2ZR-FAE four cylinder engines mated with a CVT transmission.
The 1.5-liter is available with front- and all-wheel drive, the 1.8-liter is offered only in front-wheel drive.
Since 2015 there's a new engine 2NR-FKE, with its VVT-ie technology.
Toyota released hybrid versions of the Corolla Axio sedan and Corolla Fielder station wagon for the Japanese market in August 2013.
Both cars are equipped with a 1.5-liter hybrid system similar to the one used in the Toyota Prius C, with a fuel efficiency of 3.03 L/100 km (93.2 mpg‑imp; 77.6 mpg‑US) under the JC08 test cycle.
Toyota's monthly sales target for Japan is 1,000 units of the Corolla Axio hybrid and 1,500 units of the Corolla Fielder hybrid.
The E160 was also sold in Hong Kong, Macau, and New Zealand.
International markets continued on with the E140/E150 until at least 2013 when the E170/E180 model arrived.
The E170/E180 is larger and substantially different from the Japanese E160, with a unique body and interior.
Two basic front and rear styling treatments are fitted to the E170: a North American version that debuted first and a more conservative design for other markets that debuted later in 2013.
The latter version sold in Southeast Asian, Pakistani, Indian and Taiwanese markets retained the Corolla Altis branding.
The Corolla E180 went on sale in Europe and South Africa in February 2014.
In 2015, for the 2016 model year, Toyota’s North American Sub-brand, Scion, introduced the Scion iM, based on the second generation Toyota Auris.
In 2016, for the 2017 model year, the iM was rebranded as the Toyota Corolla iM when the Scion brand was discontinued.
The twelfth generation Corolla in hatchback body style was unveiled as a pre-production model in early March 2018 at the Geneva Motor Show as the Auris.
The production version of the Corolla Hatchback for the North American market was unveiled on 28 March 2018 at the New York International Auto Show, with the official details and photos revealed on 22 March 2018.
The Corolla Hatchback was launched in Japan on 27 June 2018 as the Corolla Sport.
The Corolla Hatchback went on sale in the United States in mid-July 2018, and was later launched in Australia on 7 August 2018.
Production of the European market Corolla Hatchback began on 14 January 2019, and sales began in the UK in February 2019 and across Europe in March 2019.
A high-performance variant of the Corolla hatchback, called the GR Corolla, debuted in March 2022.
The estate variation of the twelfth generation Corolla, called the Corolla Touring Sports (simply called Corolla Touring in Japan), was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show.
The official images of the Corolla Touring Sports were revealed on 4 September 2018.
The Corolla Touring Sports is also sold by Suzuki as the Swace in Europe.
The sedan variation of the Corolla was unveiled simultaneously between 15 and 16 November 2018 in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, United States, and in China at the 2018 Guangzhou International Motor Show.
The model is sold in two versions: Prestige (sold in China, Europe and other countries) and Sporty (sold in North America, Japan, Australia and other countries), and sold in China as the Levin.
The Prestige model uses a different front fascia, which is more similar to the XV70 Camry.
This model is sold as the Corolla Altis in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.
The Sporty model uses a similar front fascia to the hatchback and wagon versions.
A long-wheelbase version of the Prestige model with a slightly altered front fascia is sold as the Allion in China, while the long-wheelbase Sporty version is called the Levin GT.
In Japan, the Corolla has always been exclusive to the Japanese retail sales chain called Toyota Corolla Store, which was previously established in 1961, known as Toyota Publica Store, selling the Publica.
A rebadged version called the Sprinter was introduced around the same time as the Corolla in Japan, and sold through a different Toyota Japan dealership sales channel known since 1966 as Toyota Auto Store.
There have been several models over the years, including the Corolla Ceres (and similar Sprinter Marino) hardtop, Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno sports coupés and hatchbacks, and the Corolla FX hatchback, which became the Corolla RunX, while the Sprinter became the Allex, with the introduction of the E120 series Corolla.
The RunX and Allex was replaced by the Auris in 2006 (known only as Corolla in markets outside Japan, Europe and South Africa).
A luxury version of the Auris installed with V6 engines was briefly sold at Japanese Toyota dealerships Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations as the Blade, which was sold until 2012.
A compact MPV named the Corolla Verso has also been released in European markets.
Its Japanese counterpart is the Corolla Spacio, which has been discontinued as of the tenth generation.
The Corolla Rumion is also sold in the US market as the Scion xB. The Corolla Matrix, better known just as the Matrix, shares the E120 and E140 platforms, and is considered the hatchback/sport wagon counterpart of the North American Corolla sedan, as the European/Australasian Corolla hatchback is not sold there.
Toyota frequently combines the sales figures of the Corolla sedan and Matrix.
The Pontiac Vibe, which is the General Motors badged version of the Matrix, shares the Corolla platform.
The Vibe was exported from Fremont, California, to the Japanese market where it was sold as the Toyota Voltz.
The Corolla Cross is the crossover SUV-counterpart of the E210 series Corolla.
Over many years, there have been rebadged versions of the Corolla, sold by General Motors, including the Holden Nova in Australia during the early 1990s, and the Sprinter-based Chevrolet Nova, Chevrolet Prizm, and Geo Prizm (in the United States as part of the GM S platform).
The Corolla liftback (TE72) of Toyota Australia was badged as simply the T-18.
The five-door liftback was sold with the Corolla Seca name in Australia and the nameplate survived on successive five-door models.
The Daihatsu Charmant was produced from the E30 to the E70 series.
The Tercel was a front wheel drive car, first introduced in 1980 at Japanese Toyota dealerships called Toyota Corolla Store, and was called the Corolla Tercel then, and later given its own name in 1984.
The Tercel platform was also used for the Corolla II hatchback in Japan.
A transaxle is a single mechanical device which combines the functions of an automobile's transmission, axle, and differential into one integrated assembly.
It can be produced in both manual and automatic versions.
Transaxles are nearly universal in all automobile configurations that have the engine placed at the same end of the car as the driven wheels: the front-engine/front-wheel-drive; rear-engine/rear-wheel-drive; and mid-engine/rear-wheel-drive arrangements.
Many mid- and rear-engined vehicles use a transverse engine and transaxle, similar to a front-wheel-drive unit.
Others use a longitudinal engine and transaxle like Ferrari's 1989 Mondial t which used a "T" arrangement with a longitudinal engine connected to a transverse transaxle.
Front-wheel-drive versions of modern Audis, from the A4 upwards, along with their related marques from the Volkswagen Group (which share the same automobile layout) also use a similar layout, but with the transaxle also mounted longitudinally.
The front-wheel-drive Renault 16 had a longitudinal engine and transaxle, with the engine behind the transaxle.
The transaxle case was designed to allow the final-drive ring gear to be on either side of the pinion; this allowed the engine-transaxle assembly to be used in the rear-wheel-drive Lotus Europa, which had the engine in front of the transaxle (i.e., mid-engined).
Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles tend to have the transmission up front just after the engine, but sometimes a front-engine drives a rear-mounted transaxle.
This is generally done for reasons of weight distribution and is therefore common on sports cars.
Another advantage is that since the driveshaft spins at engine speed, it only has to endure the torque of the engine instead of the torque multiplied by the 1st gear ratio.
This design was pioneered in the 1934 Škoda Popular, and then in the 1950 Lancia Aurelia, designed by Vittorio Jano.
Since this placement of the gearbox is unsuitable for a live axle (due to excessive unsprung mass), the rear suspension is either independent, or uses a de Dion tube (notably in Alfa Romeos).
Rare exceptions to this rule were the Bugatti T46 and T50 which had a three speed gearbox on a live axle.
Note:  The C5, C6 and C7 Corvettes, produced in the 1997 to 2019 model years, do not feature an integrated transaxle, where the transmission, axle and differential are combined into a single assembly.
These years actually featured a rear-mounted transmission, which was a stand-alone unit bolted directly to the differential.
While many, including General Motors, refer to this configuration as a transaxle, the first Corvette with an integrated transaxle was produced in the eighth generation Corvette, which was released in the 2020 model year.
All Audi cars with longitudinal engines and their 'trademark' quattro four-wheel-drive (4WD) system, along with their related marques from the Volkswagen Group which share the same layout, utilise a transaxle.
This is mounted immediately behind the front-mounted engine (again, longitudinally) and contains the 'gearbox' (manual, automatic, DSG, or CVT), along with both the centre differential, and the front differential and final drive unit.
2007–on   Nissan GT-R – front-engined, gearbox in the rear.
A "semi trailing-arm" (or semi trailing-link) is a common form of independent rear suspension on automobiles, particularly those with front wheel drive (where it allows a flatter rear floor pan).
Leading arms are similar horizontal arms, perpendicular to the axle, but connecting the wheels to the vehicle structure via pivot joints to the rear of them.
These are typically used on the front axle or wheels, as on the Citroën 2CV and its derivatives, and on the Citroën DS, as well as on the M422 Mighty Mite jeep.
Trailing-arm designs in live axle setups often use just two or three links and a Panhard rod to locate the wheel laterally.
A trailing arm design can also be used in an independent suspension arrangement.
Each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at one point, ahead of the wheel.
Seen from the side, this arm is roughly parallel to the ground, with the angle changing based on road irregularities.
A twist-beam rear suspension is very similar except that the arms are connected by a beam, used to locate the wheels and which twists and has an anti-roll effect.
Some aircraft also use trailing arms in their landing gear, with oleo struts for shock absorption.
A trailing arm landing gear results in smoother landings and a better ride when taxiing compared to other types of landing gear.
A semi-trailing arm suspension is a supple independent rear suspension system for automobiles where each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at two points.
Viewed from the top, the line formed by the two pivots is somewhere between parallel and perpendicular to the car's longitudinal axis; it is generally parallel to the ground.
Trailing-arm and multilink suspension designs are much more commonly used for the rear wheels of a vehicle where they can allow for a flatter floor and more cargo room.
Many small, front-wheel drive vehicles feature a MacPherson strut front suspension and trailing-arm rear axle.
A tire (North American English) or tyre (Commonwealth English) is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel's rim to transfer a vehicle's load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the surface over which the wheel travels.
Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, are pneumatically inflated structures, providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface.
Tires provide a footprint, called a contact patch, designed to match the vehicle's weight and the bearing on the surface that it rolls over by exerting a pressure that will avoid deforming the surface.
The materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric, and wire, along with carbon black and other chemical compounds.
They consist of a tread and a body.
The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air.
Before rubber was developed, tires were metal bands fitted around wooden wheels to hold the wheel together under load and to prevent wear and tear.
Early rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic).
Pneumatic tires are used on many vehicles, including cars, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks, heavy equipment, and aircraft.
Metal tires are used on locomotives and railcars, and solid rubber (or other polymers) tires are also used in various non-automotive applications, such as casters, carts, lawnmowers, and wheelbarrows.
Unmaintained tires can lead to severe hazards for vehicles and people, ranging from flat tires making the vehicle inoperable to blowouts, where tires explode during operation and possibly damage vehicles and injure people.
The manufacture of tires is often highly regulated for this reason.
Because of the widespread use of tires for motor vehicles, tire waste is a substantial portion of global waste.
There is a need for tire recycling through mechanical recycling and reuse, such as for crumb rubber and other tire-derived aggregate, and pyrolysis for chemical reuse, such as for tire-derived fuel.
If not recycled properly or burned, waste tires release toxic chemicals into the environment.
Moreover, the regular use of tires produces micro-plastic particles that contain these chemicals that both enter the environment and affect human health.
The word tire is a short form of attire, from the idea that a wheel with a tire is a dressed wheel.
Tyre is the oldest spelling, and both tyre and tire were used during the 15th and 16th centuries.
During the 17th and 18th centuries, tire became more common in print.
The spelling tyre did not reappear until the 1840s when the English began shrink-fitting railway car wheels with malleable iron.
Nevertheless, many publishers continued using tire.
The Times newspaper in London was still using tire as late as 1905.
The spelling tyre began to be commonly used in the 19th century for pneumatic tires in the UK.
The 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica states that "The spelling 'tyre' is not now accepted by the best English authorities, and is unrecognized in the US", while Fowler's Modern English Usage of 1926 describes that "there is nothing to be said for 'tyre', which is etymologically wrong, as well as needlessly divergent from our own [sc. British] older & the present American usage".
However, over the 20th century, tyre became established as the standard British spelling.
The earliest tires were bands of leather, then iron (later steel) placed on wooden wheels used on carts and wagons.
A skilled worker, known as a wheelwright, would cause the tire to expand by heating it in a forge fire, placing it over the wheel, and quenching it, causing the metal to contract back to its original size to fit tightly on the wheel.
The first patent for what appears to be a standard pneumatic tire appeared in 1847 and was lodged by Scottish inventor Robert William Thomson.
However, this idea never went into production.
The first practical pneumatic tire was made in 1888 on May Street, Belfast, by Scots-born John Boyd Dunlop, owner of one of Ireland's most prosperous veterinary practices.
It was an effort to prevent the headaches of his 10-year-old son Johnnie while riding his tricycle on rough pavements.
His doctor, John, later Sir John Fagan, had prescribed cycling as an exercise for the boy and was a regular visitor.
Fagan participated in designing the first pneumatic tires.
Cyclist Willie Hume demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tires in 1889, winning the tire's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.
In Dunlop's tire patent specification dated 31 October 1888, his interest is only in its use in cycles and light vehicles.
In September 1890, he was made aware of an earlier development, but the company kept the information to itself.
In 1892, Dunlop's patent was declared invalid because of the prior art by forgotten fellow Scot Robert William Thomson of London (patents London 1845, France 1846, USA 1847).
However, Dunlop is credited with "realizing rubber could withstand the wear and tear of being a tire while retaining its resilience".
John Boyd Dunlop and Harvey du Cros worked through the ensuing considerable difficulties.
They employed inventor Charles Kingston Welch and acquired other rights and patents, which allowed them some limited protection of their Pneumatic Tyre business's position.
Pneumatic Tyre would become Dunlop Rubber and Dunlop Tyres.
The development of this technology hinged on myriad engineering advances, including the vulcanization of natural rubber using sulfur, as well as the development of the "clincher" rim for holding the tire in place laterally on the wheel rim.
Synthetic rubbers were invented in the laboratories of Bayer in the 1920s.
Rubber shortages in the United Kingdom during WWII prompted research on alternatives to rubber tires with suggestions including leather, compressed asbestos, rayon, felt, bristles, and paper.
In 1946, Michelin developed the radial tire method of construction.
Michelin had bought the bankrupt Citroën automobile company in 1934 to utilize this new technology.
Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy, use of this technology quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia.
In the US, the outdated bias-ply tire construction persisted until the Ford Motor Company adopted radial tires in the early 1970s, following a 1968 article in an influential American magazine, Consumer Reports, highlighting the superiority of radial construction.
The US tire industry lost its market share to Japanese and European manufacturers, which bought out US companies.
Tires may be classified according to the type of vehicle they serve.
They may be distinguished by the load they carry and by their application, e.g. to a motor vehicle, aircraft, or bicycle.
Snow tires are designed for use on snow and ice.
They have a tread design with larger gaps than those on summer tires, increasing traction on snow and ice.
Such tires that have passed a specific winter traction performance test are entitled to display a "Three-Peak Mountain Snow Flake" symbol on their sidewalls.
Tires designed for winter conditions are optimized to drive at temperatures below 7 °C (45 °F).
Some snow tires have metal or ceramic studs that protrude from the tire to increase traction on hard-packed snow or ice.
Studs abrade dry pavement, causing dust and creating wear in the wheel path.
Regulations that require the use of snow tires or permit the use of studs vary by country in Asia and Europe, and by state or province in North America.
All-season tires are typically rated for mud and snow (M+S).
These tires have tread gaps that are smaller than snow tires and larger than conventional tires.
They are quieter than snow tires on clear roads, but less capable on snow or ice.
All-terrain tires are designed to have adequate traction off-road, yet have benign handling and noise characteristics for highway driving.
Such tires are rated better on snow and rain than street tires and "good" on ice, rock, and sand.
Mud-terrain tires have a deeper, more open tread for good grip in mud, than all-terrain tires, but perform less well on pavement.
High-performance tires are rated for speeds up to 168 miles per hour (270 km/h) and ultra-high-performance tires are rated for speeds up to 186 miles per hour (299 km/h), but have harsher ride characteristics and durability.
Electric vehicles have unique demands on tires due to the combination of weight (resulting in new load index), higher torque, and requirements for lower rolling resistance.
Run-flat tires eliminates the need for a spare tire because they can be traveled on at a reduced speed in the event of a puncture, using a stiff sidewall to prevent damage to the tire rim.
Vehicles without run-flat tires rely on a spare tire, which may be a compact tire, to replace a damaged tire.
Race car tires come in three main categories, DOT (street-legal), slick, and rain.
Race car tires are designed to maximize cornering and acceleration friction at the expense of longevity.
Racing slicks have no tread to maximize contact with the pavement and rain tires have channels to eject water to avoid hydroplaning.
Heavy-duty tires for large trucks and buses come in a variety of profiles and carry loads in the range of 4,000 to 5,500 pounds (1,800 to 2,500 kg) on the drive wheel.
These are typically mounted in tandem on the drive axle.
Truck tires come in a variety of profiles that include "low profile" with a section height that is 70 to 45% of the tread width, "wide-base" for heavy vehicles, and a "super-single" tire that has the same total contact pressure as a dual-mounted tire combination.
Off-road tires are used on construction vehicles, agricultural and forestry equipment, and other applications that take place on soft terrain.
The category also includes machinery that travels over hardened surfaces at industrial sites, ports, and airports.
Tires designed for soft terrain have a deep, wide tread to provide traction in loose dirt, mud, sand, or gravel.
Aircraft, bicycles, and a variety of industrial applications have distinct design requirements.
Aircraft tires are designed for landing on paved surfaces and rely on their landing gear to absorb the shock of landing.
To conserve the weight and space required, they are typically small in proportion to the vehicle that they support.
Most are radial-ply construction.
They are designed for a peak load when the aircraft is stationary, although side loads upon landing are an important factor.
Although hydroplaning is a concern for aircraft tires, they typically have radial grooves and no lateral grooves or sipes.
Some light aircraft employ large-diameter, low-pressure tundra tires for landing on unprepared surfaces in wilderness areas.
Bicycle tires may be designed for riding on roads or over unimproved terrain and may be mounted on vehicles with more than two wheels.
There are three main types: clincher, wired and tubular.
Most bicycle tires are clincher and have a bead that presses against the wheel rim.
An inner tube provides the air pressure and the contact pressure between the bead and wheel rim.
Industrial tires support such vehicles as forklifts, tractors, excavators, road rollers, and bucket loaders.
Those used on smooth surfaces have a smooth tread, whereas those used on soft surfaces typically have large tread features.
Some industrial tires are solid or filled with foam.
Motorcycle tires provide traction, resisting wear, absorbing surface irregularities, and allow the motorcycle to turn via countersteering.
The two tires' contact with the ground affects safety, braking, fuel economy, noise, and rider comfort.
Tire construction spans pneumatic tires used on cars, trucks, and aircraft, but also includes non-automotive applications with slow-moving, light-duty, or railroad applications, which may have non-pneumatic tires.
Following the 1968 Consumer Reports announcement of the superiority of the radial design, radial tires began an inexorable climb in market share, reaching 100% of the North American market in the 1980s.
Radial tire technology is now the standard design for essentially all automotive tires, but other methods have been used.
Radial tire construction utilizes body ply cords extending from the beads and across the tread so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to each other, as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread.
The belts may be cord or steel.
The advantages of this construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance.
Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and in the context of off-roading, decreased "self-cleaning" ability, and lower grip ability at low speeds.
Bias tire (or cross ply) construction utilizes body ply cords that extend diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles in the range of 30 to 40 degrees.
Successive plies are laid at opposing angles forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied.
The design allows the entire tire body to flex easily, providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces.
This cushioning characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased rolling resistance and less control and traction at higher speeds.
A belted bias tire starts with two or more bias plies to which stabilizer belts are bonded directly beneath the tread.
This construction provides a smoother ride that is similar to the bias tire, while lessening rolling resistance because the belts increase tread stiffness.
The design was introduced by Armstrong, while Goodyear made it popular with the "Polyglas" trademark tire featuring a polyester carcass with belts of fiberglass.
The "belted" tire starts two main plies of polyester, rayon, or nylon annealed as in conventional tires, and then placed on top are circumferential belts at different angles that improve performance compared to non-belted bias tires.
The belts may be fiberglass or steel.
Tubeless tires are pneumatic tires that do not require a separate inner tube.
Semi-pneumatic tires have a hollow center, but they are not pressurized.
They are lightweight, low-cost, puncture-proof, and provide cushioning.
These tires often come as a complete assembly with the wheel and even integral ball bearings.
They are used on lawn mowers, wheelchairs, and wheelbarrows.
They can also be rugged, typically used in industrial applications, and are designed to not pull off their rim under use.
An airless tire is a non-pneumatic tire that is not supported by air pressure.
They are most commonly used on small vehicles, such as golf carts, and on utility vehicles in situations where the risk of puncture is high, such as on construction equipment.
Many tires used in industrial and commercial applications are non-pneumatic, and are manufactured from solid rubber and plastic compounds via molding operations.
Solid tires include those used for lawnmowers, skateboards, golf carts, scooters, and many types of light industrial vehicles, carts, and trailers.
One of the most common applications for solid tires is for material handling equipment (forklifts).
Such tires are installed utilizing a hydraulic tire press.
Wooden wheels for horse-drawn vehicles usually have a wrought iron tire.
This construction was extended to wagons on horse-drawn tramways, rolling on granite setts or cast iron rails.
The wheels of some railway engines and older types of rolling stock are fitted with railway tires to prevent the need to replace the entirety of a wheel.
The tire, usually made of steel, surrounds the wheel and is primarily held in place by interference fit.
Aircraft tires may operate at pressures that exceed 200 pounds per square inch (14 bar; 1,400 kPa).
Some aircraft tires are inflated with nitrogen to "eliminate the possibility of a chemical reaction between atmospheric oxygen and volatile gases from the tire inner liner producing a tire explosion".
Pneumatic tires are manufactured in about 450 tire factories around the world.
Tire production starts with bulk raw materials such as rubber, carbon black, and chemicals and produces numerous specialized components that are assembled and cured.
Many kinds of rubber are used, the most common being styrene-butadiene copolymer.
Forecasts for the global automotive tire market indicate continued growth through 2027.
Estimates put the value of worldwide sales volume around $126 billion in 2022, it is expected to reach the value of over $176 billion by 2027.
Production of tires is also experiencing growth.
In 2015, the US manufactured almost 170 million tires.
Over 2.5 billion tires are manufactured annually, making the tire industry a major consumer of natural rubber.
It is estimated that by 2019, 3 billion tires will be to be sold globally every year.
Estimates put worldwide tire production of 2,268 million in 2021 and is predicted to reach 2,665 million tires by 2027.
As of 2011, the top three tire manufacturing companies by revenue were Bridgestone (manufacturing 190 million tires), Michelin (184 million), Goodyear (181 million); they were followed by Continental, and Pirelli.
The Lego group produced over 318 million toy tires in 2011 and was recognized by Guinness World Records as having the highest annual production of tires by any manufacturer.
A tire comprises several components: the tread, bead, sidewall, shoulder, and ply.
The tread is the part of the tire that comes in contact with the road surface.
The portion that is in contact with the road at a given instant in time is the contact patch.
The tread is a thick rubber, or rubber/composite compound formulated to provide an appropriate level of traction that does not wear away too quickly.
The tread pattern is characterized by a system of circumferential grooves, lateral sipes, and slots for road tires or a system of lugs and voids for tires designed for soft terrain or snow.
Grooves run circumferentially around the tire and are needed to channel away water.
Lugs are that portion of the tread design that contacts the road surface.
Grooves, sipes, and slots allow tires to evacuate water.
The design of treads and the interaction of specific tire types with the roadway surface affects roadway noise, a source of noise pollution emanating from moving vehicles.
These sound intensities increase with higher vehicle speeds.
Tires treads may incorporate a variety of distances between slots (pitch lengths) to minimize noise levels at discrete frequencies.
Sipes are slits cut across the tire, usually perpendicular to the grooves, which allow the water from the grooves to escape sideways and mitigate hydroplaning.
Different tread designs address a variety of driving conditions.
As the ratio of tire tread area to groove area increases, so does tire friction on dry pavement, as seen on Formula One tires, some of which have no grooves.
High-performance tires often have smaller void areas to provide more rubber in contact with the road for higher traction, but may be compounded with softer rubber that provides better traction, but wears quickly.
Mud and snow (M&S) tires employ larger and deeper slots to engage mud and snow.
Snow tires have still larger and deeper slots that compact snow and create shear strength within the compacted snow to improve braking and cornering performance.
Wear bars (or wear indicators) are raised features located at the bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit.
When the tread lugs are worn to the point that the wear bars connect across the lugs, the tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service, typically at a remaining tread depth of 1.6 millimetres (0.063 in).
The tire bead is the part of the tire that contacts the rim on the wheel.
This essential component is constructed with robust steel cables encased in durable, specially formulated rubber designed to resist stretching.
The precision of the bead's fit is crucial, as it seals the tire against the wheel, maintaining air pressure integrity and preventing any loss of air.
The bead's design ensures a secure, non-slip connection, preventing the tire from rotating independently from the wheel during vehicle motion.
Additionally, the interplay between the bead's dimensions and the wheel's width significantly influences the vehicle's steering responsiveness and stability, as it helps to maintain the tire’s intended shape and contact with the road.
The sidewall is that part of the tire, or bicycle tire, that bridges between the tread and bead.
The sidewall is largely rubber but reinforced with fabric or steel cords that provide for tensile strength and flexibility.
The sidewall contains air pressure and transmits the torque applied by the drive axle to the tread to create traction but supports little of the weight of the vehicle, as is clear from the total collapse of the tire when punctured.
Sidewalls are molded with manufacturer-specific detail, government-mandated warning labels, and other consumer information.
Sidewall may also have sometimes decorative ornamentation that includes whitewall or red-line inserts as well as tire lettering.
The shoulder is that part of the tire at the edge of the tread as it makes the transition to the sidewall.
Plies are layers of relatively inextensible cords embedded in the rubber to hold its shape by preventing the rubber from stretching in response to the internal pressure.
The orientations of the plies play a large role in the performance of the tire and are one of the main ways that tires are categorized.
Blem (short for "blemished") is a term used for a tire that failed inspection during manufacturing - but only for superficial/cosmetic/aesthetic reasons.
For example, a tire with white painted lettering which is smudged or incomplete might be classified as a "blem".
Blem tires are fully functional and generally carry the same warranty as flawless tires - but are sold at a discount.
The materials of modern pneumatic tires can be divided into two groups, the cords that make up the ply and the elastomer which encases them.
The cords, which form the ply and bead and provide the tensile strength necessary to contain the inflation pressure, can be composed of steel, natural fibers such as cotton or silk, or synthetic fibers such as nylon or kevlar.
Good adhesion between the cords and the rubber is important.
To achieve this the steel cords are coated in a thin layer of brass, various additives will also be added to the rubber to improve binding, such as resorcinol/HMMM mixtures.
The elastomer, which forms the tread and encases the cords to protect them from abrasion and hold them in place, is a key component of pneumatic tire design.
It can be composed of various composites of rubber material – the most common being styrene-butadiene copolymer – with other chemical compounds such as silica and carbon black.
Optimizing rolling resistance in the elastomer material is a key challenge for reducing fuel consumption in the transportation sector.
It is estimated that passenger vehicles consume approximately 5~15% of their fuel to overcome rolling resistance, while the estimate is understood to be higher for heavy trucks.
However, there is a trade-off between rolling resistance and wet traction and grip: while low rolling resistance can be achieved by reducing the viscoelastic properties of the rubber compound (low tangent (δ)), it comes at the cost of wet traction and grip, which requires hysteresis and energy dissipation (high tangent (δ)).
A low tangent (δ) value at 60 °C is used as an indicator of low rolling resistance, while a high tangent (δ) value at 0 °C is used as an indicator of high wet traction.
Designing an elastomer material that can achieve both high wet traction and low rolling resistance is key in achieving safety and fuel efficiency in the transportation sector.
The most common elastomer material used today is a styrene-butadiene copolymer.
It combines the properties of polybutadiene, which is a highly rubbery polymer (Tg = -100 °C) having high hysteresis and thus offering good wet grip properties, with the properties of polystyrene, which is a glassy polymer (Tg = 100 °C) having low hysteresis and thus offering low rolling resistance in addition to wear resistance.
Therefore, the ratio of the two monomers in the styrene-butadiene copolymer is considered key in determining the glass transition temperature of the material, which is correlated to its grip and resistance properties.
Non-exhaust emissions of particulate matter, generated by the wearing down of brakes, clutches, tires, and road surfaces, as well as by the suspension of road dust, constitute a little-known but rising share of emissions from road traffic and significantly harm public health.
Associated components of tires include the wheel on which it is mounted, the valve stem through which air is introduced, and, for some tires, an inner tube that provides the airtight means for maintaining tire pressure.
Wheel— Pneumatic tires are mounted onto wheels that most often have integral rims on their outer edges to hold the tire.
Automotive wheels are typically made from pressed and welded steel, or a composite of lightweight metal alloys, such as aluminum or magnesium.
There are two aspects to how pneumatic tires support the rim of the wheel on which they are mounted.
First, the tension in the cords pull on the bead uniformly around the wheel, except where it is reduced above the contact patch.
Second, the bead transfers that net force to the rim.
Tires are mounted on the wheel by forcing its beads into the channel formed by the wheel's inner and outer rims.
Valve stem— Pneumatic tires receive their air through a valve stem—a tube made of metal or rubber, with a check valve, typically a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles.
They mount directly to the rim, in the case of tubeless tires, or are an integral part of the inner tube.
Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a valve stem attached to an electronic module.
Inner tube— Most bicycle tires, many motorcycle tires, and many tires for large vehicles such as buses, heavy trucks, and tractors are designed for use with inner tubes.
Inner tubes are torus-shaped balloons made from an impermeable material, such as soft, elastic synthetic rubber, to prevent air leakage.
The inner tubes are inserted into the tire and inflated to retain air pressure.
Large inner tubes can be reused for other purposes, such as swimming and rafting (see swim ring), tubing (recreation), sledding, and skitching.
Purpose-built inflatable tori are also manufactured for these uses, offering a choice of colors, fabric covering, handles, decks, and other accessories, and eliminating the protruding valve stem.
The interactions of a tire with the pavement are complex.
A commonly used (empirical) model of tire properties is Pacejka's "Magic Formula".
Some are explained below, alphabetically, by section.
Balance— Wheel-tire combinations require an even distribution of mass around their circumferences to maintain tire balance, while turning at speed.
Tires are checked at the point of manufacture for excessive static imbalance and dynamic imbalance using automatic tire balance machines.
Tires are checked again in the auto assembly plant or tire retail shop after mounting the tire to the wheel.
Assemblies that exhibit excessive imbalance are corrected by applying balance weights to the wheels to counteract the tire/wheel imbalance.
An alternative method to tire balancing is the use of internal tire balancing agents.
These agents take advantage of centrifugal force and inertia to counteract the tire imbalance.
To facilitate proper balancing, most high-performance tire manufacturers place red and yellow marks on the sidewalls to enable the best possible match-mounting of the tire/wheel assembly.
There are two methods of match-mounting high-performance tire-to-wheel assemblies using these red (uniformity) or yellow (weight) marks.
Centrifugal growth— A tire rotating at higher speeds tends to develop a larger diameter, due to centrifugal forces that force the tread rubber away from the axis of rotation.
This may cause speedometer error.
As the tire diameter grows, the tire width decreases.
This centrifugal growth can cause rubbing of the tire against the vehicle at high speeds.
Motorcycle tires are often designed with reinforcements aimed at minimizing centrifugal growth.
Pneumatic trail— Pneumatic trail of a tire is the trail-like effect generated by compliant tires rolling on a hard surface and subject to side loads, as in a turn.
More technically, it is the distance that the resultant force of side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch. ).
Relaxation length— Relaxation length is the delay between when a slip angle is introduced and when the cornering force reaches its steady-state value.
Spring rate— Vertical stiffness, or spring rate, is the ratio of vertical force to vertical deflection of the tire, and it contributes to the overall suspension performance of the vehicle.
In general, the spring rate increases with inflation pressure.
Stopping distance— Performance-oriented tires have a tread pattern and rubber compounds designed to grip the road surface, and so usually have a slightly shorter stopping distance.
However, specific braking tests are necessary for data beyond generalizations.
Camber thrust— Camber thrust and camber force are the force generated perpendicular to the direction of travel of a rolling tire due to its camber angle and finite contact patch.
Circle of forces— The circle of forces, traction circle, friction circle, or friction ellipse is a useful way to think about the dynamic interaction between a vehicle's tire and the road surface.
Contact patch— The contact patch, or footprint, of the tire, is the area of the tread that is in contact with the road surface.
This area transmits forces between the tire and the road via friction.
The length-to-width ratio of the contact patch affects steering and cornering behavior.
Cornering force— Cornering force or side force is the lateral (i.e. parallel to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tire during cornering.
Dry traction— Dry traction is the measure of the tire's ability to deliver traction, or grip, under dry conditions.
Dry traction is a function of the tackiness of the rubber compound.
Force variation— The tire tread and sidewall elements undergo deformation and recovery as they enter and exit the footprint.
Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle.
As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle.
These variations are collectively referred to as tire uniformity.
Tire uniformity is characterized by radial force variation (RFV), lateral force variation (LFV), and tangential force variation.
Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a force variation machine at the end of the manufacturing process.
Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected.
Geometric parameters, including radial runout, lateral runout, and sidewall bulge, are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory at the end of the manufacturing process as a quality check.
Rolling resistance— Rolling resistance is the resistance to rolling caused by deformation of the tire in contact with the road surface.
As the tire rolls, the tread enters the contact area and is deformed flat to conform to the roadway.
The energy required to make the deformation depends on the inflation pressure, rotating speed, and numerous physical properties of the tire structure, such as spring force and stiffness.
Tire makers seek lower rolling resistance tire constructions to improve fuel economy in cars and especially trucks, where rolling resistance accounts for a high proportion of fuel consumption.
Pneumatic tires also have a much lower rolling resistance than solid tires.
Because the internal air pressure acts in all directions, a pneumatic tire is able to "absorb" bumps in the road as it rolls over them without experiencing a reaction force opposite to the direction of travel, as is the case with a solid (or foam-filled) tire.
Self aligning torque— Self-aligning torque, also known as the aligning torque, SAT or Mz, is the torque that a tire creates as it rolls along that tends to steer it, i.e. rotate it around its vertical axis.
Wet traction— Wet traction is the tire's traction, or grip, under wet conditions.
Wet traction is improved by the tread design's ability to channel water out of the tire footprint and reduce hydroplaning.
However, tires with a circular cross-section, such as those found on racing bicycles, when properly inflated have a sufficiently small footprint to not be susceptible to hydroplaning.
For such tires, it is observed that fully slick tires will give superior traction on both wet and dry pavement.
Load sensitivity— Load sensitivity is the behavior of tires under load.
Conventional pneumatic tires do not behave as classical friction theory would suggest.
Namely, the load sensitivity of most real tires in their typical operating range is such that the coefficient of friction decreases as the vertical load, Fz, increases.
Work load— The work load of a tire is monitored so that it is not put under undue stress, which may lead to its premature failure.
Work load is measured in Ton Kilometer Per Hour (TKPH).
The measurement's appellation and units are the same.
The recent shortage and increasing cost of tires for heavy equipment has made TKPH an important parameter in tire selection and equipment maintenance for the mining industry.
For this reason, manufacturers of tires for large earth-moving and mining vehicles assign TKPH ratings to their tires based on their size, construction, tread type, and rubber compound.
The rating is based on the weight and speed that the tire can handle without overheating and causing it to deteriorate prematurely.
The equivalent measure used in the United States is Ton Mile Per Hour (TMPH).
Tire wear is a major source of rubber pollution.
A concern hereby is that vehicle tire wear pollution is unregulated, unlike exhaust emissions.
This occurs through normal contact with roads or terrain; there are several types of abnormal tread wear.
Poor wheel alignment can cause excessive wear of the innermost or outermost ribs.
Gravel roads, rocky terrain, and other rough terrain cause accelerated wear.
Over-inflation above the sidewall maximum can cause excessive wear to the center of the tread.
Modern tires have steel belts built in to prevent this.
Under-inflation causes excessive wear to the outer ribs.
Unbalanced wheels can cause uneven tire wear, as the rotation may not be perfectly circular.
Tire manufacturers and car companies have mutually established standards for tread wear testing that include measurement parameters for tread loss profile, lug count, and heel-toe wear.
Raised bars in the tread channels, which indicate that the tread is becoming worn and therefore unsafe.
Indicators have been required on all new tires since 1968 in the US.
In many countries the Highway Code forbids driving on public roads when the contact surface is flush with any of these bars - this is often defined when the groove depth is approximately 1.5 or 1.6 mm (2/32 inch).
TWI can also be used to refer to small arrows or icons on the tire sidewall, indicating the location of the raised wear bars.
Tire aging or "thermo-oxidative degradation" can be caused by time, ambient and operating temperatures, partial pressure of O2 in a tire, flex fatigue, or construction and compounding characteristics.
For example, prolonged UV exposure leads to rubber's chemicals warping, potentially causing dry rot.
Various storage methods may slow the aging process, but will not eliminate tire degradation.
Automotive tires have a variety of identifying markings molded onto the sidewall as a tire code.
They denote size, rating, and other information pertinent to that individual tire.
The National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is a U.S. government body within the Department of Transportation (DOT) tasked with regulating automotive safety in the United States.
NHTSA established the Uniform Tire Quality Grading System (UTQG), is a system for comparing the performance of tires according to the Code of Federal Regulations 49 CFR 575.104; it requires labeling of tires for tread wear, traction, and temperature.
The DOT Code is an alphanumeric character sequence molded into the sidewall of the tire and allows the identification of the tire and its age.
The code is mandated by the U.S. Department of Transportation but is used worldwide.
The DOT Code is also useful in identifying tires subject to product recall or at end of life due to age.
The Tire and Rim Association (T&RA) is a voluntary U.S. standards organization that promotes the interchangeability of tires, rims, and allied parts.
Of particular interest, they publish key tire dimensions, rim contour dimensions, tire valve dimension standards, and load/inflation standards.
The National Institute of Metrology Standardization and Industrial Quality (INMETRO) is the Brazilian federal body responsible for automotive wheel and tire certification.
The European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation (ETRTO) is the European standards organization "to establish engineering dimensions, load/pressure characteristics and operating guidelines".
All tires sold for road use in Europe after July 1997 must carry an E-mark.
The mark itself is either an upper case "E" or lower case "e" – followed by a number in a circle or rectangle, followed by a further number.
An (upper case) "E" indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance, and marking requirements of ECE regulation 30.
A (lowercase) "e" indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance, and marking requirements of Directive 92/23/EEC.
The number in the circle or rectangle denotes the country code of the government that granted the type approval.
The last number outside the circle or rectangle is the number of the type approval certificate issued for that particular tire size and type.
The Japanese Automobile Tire Manufacturers Association (JATMA) is the Japanese standards organization for tires, rims, and valves.
It performs similar functions as the T&RA and ETRTO.
The China Compulsory Certification (CCC) is a mandatory certification system concerning product safety in China that went into effect in August 2002.
The CCC certification system is operated by the State General Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China (AQSIQ) and the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People's Republic of China (CNCA).
To maintain tire health, several actions are appropriate, tire rotation, wheel alignment, and, sometimes, retreading the tire.
Rotation— Tires may exhibit irregular wear patterns once installed on a vehicle and partially worn.
Front-wheel drive vehicles tend to wear the front tires at a greater rate compared to the rear tires.
Tire rotation is moving the tires to different car positions, such as front-to-rear, in order to even out the wear, with the objective of extending the life of the tire.
Alignment— Wheel alignment helps prevent wear by having the tire rotate in a direction, other than the path of the vehicle.
When mounted on the vehicle, the wheel and tire may not be perfectly aligned to the direction of travel, and therefore may exhibit irregular wear.
If the discrepancy in alignment is large, then the irregular wear will become substantial if left uncorrected.
Wheel alignment is the procedure for checking and correcting this condition through adjustment of camber, caster, and toe angles.
The adjustment of the angles should be done as per the OEM specifications.
Inflation is key to proper wear and rolling resistance of pneumatic tires.
Many vehicles have monitoring systems to assure proper inflation.
Most passenger cars are advised to maintain a tire pressure within the range of 32 to 35 pounds per square inch (220 to 240 kPa) when the tires are not warmed by driving.
Specification— Vehicle manufacturers provide tire specifications, including a recommended cold inflation pressure, to ensure safe operation within the designated load rating and vehicle loading capacity.
While many tires feature a maximum pressure rating stamped on them, passenger vehicles and light trucks typically include inflation guidance on a decal located just inside the driver's door and in the vehicle owner's handbook.
Ground contact— The tire contact patch is readily changed by both over- and underinflation.
Overinflation may increase the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger.
Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated.
Increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire contact patch is greatly increased.
This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and the tire.
Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and tread separation in severe cases.
Monitoring— Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) are electronic systems that monitor the tire pressures on individual wheels on a vehicle and alert the driver when the pressure goes below a warning limit.
There are several types of designs to monitor tire pressure.
Some actually measure the air pressure, and some make indirect measurements, such as gauging when the relative size of the tire changes due to lower air pressure.
Tire hazards may occur from failure of the tire, itself, or from loss of traction on the surface over which it is rolling.
Structural failures of a tire can result in flat tires or more dangerous blowouts.
Some of these failures can be cause by manufacture error and may lead to recalls, such as the widespread Firestone tire failures on Ford vehicles that lead to the Firestone and Ford tire controversy in the 1990s.
Belt separation which may be belt-to-belt, tread and belt, or separation of the edge of the belt.
Belt-to-belt separation may occur having the tire deflect too much, from high pavement temperatures, road hazard impacts, or other causes that have to do with maintenance and storage.
Non-belt separations include those at the tire tread, in the bead area, in the lower sidewall, between reinforcing plies, and of the reinforcing steel or fabric materials.
Other types of failure include run-flat damage, chemical degradation, cracking, indentations and bulges.
Melting rubber— As tire rubber compounds heat, owing to the friction of stopping, cornering, or accelerating, they may begin to melt, lubricate the tire-road contact area, and become deposited on the pavement.
This effect is stronger with increased ambient temperature.
Hydroplaning— Motor vehicles or aircraft tires passing over a wet pavement may lose contact with sufficient speed or water depth for a given tread design.
In this case, the tire contact area is riding on a film of water and loses the friction needed for braking or cornering and begins to hydroplane (or aquaplane).
Hydroplaning may occur as dynamic hydroplaning where standing water is present with a depth of at least 0.12 inches (3 mm) above the texture of the pavement and speed is sustained above a threshold level.
It may also occur as viscous hydroplaning whereby tire rubber melts for a brief interval and causes slippage.
This may leave deposits of rubber on a runway as airplanes land.
Dynamic hydroplaning causes decreased friction and contact with increased tire speed.
Snow— The degree to which a tire can maintain traction in snow depends on its ability to compact snow, which material then develops strength against slippage along a shear plane parallel to the contact area of the tire on the ground.
At the same time, the bottom of the tire treads compress the snow on which they are bearing, also creating friction.
The process of compacting snow within the treads requires it to be expelled in time for the tread to compact snow anew on the next rotation.
The compaction/contact process works both in the direction of travel for propulsion and braking, but also laterally for cornering.
Ice— Ice is typically close to its melting point when a tire travels over it.
This, combined with a smooth texture, promotes a low coefficient of friction and reduced traction during braking, cornering or acceleration.
Soft ground— Soil can become lubricated with water, which reduces its ability to maintain shear strength when a tire tries to apply force in acceleration, braking, or cornering.
Dry sand also has low shear strength, owing to poor cohesiveness among sand particles.
Tires contain a number of trace toxic chemicals including heavy metals and chemical agents used to increase the durability of the tires.
These typically include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzothiazoles, isoprene and heavy metals such as zinc and lead.
As tires are used for vehicle operations, the natural wear of the tire leaves microfine particles equivalent to PM0.1, PM2.5, and PM10 as tire residue.
This residue accumulates near roadways and vehicle use areas, but also will travel into the environment through surface runoff.
Both humans and animals are exposed to these chemicals at the site of accumulation (i.e. walking on the road surface) and through the accumulation in natural environments and foodchains.
A 2023 literature review from Imperial College London, warned of both the toxic chemicals and microplastics produced from tire wear as having potential widespread serious environmental and health consequences.
Moreover, burning of tires releases these chemicals as air pollutants as well as leaving toxic residues, that can have significant effects on local communities and first responders.
Once tires are discarded, they are considered scrap tires.
Scrap tires are often re-used for things from bumper car barriers to weights to hold down tarps.
Tires are not desired at landfills, due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space.
Rubber tires are likely to contain some traces of heavy metals or other serious pollutants, but these are tightly bonded within the actual rubber compound so they are unlikely to be hazardous unless the tire structure is seriously damaged by fire or strong chemicals.
Some facilities are permitted to recycle scrap tires by chipping and processing them into new products or selling the material to licensed power plants for fuel.
Some tires may also be retreaded for re-use.
Americans generate about 285 million scrap tires per year.
Many states have regulations as to the number of scrap tires that can be held on-site, due to concerns with dumping, fire hazards, and mosquitoes.
In the past, millions of tires have been discarded into open fields.
This creates a breeding ground for mosquitoes, since the tires often hold water inside and remain warm enough for mosquito breeding.
Mosquitoes create a nuisance and may increase the likelihood of spreading disease.
It also creates a fire danger, since such a large tire pile is a lot of fuel.
Some tire fires have burned for months, since water does not adequately penetrate or cool the burning tires.
Tires have been known to liquefy, releasing hydrocarbons and other contaminants to the ground and even groundwater, under extreme heat and temperatures from a fire.
The black smoke from a tire fire causes air pollution and is a hazard to downwind properties.
The use of scrap tire chips for landscaping has become controversial, due to the leaching of metals and other contaminants from the tire pieces.
Zinc is concentrated (up to 2% by weight) to levels high enough to be highly toxic to aquatic life and plants.
Of particular concern is evidence that some of the compounds that leach from tires into the water contain hormone disruptors and cause liver lesions.
Tires are a major source of microplastic pollution.
Tires that are fully worn can be retreaded, re-manufactured to replace the worn tread.
This is known as retreading or recapping, a process of buffing away the worn tread and applying a new tread.
There are two main processes used for retreading tires, called mold-cure and pre-cure methods.
Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as shearography to locate non-visible damage and embedded debris and nails.
Some casings are repaired and some are discarded.
Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition.
Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires over the life of the tire body.
Casings fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.
During the retreading process, retread technicians must ensure the casing is in the best condition possible to minimize the possibility of a casing failure.
Casings with problems such as capped tread, tread separation, irreparable cuts, corroded belts or sidewall damage, or any run-flat or skidded tires, will be rejected.
The mold cure method involves the application of raw rubber on the previously buffed and prepared casing, which is later cured in matrices.
During the curing period, vulcanization takes place, and the raw rubber bonds to the casing, taking the tread shape of the matrix.
On the other hand, the pre-cure method involves the application of a ready-made tread band on the buffed and prepared casing, which later is cured in an autoclave so that vulcanization can occur.
Tires can be recycled into, among other things, the hot melt asphalt, typically as crumb rubber modifier—recycled asphalt pavement (CRM—RAP), and as an aggregate in portland cement concrete.
Shredded tires can create rubber mulch on playgrounds to diminish fall injuries.
There are some "green" buildings that are being made both private and public buildings that are made from old tires.
The tire pyrolysis method for recycling used tires is a technique that heats whole or shredded tires in a reactor vessel containing an oxygen-free atmosphere and a heat source.
In the reactor, the rubber is softened after which the rubber polymers continuously break down into smaller molecules.
Building elements — Tires filled with earth have been used as garden containers house foundations, bullet-proof walls and to prevent soil erosion in flood plains.
Tire walls are a common feature of motor racing circuits for safety.
Recreational equipment — Used tires are employed as exercise equipment for athletic programs such as American football.
One classic conditioning drill that hones players' speed and agility is the "Tire Run" where tires are laid out side by side, with each tire on the left a few inches ahead of the tire on the right in a zigzag pattern.
Athletes then run through the tire pattern by stepping in the center of each tire.
The drill forces athletes to lift their feet above the ground higher than normal to avoid tripping on the tires.
Old tires are sometimes converted into a swing for play.
Burning tires as protest — Protestors, worldwide, have burned tires to create black smoke.
A transfer case is an intermediate gearbox that transfers power from the transmission of a motor vehicle to the driven axles of four-wheel-drive, all-wheel-drive, and other multi-axled on- and off-road machines.
A part of the vehicle's drivetrain, it employs drive shafts to mechanically deliver motive power.
The transfer case  also synchronizes the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels (only high-speed 4wd-Awd systems), and may contain one or more sets of low range gears for off-road use.
A transfer case that allows alternating between 2-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive modes but lacks a center differential for coordinating axle speeds is known as "part-time".
Some vehicles, such as all-wheel-drive (AWD) sports cars, have transfer cases that are not selectable, known as "full-time".
Such a transfer case is permanently "locked" into AWD mode.
In recent decades hybrids have been developed that share properties of each.
The transfer case may contain one or more sets of low range gears for off-road use.
Low range gears are engaged with a shifter or electronic switch.
In many transfer cases, this shifter is the same as the one that selects 2WD or 4WD operation.
Low range gears allow the vehicle to drive at much slower speeds while still operating within the usable power band / RPM range of the engine.
This also increases the torque available at the axles.
Low-range gears are used for very inclement road conditions, towing a heavy load slowly, driving on rough, unimproved roads slowly, and extreme off-road maneuvers such as rockcrawling.
This feature is often absent on all-wheel-drive cars.
Some very large vehicles, such as heavy equipment or military trucks, may have more than one set of low-range gears.
The transfer case may require stopping entirely to engage four-wheel drive (or just low-range 4WD), slowing to a designated speed to engage or disengage an extra axle, or may permit full "shift-on-the-fly" engagement of high-range 4WD at any speed.
Transfer cases that are designed to allow for normal road use synchronize the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels, in much the same way the differential acts on a given axle.
This is necessary because the front and rear tires never turn at the same speed.
Different rates of tire rotation are generally due to different tire diameters (since the front and rear tires inevitably wear at different rates) and different gear ratios in the front and rear differentials since manufacturers will often have a slightly lower ratio in the front vs. the rear to help with control (such as a 3.55:1 in the rear differential and a 3.54:1 in the front differential).
If the transfer case did not make up the difference between the two different rates of rotation, binding would occur and the transfer case could become damaged.
This is also why a transfer case that is not designed for on-road use will cause problems with driveline windup if driven on dry pavement.
Most traditional transfer cases designed for off-road include the ability to mechanically lock the front and rear drive shafts to evenly distribute engine torque between them.
This is similar to the differential lock's ability to force both wheels of an axle to turn simultaneously by locking them together, only between axles instead of wheels.
A part-/full-time hybrid transfer case enables a vehicle to operate in two-wheel drive, full-time four-wheel drive (with the center differential open) and part-time four-wheel drive (with the center diff locked) in both high- and low-ranges.
Transfer cases used on "part-time" four-wheel-drive off-road vehicles such as trucks and some specialty military vehicles generally allow the driver to select 2WD or 4WD, as well as high or low gear ranges.
Automated versions used in sports cars and performance sedans are usually "transparent" to the driver; there is no shifter or select lever.
There are two different types of internal power-transfer mechanisms found in most transfer cases.
Gear-driven transfer cases use sets of gears to drive either the front or both the front and rear driveshafts.
These are generally strong, heavy units that are used in large trucks, but there are currently several gear drive cases in production for passenger cars.
Chain-driven transfer cases use a chain to drive most often only one axle but can drive both axles.
Chain-driven transfer cases are quieter and lighter than gear-driven ones.
They are used in vehicles such as compact trucks, full-size trucks, Jeeps, and SUVs.
Some off-road driving enthusiasts modify their vehicles to use gear-driven transfer cases, accepting the additional weight and noise to gain the extra strength they generally provide.
Transfer cases are also classified as either "divorced"/independent or "married".
Married transfer cases are bolted directly to the transmission, usually between the transmission's output shaft and the rear or main driveshaft.
Sometimes a married transfer case is an integral part of the transmission and the two components share the same housing or "case", as is commonly found on recent Subaru products and some other all-wheel-drive cars.
A divorced or independent transfer case is completely separate from the transmission.
It is located further down the driveline than a married transfer case and connected to the transmission output shaft by a short driveshaft.
Independent transfer cases are used on very long wheelbase vehicles, such as commercial trucks or military trucks.
This setup is also optimal for modified 4x4 because it's easier to change engine and transmissions, preserving the original 4WD system.
M.S.O.F. Manual Shift On-the-Fly transfer cases have a selector lever on the driver's side floor transmission hump and may also have either two sealed automatic front axle locking hubs or two manual front axle hub selectors of "LOCK" and "UNLOCK" or "FREE".
To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a low speed.
The speed at which 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle.
This is only for the four-wheel-drive high setting.
To engage the four-wheel-drive low setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.
E.S.O.F. Electronic Shift On-the-Fly (ESOF) transfer cases have a dash-mounted selector switch or buttons with front sealed automatic locking axle hubs or drive flanges.
Unlike the manual transfer case, this system has a transfer case motor.
To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a lower speed.
The speed at which 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle.
This is only for the four-wheel-drive high setting.
To engage the four-wheel-drive low setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.
Traffic congestion is a condition in transport that is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing.
Traffic congestion on urban road networks has increased substantially since the 1950s.
When traffic demand is great enough that the interaction between vehicles slows the traffic stream, this results in congestion.
While congestion is a possibility for any mode of transportation, this article will focus on automobile congestion on public roads.
As demand approaches the capacity of a road (or of the intersections along the road), extreme traffic congestion sets in.
When vehicles are fully stopped for periods of time, this is  known as a traffic jam or (informally) a traffic snarl-up or a tailback.
Drivers can become frustrated and engage in road rage.
Drivers and driver-focused road planning departments commonly propose to alleviate congestion by adding another lane to the road.
This is ineffective: increasing road capacity induces more demand for driving.
Mathematically, traffic is modeled as a flow through a fixed point on the route, analogously to fluid dynamics.
Traffic congestion occurs when a volume of traffic generates demand for space greater than the available street capacity; this point is commonly termed saturation.
Several specific circumstances can cause or aggravate congestion; most of them reduce the capacity of a road at a given point or over a certain length, or increase the number of vehicles required for a given volume of people or goods.
About half of U.S. traffic congestion is recurring, and is attributed to sheer weight of traffic; most of the rest is attributed to traffic incidents, road work and weather events.
In terms of traffic operation, rainfall reduces traffic capacity and operating speeds, thereby resulting in greater congestion and road network productivity loss.
Individual incidents such as crashes or even a single car braking heavily in a previously smooth flow may cause ripple effects, a cascading failure, which then spread out and create a sustained traffic jam when, otherwise, the normal flow might have continued for some time longer.
People often work and live in different parts of the city.
Many workplaces are located in a central business district away from residential areas, resulting in workers commuting.
According to a 2011 report published by the United States Census Bureau, a total of 132.3 million people in the United States commute between their work and residential areas daily.
People may need to move about within the city to obtain goods and services, for instance to purchase goods or attend classes in a different part of the city.
Brussels, a Belgian city with a strong service economy, has one of the worst traffic congestion in the world, wasting 74 hours in traffic in 2014.
Some traffic engineers have attempted to apply the rules of fluid dynamics to traffic flow,  likening it to the flow of a fluid in a pipe.
Congestion simulations and real-time observations have shown that in heavy but free flowing traffic, jams can arise spontaneously, triggered by minor events ("butterfly effects"), such as an abrupt steering maneuver by a single motorist.
Traffic scientists liken such a situation to the sudden freezing of supercooled fluid.
However, unlike a fluid, traffic flow is often affected by signals or other events at junctions that periodically affect the smooth flow of traffic.
Alternative mathematical theories exist, such as Boris Kerner's three-phase traffic theory (see also spatiotemporal reconstruction of traffic congestion).
Because of the poor correlation of theoretical models to actual observed traffic flows, transportation planners and highway engineers attempt to forecast traffic flow using empirical models.
Their working traffic models typically use a combination of macro-, micro- and mesoscopic features, and may add matrix entropy effects, by "platooning" groups of vehicles and by randomizing the flow patterns within individual segments of the network.
These models are then typically calibrated by measuring actual traffic flows on the links in the network, and the baseline flows are adjusted accordingly.
A team of MIT mathematicians has developed a model that describes the formation of "phantom jams", in which small disturbances (a driver hitting the brake too hard, or getting too close to another car) in heavy traffic can become amplified into a full-blown, self-sustaining traffic jam.
Key to the study is the realization that the mathematics of such jams, which the researchers call "jamitons", are strikingly similar to the equations that describe detonation waves produced by explosions, says Aslan Kasimov, lecturer in MIT's Department of Mathematics.
That discovery enabled the team to solve traffic-jam equations that were first theorized in the 1950s.
Congested roads can be seen as an example of the tragedy of the commons.
Because roads in most places are free at the point of usage, there is little financial incentive for drivers not to over-use them, up to the point where traffic collapses into a jam, when demand becomes limited by opportunity cost.
Privatization of highways and road pricing have both been proposed as measures that may reduce congestion through economic incentives and disincentives .
Congestion can also happen due to non-recurring highway incidents, such as a crash or roadworks, which may reduce the road's capacity below normal levels.
Economist Anthony Downs argues that rush hour traffic congestion is inevitable because of the benefits of having a relatively standard work day .
In a capitalist economy, goods can be allocated either by pricing (ability to pay) or by queueing (first-come first-served); congestion is an example of the latter.
Instead of the traditional solution of making the "pipe" large enough to accommodate the total demand for peak-hour vehicle travel (a supply-side solution), either by widening roadways or increasing "flow pressure" via automated highway systems, Downs advocates greater use of road pricing to reduce congestion (a demand-side solution, effectively rationing demand), in turn plowing the revenues generated therefrom into public transportation projects.
A 2011 study in The American Economic Review indicates that there may be a "fundamental law of road congestion."
The researchers, from the  University of Toronto and the London School of Economics, analyzed data from the U.S. Highway Performance and Monitoring System for 1983, 1993 and 2003, as well as information on population, employment, geography, transit, and political factors.
They determined that the number of vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) increases in direct proportion to the available lane-kilometers of roadways.
The implication is that building new roads and widening existing ones only results in additional traffic that continues to rise until peak congestion returns to the previous level.
Qualitative classification of traffic is often done in the form of a six-letter A-F level of service (LOS) scale defined in the Highway Capacity Manual, a US document used (or used as a basis for national guidelines) worldwide.
These levels are used by transportation engineers as a shorthand and to describe traffic levels to the lay public.
While this system generally uses delay as the basis for its measurements, the particular measurements and statistical methods vary depending on the facility being described.
For instance, while the percent time spent following a slower-moving vehicle figures into the LOS for a rural two-lane road, the LOS at an urban intersection incorporates such measurements as the number of drivers forced to wait through more than one signal cycle.
Traffic congestion occurs in time and space, i.e., it is a spatiotemporal process.
Therefore, another classification schema of traffic congestion is associated with some common spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion found in measured traffic data.
Common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion are those features, which are qualitatively the same for different highways in different countries measured during years of traffic observations.
Common features of traffic congestion are independent on weather, road conditions and road infrastructure, vehicular technology, driver characteristics, day time, etc.
Examples of common features of traffic congestion are the features [J] and [S] for, respectively, the wide moving jam and synchronized flow traffic phases found in Kerner's three-phase traffic theory.
The common features of traffic congestion can be reconstructed in space and time with the use of the ASDA and FOTO models.
Wasting time of motorists and passengers ("opportunity cost").
As a non-productive activity for most people, congestion reduces regional economic health.
Delays, which may result in late arrival for employment, meetings, and education, resulting in lost business, disciplinary action or other personal losses.
Inability to forecast travel time accurately, leading to drivers allocating more time to travel "just in case", and less time on productive activities.
Wasted fuel increasing air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions owing to increased idling, acceleration and braking.
Wear and tear on vehicles as a result of idling in traffic and frequent acceleration and braking, leading to more frequent repairs and replacements.
Emergencies: blocked traffic may interfere with the passage of emergency vehicles traveling to their destinations where they are urgently needed.
Spillover effect from congested main arteries to secondary roads and side streets as alternative routes are attempted ('rat running'), which may affect neighborhood amenity and real estate prices.
Higher chance of collisions due to tight spacing and constant stopping-and-going.
Road rage is aggressive or angry behavior by a driver of an automobile or other motor vehicle.
Such behavior might include rude gestures, verbal insults, deliberately driving in an unsafe or threatening manner, or making threats.
Road rage can lead to altercations, assaults, and collisions which result in injuries and even deaths.
It can be thought of as an extreme case of aggressive driving.
The term originated in the United States in 1987–1988 (specifically, from Newscasters at KTLA, a local television station), when a rash of freeway shootings occurred on the 405, 110 and 10 freeways in Los Angeles, California.
These shooting sprees even spawned a response from the AAA Motor Club to its members on how to respond to drivers with road rage or aggressive maneuvers and gestures.
Congestion has the benefit of encouraging motorists to retime their trips so that expensive road space is in full use for more hours per day.
It may also encourage travellers to pick alternate modes with a lower environmental impact, such as public transport or bicycles.
It has been argued that traffic congestion, by reducing road speeds in cities, could reduce the frequency and severity of road crashes.
More recent research suggests that a U-curve exists between the number of accidents and the flow of traffic, implying that more accidents happen not only at high congestion levels, but also when there are very few vehicles on the road.
City planning and urban design practices can have a huge impact on levels of future traffic congestion, though they are of limited relevance for short-term change.
Grid plans including fused grid road network geometry, rather than tree-like network topology which branches into cul-de-sacs (which reduce local traffic, but increase total distances driven and discourage walking by reducing connectivity).
This avoids concentration of traffic on a small number of arterial roads and allows more trips to be made without a car.
Zoning laws that encourage mixed-use development, which reduces distances between residential, commercial, retail, and recreational destinations and encourage cycling and walking.
Cycling modal share is strongly associated with the availability of local cycling infrastructure.
Carfree cities, car-light cities, and eco-cities designed to eliminate the need to travel by car for most inhabitants.
Transit-oriented development are residential and commercial areas designed to maximize access to public transport by providing a transit station or stop (train station, metro station, tram stop, or bus stop).
Congestion can be reduced by either increasing road capacity (supply), or by reducing traffic (demand).
Capacity can be increased in a number of ways, but needs to take account of latent demand otherwise it may be used more strongly than anticipated.
Critics of the approach of adding capacity have compared it to "fighting obesity by letting out your belt" (inducing demand that did not exist before).
For example, when new lanes are created, households with a second car that used to be parked most of the time may begin to use this second car for commuting.
Reducing road capacity has in turn been attacked as removing free choice as well as increasing travel costs and times, placing an especially high burden on the low income residents who must commute to work.
Parking restrictions, making motor vehicle use less attractive by increasing the monetary and non-monetary costs of parking, introducing greater competition for limited city or road space.
Most transport planning experts agree that free parking distorts the market in favor of car travel, exacerbating congestion.
Park and ride facilities allowing parking at a distance and allowing continuation by public transport or ride sharing.
Park-and-ride car parks are commonly found at metro stations,  freeway entrances in suburban areas, and at the edge of smaller cities.
Reduction of road capacity to force traffic onto other travel modes.
Methods include traffic calming and the shared space concept.
"Cap and trade", in which only licensed cars are allowed on the roads.
A limited quota of car licenses are issued each year and traded in a free market fashion.
This guarantees that the number of cars does not exceed road capacity while avoiding the negative effects of shortages normally associated with quotas.
However, since demand for cars tends to be inelastic, the result are exorbitant purchase prices for the licenses, pricing out the lower levels of society, as seen Singapore's Certificate of Entitlement scheme.
Road space rationing, where regulatory restrictions prevent certain types of vehicles from driving under certain circumstances or in certain areas.
Number plate restrictions based on days of the week, as practiced in several large cities in the world, such as Athens, Mexico City, Manila and São Paulo.
In effect, such cities are banning a different part of the automobile fleet from roads each day of the week.
Mainly introduced to combat smog, these measures also reduce congestion.
A weakness of this method is that richer drivers can purchase a second or third car to circumvent the ban.
Permits, where only certain types of vehicles (such as residents) are permitted to enter a certain area, and other types (such as through-traffic) are banned.
For example, Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, has proposed to impose a complete ban on motor vehicles in the city's inner districts, with exemptions only for residents, businesses, and the disabled.
Policy approaches, which usually attempt to provide either strategic alternatives or which encourage greater usage of existing alternatives through promotion, subsidies or restrictions.
Incentives to use public transport, increasing modal shares.
This can be achieved through infrastructure investment, subsidies, transport integration, pricing strategies that decrease the marginal cost/fixed cost ratios, improved timetabling and greater priority for buses to reduce journey time e.g. bus lanes or bus rapid transit .
Cycling promotion through legislation, cycle facilities, subsidies, and awareness campaigns.
The Netherlands has been pursuing cycle friendly policies for decades, and around a quarter of their commuting is done by bicycle.
Promotion of more flexible work place practices.
For example, a flexible workplaces pilot was undertaken in Brisbane, Australia during 2009 to test the applicability of a voluntary travel behavior change program to achieve transport system outcomes, particularly as they related to managing congestion, either through mode shift or peak spreading.
During the one-month Pilot, amongst almost 900 Brisbane CBD workers across 20 private and public sector organizations, shifts of more than 30% out of the morning and afternoon peak travel was recorded.
Remote work encouraged through legislation and subsidies.
Online shopping promotion, potentially with automated delivery booths helping to solve the last mile problem and reduce shopping trips made by car.
Active traffic management system opens up UK motorway hard shoulder as an extra traffic lane; it uses CCTV and VMS to control and monitor the traffic's use of the extra lane.
School opening times arranged to avoid rush hour traffic (in some countries, private car school pickup and drop-off traffic are substantial percentages of peak hour traffic).
Considerate driving behavior promotion and enforcement.
Driving practices such as tailgating, frequent lane changes, and impeding the flow of traffic can reduce a road's capacity and exacerbate jams.
In some countries signs are placed on highways to raise awareness, while others have introduced legislation against inconsiderate driving.
Speed limit reductions, as practiced on the M25 motorway in London.
With lower speeds allowing cars to drive closer together, this increases the capacity of a road.
Note that this measure is only effective if the interval between cars is reduced, not the distance itself.
Low intervals are generally only safe at low speeds.
Lane splitting/filtering, in which some jurisdictions allow motorcycles, scooters and bicycles to travel in the space between cars, buses, and trucks.
Reduction of road freight avoiding problems such as double parking with innovative solutions including cargo bicycles and Gothenburg's Stadsleveransens.
Traffic during peak hours in major Australian cities, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, is usually very congested and can cause considerable delay for motorists.
Australians rely mainly on radio and television to obtain current traffic information.
GPS, webcams, and online resources are increasingly being used to monitor and relay traffic conditions to motorists.
Traffic jams have become intolerable in Dhaka.
Some other major reasons are the total absence of a rapid transit system; the lack of an integrated urban planning scheme for over 30 years; poorly maintained road surfaces, with potholes rapidly eroded further by frequent flooding and poor or non-existent drainage; haphazard stopping and parking; poor driving standards; total lack of alternative routes, with several narrow and (nominally) one-way roads.
According to Time magazine, São Paulo has the world's worst daily traffic jams.
Based on reports from the Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego, the city's traffic management agency, the historical congestion record was set on May 23, 2014, with 344 kilometres (214 mi) of cumulative queues around the city during the evening rush hour.
The previous record occurred on November 14, 2013, with 309 kilometres (192 mi) of cumulative queues.
Despite implementation since 1997 of road space rationing by the last digit of the plate number during rush hours every weekday, traffic in this 20-million-strong city still experiences severe congestion.
According to experts, this is due to the accelerated rate of motorization occurring since 2003 and the limited capacity of public transport.
In São Paulo, traffic is growing at a rate of 7.5% per year, with almost 1,000 new cars bought in the city every day.
The subway has only 61 kilometres (38 mi) of lines, though 35 further kilometers are under construction or planned by 2010.
Every day, many citizens spend between three up to four hours behind the wheel.
In order to mitigate the aggravating congestion problem, since June 30, 2008, the road space rationing program was expanded to include and restrict trucks and light commercial vehicles.
According to the Toronto Board of Trade, in 2010, Toronto is ranked as the most congested city of 19 surveyed cities, with an average commute time of 80 minutes.
The Chinese city of Beijing started a license plate rationing since the 2008 Summer Olympics whereby each car is banned from the urban core one workday per week, depending on the last digit of its license plate.
As of 2016, 11 major Chinese cities have implemented similar policies.
Towards the end of 2010, Beijing announced a series of drastic measures to tackle the city's chronic traffic congestion, such as limiting the number of new plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month, barring vehicles with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hours and expanding its subway system.
The government aims to cap the number of locally registered cars in Beijing to below 6.3 million by the end of 2020.
In addition, more than nine major Chinese cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou started limiting the number of new plates issued to passenger cars in an attempt to curb the growth of car ownership.
In response to the increased demand to public transit caused by these policies, aggressive programs to rapidly expand public transport systems in many Chinese cities are currently underway.
A unique Chinese phenomenon of severe traffic congestion occurs during Chunyun Period or Spring Festival travel season.
It is a long-held tradition for most Chinese people to reunite with their families during Chinese New Year.
People return to their hometown to have a reunion dinner with their families on Chinese New Year.
It has been described as the largest annual human migration in the world.
Since the economic boom and rapid urbanization of China since the late 1970s, many people work and study a considerable distance from their hometowns.
Traffic flow is typically directional, with large amounts of the population working in more developed coastal provinces needing travel to their hometowns in the less developed interior.
The process reverses near the end of Chunyun.
With almost 3 billion trips made in 40 days of the 2016 Chunyun Period, the Chinese intercity transportation network is extremely strained during this period.
The August 2010 China National Highway 110 traffic jam in Hebei province caught media attention for its severity, stretching more than 100 kilometres (62 mi) from August 14 to 26, including at least 11 days of total gridlock.
The event was caused by a combination of road works and thousands of coal trucks from Inner Mongolia's coalfields that travel daily to Beijing.
The New York Times has called this event the "Great Chinese Gridlock of 2010."
The congestion is regarded as the worst in history by duration, and is one of the longest in length after the 175 kilometres (109 mi) long Lyon-Paris traffic jam in France on February 16, 1980.
Recently, in Hangzhou City Brain has become active, reducing traffic congestion somewhat.
A 2021 study of subway constructions in China found that in the first year of a new subway line, road congestion declined.
Since the 70s, the traffic on the streets of Athens has increased dramatically, with the existing road network unable to serve the ever-increasing demand.
In addition, it has also caused an environmental burden, such as the photochemical smog.
To deal with it, the Daktylios has been enforced.
The number of vehicles in India is quickly increasing as a growing middle class can now afford to buy cars.
India's road conditions have not kept up with the exponential growth in number of vehicles.
According to a 2015 study by motor oil company Castrol, Jakarta is found to be the worst city in the world for traffic congestion.
Relying on information from TomTom navigation devices in 78 countries, the index found that drivers are stopping and starting their cars 33,240 times per year on the road.
After Jakarta, the worst cities for traffic are Istanbul, Mexico City, Surabaya, and St. Petersburg.
Daily congestion in Jakarta is not a recent problem.
The expansion of commercial area without road expansion shows worsening daily congestion even in main roads such as Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, Jalan M.H. Thamrin, and Jalan Gajah Mada in the mid-1970s.
In 2016, 22 people died as a result of traffic congestion in Java.
They were among those stuck in a three-day traffic jam at a toll exit in Brebes, Central Java called Brebes Exit or 'Brexit'.
The traffic block stretched for 21 km here and thousands of cars clogged the highway.
Many people died because of carbon monoxide poisoning, fatigue or heat.
New Zealand has followed strongly car-oriented transport policies since after World War II (especially in Auckland, where one third of the country's population lives, is New Zealand's most traffic congested city, and has been labeled worse than New York for traffic congestion with commuters sitting in traffic congestion for 95 hours per year), and currently has one of the highest car-ownership rates per capita in the world, after the United States.
Traffic congestion in New Zealand is increasing with drivers on New Zealand's motorways reported to be struggling to exceed 20 km/h on an average commute, sometimes crawling along at 8 km/h for more than half an hour.
According to a survey by Waze, traffic congestion in Metro Manila is called the "worst" in the world, after Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Jakarta.
It is worsened by violations of traffic laws, like illegal parking, loading and unloading, beating the red light, and wrong-way driving.
Traffic congestion in Metro Manila is caused by the large number of registered vehicles, lack of roads, and overpopulation, especially in the cities of Manila and Caloocan, as well as the municipality of Pateros.
Traffic caused losses of ₱137,500,000,000 on the economy in 2011, and unbuilt roads and railway projects also causes worsening congestion.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) feared that daily economic losses will reach Php 6,000,000,000 by 2030 if traffic congestion cannot be controlled.
In recent years, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has made huge investments on intelligent transportation systems and public transportation.
Despite that, traffic is a significant problem in Istanbul.
Istanbul has chosen the second most congested and the most sudden-stopping traffic in the world.
Travel times in Turkey's largest city take on average 55 percent longer than they should, even in relatively less busy hours.
Even when everything that it is possibly to do by way of building new roads and expanding public transport has been done, there would still be, in the absence of deliberate limitation, more cars trying to move into, or within our cities than could possibly be accommodated.
The Department for Transport sees growing congestion as one of the most serious transport problems facing the UK.
On December 1, 2006, Rod Eddington published a UK government-sponsored report into the future of Britain's transport infrastructure.
The Eddington Transport Study set out the case for action to improve road and rail networks, as a "crucial enabler of sustained productivity and competitiveness".
Eddington has estimated that congestion may cost the economy of England £22 bn a year in lost time by 2025.
He warned that roads were in serious danger of becoming so congested that the economy would suffer.
At the launch of the report Eddington told journalists and transport industry representatives introducing road pricing to encourage drivers to drive less was an "economic no-brainer".
There was, he said "no attractive alternative".
It would allegedly cut congestion by half by 2025, and bring benefits to the British economy totaling £28 bn a year.
A congestion charge for driving in central London was introduced in 2003.
In 2013, ten years later, Transport for London reported that the scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometers in London.
Despite these gains, traffic speeds in central London became progressively slower.
The Texas Transportation Institute estimated that, in 2000, the 75 largest metropolitan areas experienced 3.6 billion vehicle-hours of delay, resulting in 5.7 billion U.S. gallons (21.6 billion liters) in wasted fuel and $67.5 billion in lost productivity, or about 0.7% of the nation's GDP.
It also estimated that the annual cost of congestion for each driver was approximately $1,000 in very large cities and $200 in small cities.
Traffic congestion is increasing in major cities and delays are becoming more frequent in smaller cities and rural areas.
30% of traffic is cars looking for parking.
The most congested highway in the United States, according to a 2010 study of freight congestion (truck speed and travel time), is Chicago's Interstate 290 at the Circle Interchange.
The average truck speed was just 29 mph (47 km/h).
A transmission control unit (TCU), also known as a transmission control module (TCM), or a gearbox control unit (GCU), is a type of automotive ECU that is used to control electronic automatic transmissions.
Similar systems are used in conjunction with various semi-automatic transmissions, purely for clutch automation and actuation.
A TCU in a modern automatic transmission generally uses sensors from the vehicle, as well as data provided by the engine control unit (ECU), to calculate how and when to change gears in the vehicle for optimum performance, fuel economy and shift quality.
Electronic automatic transmissions have been changing in design from purely hydromechanical controls to electronic controls since the late 1980s.
Since then, development has been iterative and today designs exist from several stages of electronic automatic transmission control development.
Transmission solenoids are a key component to these control units.
The evolution of modern automatic transmission and the integration of electronic controls have allowed great progress in recent years.
The modern automatic transmission is now able to achieve better fuel economy, reduced engine emissions, greater shift system reliability, improved shift feel, improved shift speed and improved vehicle handling.
The immense range of programmability offered by a TCU allows the modern automatic transmission to be used with appropriate transmission characteristics for each application.
On some applications, the TCU and the ECU are combined into a single unit as a powertrain control module (PCM).
This sensor sends a varying frequency signal to the TCU to determine the current speed of the vehicle.
The TCU uses this information to determine when a gear change should take place based in the various operating parameters.
The TCU also uses a ratio between the turbine speed sensor (TSS) and wheel speed sensor (WSS) which is used to determine when to change gears.
If either the TSS or WSS fails or malfunctions/becomes faulty, the ratio will be wrong which in return can cause problems like false speedometer readings and transmission slipping.
To test these parts, check the resistance to make sure it's within manufacturer specs.
Modern automatic transmissions also have a wheel speed sensor input to determine the true speed of the vehicle to determine whether the vehicle is going downhill or uphill and also adapt gear changes according to road speeds, and also whether to decouple the torque converter at a standstill to improve fuel consumption and reduce load on running gear.
The TPS sensor along with the vehicle speed sensor are the two main inputs for most TCUs.
Older transmissions use this to determine engine load, with the introduction of drive-by-wire technology, this is often a shared input between the ECU and TCU.
The input is used to determine the optimum time and characteristics for a gear change according to load on the engine.
The rate of change is used to determine whether a downshift is appropriate for overtaking, for example, the value of the TPS is also continually monitored during the journey and shift programmes are changed accordingly (economy, sport mode, etc.).
The TCU can also reference this information with the vehicle speed sensor to determine vehicle acceleration and compare this with a nominal value; if the actual value is much higher or lower (such as driving uphill or towing a trailer) the transmission will change its gearshift patterns to suit the situation.
Known as an input speed sensor (ISS).
This sensor sends a varying frequency signal to the TCU to determine the current rotational speed of the input shaft or torque converter.
The TCU uses the input shaft speed to determine slippage across the torque converter and potentially to determine the rate of slippage across the bands and clutches.
This information is vital to regulate the application of the torque converter lock-up clutch smoothly and effectively.
This may also be known as Transmission Oil Temperature.
This sensor determines the fluid temperature inside the transmission.
This is often used for diagnostic purposes to check ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) at the correct temperature.
The main use of this has been as a failsafe feature to downshift the transmission if the ATF becomes extremely hot.
On more modern transmissions this input allows the TCU to modify the line pressure and solenoid pressures according to the changing viscosity of the fluid based on temperature in order to improve shift comfort, and also to determine regulation of the torque converter lock-up clutch.
One of the most common inputs into a TCU is the kick down switch which is used to determine if the accelerator pedal has been depressed past full throttle.
Traditionally this was required on older transmissions with a simple logic in order to ensure maximum acceleration.
When activated the transmission downshifts into the lowest permissible gear based on current road speed to use the full power reserves of the engine.
This is still present in most transmissions though is no longer necessary to use in most circumstances because the TCU uses the throttle position sensor, the rate of change, and driver characteristics to determine whether a downshift may be necessary, thus eliminating the traditional need for this switch.
This input is used to determine whether to activate the shift lock solenoid to prevent the driver from selecting a driving range with no foot on the brake.
In more modern TCUs this input is also used to determine whether to downshift the transmission to increase engine braking effect if the transmission detects that the vehicle is going downhill.
Many TCUs now have an input from the vehicle's traction control system.
If the TCS detects unfavourable road conditions, a signal is sent to the TCU.
The TCU can modify shift programmes by upshifting early, eliminating the torque converter lock-up clutch application, and also eliminating the first gear totally and pulling off in 2nd.
These simple on/off electric switches detect the presence or absence of fluid pressure in a particular hydraulic line.
They are used for diagnostic purposes and in some cases for controlling the application or release of hydraulic control elements.
If the vehicle is fitted with cruise control the TCU may also have a connection to cruise control system.
This can modify shift behaviour to take into account the throttle is not being operated by the driver to eliminate unexpected gearchanges when the cruise control is engaged.
This is also used to inform the cruise control system about the position of the selector lever so that the cruise control can be deactivated if the lever is shifted out of a driving range.
A wide variety of information is delivered to the TCU via Controller Area Network communications or similar protocols (such as Chrysler's CCD bus, an early EIA-485-based vehicle local area network).
In older vehicle designs, as well as in aftermarket TCUs sold into the racing and hobbyist markets, the TCU receives only the signals needed to control the transmission (engine speed, vehicle speed, throttle position or manifold vacuum, shift lever position).
The typical modern TCU sends out signals to shift solenoids, pressure control solenoids, torque converter lockup solenoids and to other electronic controllers.
Many automatic transmissions lock the selector lever via a shiftlock solenoid to stop a driving range being selected if the brake pedal is not depressed.
Modern electronic automatic transmissions have electrical solenoids which are activated to change gears.
Simple electronic-control designs (such as Ford's AOD-E, AXOD-E and E4OD) use the solenoids to modify the shift points in an existing valve body, while more advanced designs (such as the Chrysler Ultradrive and its follow-ons) use the solenoids to control the clutches indirectly, by way of a greatly simplified valve body.
Modern electronic automatic transmissions are still fundamentally hydraulic.
This requires precise pressure control.
Older automatic transmission designs only use a single line pressure control solenoid which modifies pressure across the entire transmission.
Newer automatic transmission designs often use many pressure control solenoids, and sometimes allow the shift solenoids themselves to provide precise pressure control during shifts by ramping the solenoid on and off.
The shift pressure affects the shift quality (too high a pressure will result in rough shifting; too low a pressure will cause the clutches to overheat) and shift speed.
Most electronic automatic transmissions utilize a TCC solenoid to regulate the torque converter electronically.
Once fully locked, the torque converter no longer applies torque multiplication and will spin at the same speed as the engine.
This provides a major increase in fuel economy.
Modern designs provide partial lockup in lower gears to improve fuel economy further, but this can increase wear on the clutch components.
Many TCUs provide an output to the ECU to retard the ignition timing, or reduce the fuel quantity, for a few milliseconds to reduce load on the transmission during heavy throttle.
This allows automatic transmissions to shift smoothly even on engines with large amounts of torque which would otherwise result in a harder shift and possible damage to the gearbox.
The TCU provides information about the health of the transmission, such as clutch wear indicators and shift pressures, and can raise trouble codes and set the malfunction indicator lamp on the instrument cluster if a serious problem is found.
An output to the cruise control module is also often present to deactivate the cruise control if a neutral gear is selected, just like on a manual transmission.
The transmission control unit (TCU) in older automobiles with a clutchless manual transmission (without a clutch pedal) typically consists of an electrical switch connected to the gearshift, that is activated whenever the internal transmission control unit senses driver touching the gearshift to switch gears, which then primes a sensor or solenoid to impel a clutch servo, and in turn, disengages the clutch actuator so the driver can change gears.
The internal clutch actuator in a semi-automatic transmission can be powered by either hydraulic, pneumatic, or electric means.
Later examples of clutchless manual transmissions used in road cars include the Saab Sensonic transmission, used in the 900 NG, and the Ferrari Valeo auto-manual transmission, used in the Mondial T. Both systems used a computer-controlled ECU or microprocessor, connected to a sensor embedded in the gearshift, that would detect when the driver was going to change gear (i.e., by touching the gearshift), and would actuate the clutch automatically, allowing the driver to change gear.
Saab's Sensonic system was electro-hydraulic, using an electric motor or solenoid connected to a hydraulic clutch actuator, whereas Ferrari's Valeo system was electro-mechanical, using an electric motor or solenoid, connected to the mechanical clutch system.
Similar TCU or GCU systems are used in racecars with paddle-shift transmissions.
These electronic systems typically work in conjunction with the engine control unit (in a similar way to road cars), and are responsible for operating electronic throttle control, clutch and gearshift actuation (via an electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuator), gearshift time and speed, sensors, switches, solenoids, and other hydraulic, pneumatic, and electronic sub-systems that control and constitute the transmission control unit in a racecar.
A traffic collision, also known as a motor vehicle collision, or car crash, occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or other moving or stationary obstruction, such as a tree, pole or building.
Traffic collisions often result in injury, disability, death, and property damage as well as financial costs to both society and the individuals involved.
Road transport is statistically the most dangerous situation people deal with on a daily basis, but casualty figures from such incidents attract less media attention than other, less frequent types of tragedy.
The commonly used term car accident is increasingly falling out of favor with many government departments and organizations, with the Associated Press style guide recommending caution before using the term.
Some collisions are intentional vehicle-ramming attacks, staged crashes, vehicular homicide or vehicular suicide.
Several factors contribute to the risk of collisions, including vehicle design, speed of operation, road design, weather, road environment, driving skills, impairment due to alcohol or drugs, and behavior, notably aggressive driving, distracted driving, speeding and street racing.
In 2013, 54 million people worldwide sustained injuries from traffic collisions.
This resulted in 1.4 million deaths in 2013, up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990.
About 68,000 of these occurred with children less than five years old.
Almost all high-income countries have decreasing death rates, while the majority of low-income countries have increasing death rates due to traffic collisions.
Middle-income countries have the highest rate with 20 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, accounting for 80% of all road fatalities with 52% of all vehicles.
While the death rate in Africa is the highest (24.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), the lowest rate is to be found in Europe (10.3 per 100,000 inhabitants).
Traffic collisions can be classified by general types.
Types of collision include head-on, road departure, rear-end, side collisions, and rollovers.
Many different terms are commonly used to describe vehicle collisions.
The World Health Organization uses the term road traffic injury, while the U.S. Census Bureau uses the term motor vehicle accidents (MVA), and Transport Canada uses the term "motor vehicle traffic collision" (MVTC).
Other common terms include auto accident, car accident, car crash, car smash, car wreck, motor vehicle collision (MVC), personal injury collision (PIC), road accident, road traffic accident (RTA), road traffic collision (RTC), and road traffic incident (RTI) as well as more unofficial terms including smash-up, pile-up, and fender bender.
Many organizations, companies and government agencies have begun to avoid the term accident, instead preferring terms such as collision, crash or incident.
This is because the term accident may imply that there is no one to blame or that the collision was unavoidable, whereas most traffic collisions are the result of driving under the influence, excessive speed, distractions such as mobile phones, other risky behavior, poor road design, or other preventable factors.
In 1997, George L. Reagle, the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration wrote a letter stating that "A crash is not an accident", emphasizing that the Department's Research and Special Programs Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had all declared that "accident" should be avoided in their published writings and media communications.
In 2016, the Associated Press updated its style guide to recommend that journalists use "crash, collision, or other terms" rather than "accident" unless culpability is proven.
The AP also recommends avoiding "accident" when negligence is proven or claimed because the term "can be read as exonerating the person responsible."
In 2021, the American Automobile Association (AAA) passed a resolution to replace "car accident" with "car crash" in their vocabulary.
In 2022, the traffic management company INRIX announced that "accident" would be removed from their lexicon.
The Maryland Department of Transportation's Highway Safety Office emphasizes that "crashes are no accident", saying that "Using the word accident suggests that an incident was unavoidable, but many roadway crashes can be attributed to human error."
The Michigan Department of Transportation states that "accident" should be dropped in favor of "crash", saying that "Traffic crashes are fixable problems, caused by inattentive drivers and driver behavior.
They are NOT accidents."
In line with their Vision Zero commitments, the Portland Bureau of Transportation recommends using "crash" rather than "accident".
On the contrary, some have criticized the use of terminology other than accident for holding back safety improvements, based on the idea that such terms perpetuate a culture of blame that may discourage the involved parties from fully disclosing the facts, and thus frustrate attempts to address the real root causes.
Some traffic collisions are caused intentionally by a driver.
For example, a collision may be caused by a driver who intends to commit vehicular suicide.
Collisions may also be intentionally caused by people who hope to make an insurance claim against the other driver or may be staged for such purposes as insurance fraud.
Motor vehicles may also be involved in collisions as part of a deliberate effort to hurt other people, such as in a vehicle-ramming attack or vehicular homicide.
A number of physical injuries can commonly result from the blunt force trauma caused by a collision, ranging from bruising and contusions to catastrophic physical injury (e.g., paralysis), traumatic or non-traumatic cardiac arrest and death.
The CDC estimates that roughly 100 people die in motor vehicle crashes each day in the United States.
Following collisions, long-lasting psychological trauma may occur.
These issues may make those who have been in a crash afraid to drive again.
In some cases, psychological trauma may affect individuals' lives, causing difficulty going to work, attending school, or performing family responsibilities.
Road incidents are caused by a large number of human factors such as failing to act according to weather conditions, road design, signage, speed limits, lighting conditions, pavement markings, and roadway obstacles.
A 1985 study by K. Rumar, using British and American crash reports as data, suggested 57% of crashes were due solely to driver factors, 27% to the combined roadway and driver factors, 6% to the combined vehicle and driver factors, 3% solely to roadway factors, 3% to combined roadway, driver, and vehicle factors, 2% solely to vehicle factors, and 1% to combined roadway and vehicle factors.
Reducing the severity of injury in crashes is more important than reducing incidence and ranking incidence by broad categories of causes is misleading regarding severe injury reduction.
Vehicle and road modifications are generally more effective than behavioral change efforts with the exception of certain laws such as required use of seat belts, motorcycle helmets, and graduated licensing of teenagers.
Human factors in vehicle collisions include anything related to drivers and other road users that may contribute to a collision.
Examples include driver behavior, visual and auditory acuity, decision-making ability, and reaction speed.
A 1985 report based on British and American crash data found driver error, intoxication, and other human factors contribute wholly or partly to about 93% of crashes.
A 2019 report from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that leading contributing factors for fatal crashes included driving too fast for conditions or in excess of the speed limit, operating under the influence, failure to yield right of way, failure to keep within the proper lane, operating a vehicle in a careless manner, and distracted driving.
Drivers distracted by mobile devices had nearly four times greater risk of crashing their cars than those who were not.
Research from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute has found that drivers who are texting while driving are 23 times more likely to be involved in a crash as non-texting drivers.
Dialing a phone is the most dangerous distraction, increasing a drivers' chance of crashing by 12 times, followed by reading or writing, which increased the risk by ten times.
alertness, reading and anticipating the behavior of other drivers.
the feeling of being confident in more and more challenging situations is experienced as evidence of driving ability, and that 'proven' ability reinforces the feelings of confidence.
Confidence feeds itself and grows unchecked until something happens – a near-miss or an accident.
An Axa survey concluded Irish drivers are very safety-conscious relative to other European drivers.
This does not translate to significantly lower crash rates in Ireland.
Accompanying changes to road designs have been wide-scale adoptions of rules of the road alongside law enforcement policies that included drink-driving laws, setting of speed limits, and speed enforcement systems such as speed cameras.
Some countries' driving tests have been expanded to test a new driver's behavior during emergencies, and their hazard perception.
There are demographic differences in crash rates.
For example, although young people tend to have good reaction times, disproportionately more young male drivers feature in collisions, with researchers observing that many exhibit behaviors and attitudes to risk that can place them in more hazardous situations than other road users.
This is reflected by actuaries when they set insurance rates for different age groups, partly based on their age, sex, and choice of vehicle.
Older drivers with slower reactions might be expected to be involved in more collisions, but this has not been the case as they tend to drive less and, apparently, more cautiously.
Attempts to impose traffic policies can be complicated by local circumstances and driver behavior.
In 1969 Leeming warned that there is a balance to be struck when "improving" the safety of a road.
Conversely, a location that does not look dangerous may have a high crash frequency.
This is, in part, because if drivers perceive a location as hazardous, they take more care.
Collisions may be more likely to happen when hazardous road or traffic conditions are not obvious at a glance, or where the conditions are too complicated for the limited human machine to perceive and react in the time and distance available.
High incidence of crashes is not indicative of high injury risk.
Crashes are common in areas of high vehicle congestion, but fatal crashes occur disproportionately on rural roads at night when traffic is relatively light.
This phenomenon has been observed in risk compensation research, where the predicted reductions in collision rates have not occurred after legislative or technical changes.
One study observed that the introduction of improved brakes resulted in more aggressive driving, and another argued that compulsory seat belt laws have not been accompanied by a clearly attributed fall in overall fatalities.
Most claims of risk compensation offsetting the effects of vehicle regulation and belt use laws have been discredited by research using more refined data.
In the 1990s, Hans Monderman's studies of driver behavior led him to the realization that signs and regulations had an adverse effect on a driver's ability to interact safely with other road users.
Monderman developed shared space principles, rooted in the principles of the woonerven of the 1970s.
He concluded that the removal of highway clutter, while allowing drivers and other road users to mingle with equal priority, could help drivers recognize environmental clues.
They relied on their cognitive skills alone, reducing traffic speeds radically and resulting in lower levels of road casualties and lower levels of congestion.
Some crashes are intended; staged crashes, for example, involve at least one party who hopes to crash a vehicle in order to submit lucrative claims to an insurance company.
In the United States during the 1990s, criminals recruited Latin American immigrants to deliberately crash cars, usually by cutting in front of another car and slamming on the brakes.
It was an illegal and risky job, and they were typically paid only $100.
Jose Luis Lopez Perez, a staged crash driver, died after one such maneuver, leading to an investigation that uncovered the increasing frequency of this type of crash.
The evidence shows the risk of having a crash is increased both for vehicles traveling slower than the average speed and for those traveling above the average speed.
The risk of being injured increases exponentially with speeds much faster than the median speed.
The severity/lethality of a crash depends on the vehicle speed change at impact.
There is limited evidence suggesting lower speed limits result in lower speeds on a system-wide basis.
Most crashes related to speed involve speed too fast for the conditions.
More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of traffic calming.
In the U.S. in 2018, 9,378 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving at least one speeding driver, which accounted for 26% of all traffic-related deaths for the year.
In Michigan in 2019, excessive speed was a factor in 18.8% of the fatalities that resulted from fatal motor vehicle crashes and in 15.6% of the suspected serious injuries resulting from crashes.
The contributory factor report in the official British road casualty statistics shows for 2006, that "exceeding the speed limit" was a contributory factor in 5% of all casualty crashes (14% of all fatal crashes), and "traveling too fast for conditions" was a contributory factor in 11% of all casualty crashes (18% of all fatal crashes).
In France, in 2018, the speed limit was reduced from 90 km/h to 80 km/h on a large part of the local outside built-up area road network in the sole aim of reducing the number of road fatalities.
A common cause of collisions is driving faster than one can stop within their field of vision.
Such practice is illegal and is particularly responsible for an increase in fatalities at night – when it occurs most.
According to the Government of Canada, coroner reports from 2008 suggested almost 40% of fatally injured drivers consumed some quantity of alcohol before the collision.
Poor eyesight and/or physical impairment, with many jurisdictions setting simple sight tests and/or requiring appropriate vehicle modifications before being allowed to drive.
Insurance statistics demonstrate a notably higher incidence of collisions and fatalities among drivers aged in their teens or early twenties, with insurance rates reflecting this data.
These drivers have the highest incidence of both collisions and fatalities among all driver age groups, a fact that was observed well before the advent of mobile phones.
Females in this age group exhibit somewhat lower collision and fatality rates than males but still register well above the median for drivers of all ages.
Also within this group, the highest collision incidence rate occurs within the first year of licensed driving.
For this reason, many US states have enacted a zero-tolerance policy wherein receiving a moving violation within the first six months to one year of obtaining a license results in automatic license suspension.
South Dakota is the only state that allows fourteen-year-olds to obtain drivers' licenses.
Old age, with some jurisdictions requiring driver retesting for reaction speed and eyesight after a certain age.
Various factors such as fatigue or sleep deprivation might increase the risk, or the number of hours of driving might increase the risk of an incident.
41% of drivers self-report having fallen asleep at the wheel.: 41  It is estimated that 15% of fatal crashes involve drowsiness (10% of daytime crashes, and 24% of nighttime crashes).
Work factors can increase the risk of drowsy driving such as long or irregular hours or driving at night.
Including some prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs (notably antihistamines, opioids and muscarinic antagonists), and illegal drugs.
Research suggests that the driver's attention is affected by distracting sounds such as conversations and operating a mobile phone while driving.
Many jurisdictions now restrict or outlaw the use of some types of phones in the car.
Recent research conducted by British scientists suggests that music can also have an effect; classical music is considered to be calming, yet too much could relax the driver to a condition of distraction.
On the other hand, hard rock may encourage the driver to step on the acceleration pedal, thus creating a potentially dangerous situation on the road.
Cell phone use is an increasingly significant problem on the roads and the U.S. National Safety Council compiled more than 30 studies postulating that hands-free is not a safer option because the brain remains distracted by the conversation and cannot focus solely on the task of driving.
Several conditions can combine to create a more dangerous situation, for example, low doses of alcohol and cannabis have a more severe effect on driving performance than either in isolation.
Taking recommended doses of several drugs together, which individually do not cause impairment, may cause drowsiness.
This could be more pronounced in an elderly person whose renal function is less efficient than a younger person's.
A 1985 US study showed that about 34% of serious crashes had contributing factors related to the roadway or its environment.
Most of these crashes also involved a human factor.
The road or environmental factor was either noted as making a significant contribution to the circumstances of the crash or did not allow room to recover.
In these circumstances, it is frequently the driver who is blamed rather than the road; those reporting the collisions have a tendency to overlook the human factors involved, such as the subtleties of design and maintenance that a driver could fail to observe or inadequately compensate for.
Research has shown that careful design and maintenance, with well-designed intersections, road surfaces, visibility and traffic control devices, can result in significant improvements in collision rates.
Individual roads also have widely differing performance in the event of an impact.
In Europe, there are now EuroRAP tests that indicate how "self-explaining" and forgiving a particular road and its roadside would be in the event of a major incident.
In the UK, research has shown that investment in a safe road infrastructure program could yield a 1⁄3 reduction in road deaths, saving as much as £6 billion per year.
A consortium of 13 major road safety stakeholders has formed the Campaign for Safe Road Design, which is calling on the UK Government to make safe road design a national transport priority.
Research has shown that, across all collision types, it is less likely that seat belts were worn in collisions involving death or serious injury, rather than light injury; wearing a seat belt reduces the risk of death by about 45 percent.
Seat belt use is controversial, with notable critics such as Professor John Adams suggesting that their use may lead to a net increase in road casualties due to a phenomenon known as risk compensation.
Observation of driver behaviors before and after seat belt laws does not support the risk compensation hypothesis.
Several driving behaviors were observed on the road before and after the belt use law was enforced in Newfoundland, and in Nova Scotia during the same period without a law.
Belt use increased from 16 percent to 77 percent in Newfoundland and remained virtually unchanged in Nova Scotia.
Four driver behaviors (speed, stopping at intersections when the control light was amber, turning left in front of oncoming traffic, and gaps in following distance) were measured at various sites before and after the law.
Changes in these behaviors in Newfoundland were similar to those in Nova Scotia, except that drivers in Newfoundland drove slower on expressways after the law, contrary to the risk compensation theory.
A well-designed and well-maintained vehicle, with good brakes, tires and well-adjusted suspension will be more controllable in an emergency and thus be better equipped to avoid collisions.
Some mandatory vehicle inspection schemes include tests for some aspects of roadworthiness, such as the UK's MOT test or German TÜV conformance inspection.
The design of vehicles has also evolved to improve protection after collision, both for vehicle occupants and for those outside of the vehicle.
Much of this work was led by automotive industry competition and technological innovation, leading to measures such as Saab's safety cage and reinforced roof pillars of 1946, Ford's 1956 Lifeguard safety package, and Saab and Volvo's introduction of standard fit seatbelts in 1959.
Other initiatives were accelerated as a reaction to consumer pressure, after publications such as Ralph Nader's 1965 book Unsafe at Any Speed accused motor manufacturers of indifference to safety.
In the early 1970s, British Leyland started an intensive program of vehicle safety research, producing a number of prototype experimental safety vehicles demonstrating various innovations for occupant and pedestrian protection such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, impact-absorbing side-panels, front and rear head restraints, run-flat tires, smooth and deformable front-ends, impact-absorbing bumpers, and retractable headlamps.
The design has also been influenced by government legislation, such as the Euro NCAP impact test.
Common features designed to improve safety include thicker pillars, safety glass, interiors with no sharp edges, stronger bodies, other active or passive safety features, and smooth exteriors to reduce the consequences of an impact on pedestrians.
The UK Department for Transport publish road casualty statistics for each type of collision and vehicle through its Road Casualties Great Britain report.
These statistics show a ten-to-one ratio of in-vehicle fatalities between types of cars.
In most cars, occupants have a 2–8% chance of death in a two-car collision.
Some crash types tend to have more serious consequences.
Rollovers have become more common in recent years, perhaps due to the increased popularity of taller SUVs, people carriers, and minivans, which have a higher center of gravity than standard passenger cars.
Rollovers can be fatal, especially if the occupants are ejected because they were not wearing seat belts (83% of ejections during rollovers were fatal when the driver did not wear a seat belt, compared to 25% when they did).
After a first-generation Mercedes-Benz A-Class notoriously failed a 'moose test' (sudden swerving to avoid an obstacle) in 1997, some manufacturers enhanced suspension using stability control linked to an anti-lock braking system to reduce the likelihood of rollover.
After retrofitting these systems to its models in 1999–2000, Mercedes saw its models involved in fewer crashes.
Now, about 40% of new US vehicles, mainly the SUVs, vans and pickup trucks that are more susceptible to rollover, are being produced with a lower center of gravity and enhanced suspension with stability control linked to its anti-lock braking system to reduce the risk of rollover and meet US federal requirements that mandate anti-rollover technology by September 2011.
Motorcyclists and pillion-riders have little protection other than their clothing and helmets.
This difference is reflected in the casualty statistics, where they are more than twice as likely to suffer severely after a collision.
In 2005, there were 198,735 road crashes with 271,017 reported casualties on roads in Great Britain.
This included 3,201 deaths (1.1%) and 28,954 serious injuries (10.7%) overall.
Of these casualties 178,302 (66%) were car users and 24,824 (9%) were motorcyclists, of whom 569 were killed (2.3%) and 5,939 seriously injured (24%).
Studies in United States have shown that poor people have a greater risk of dying in a car crash than people who are well-off.
Car deaths are also higher in poorer states.
Similar studies in France or Israel have shown the same results.
This may be due to working-class people having less access to secure equipment in cars, having older cars which are less protected against crash, and needing to cover more distance to go to work each day.
While the advent of the COVID lockdown meant a decrease in road traffic in the United States, the rates of incidents, speeding, and traffic fatalities rose in 2020 and 2021 (rate as measured against vehicle miles traveled).
The traffic fatality rate jumped to 1.25 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, up from 1.06 during the same period in 2019.
Reasons cited for the increases are greater speeds, not wearing seatbelts, and driving while impaired.
In their preliminary report covering the first six months of 2021, the US nonprofit public safety advocacy group, the National Safety Council (NSC) estimated of total motor-vehicle deaths for the first six months of 2021 were 21,450, up 16% from 2020 and up 17% from 18,384 in 2019.
The estimated mileage death rate in 2021 was 1.43 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, up 3% from 1.39 in 2020 and up 24% from 1.15 in 2019.
Preliminary data also show that even as traffic levels returned to normal after the onset of COVID in March–April 2020, drivers continued to drive at excessive speeds.
A 2020 study conducted by INRIX, private company that analyzes traffic patters, behaviors and congestion, showed that as traffic levels returned to normal during the three-month period August to October 2020, growth in collisions (57%), outpaced the growth in miles traveled (22%) resulting in a higher than normal collision rate during this period.
In France, the Ministry of Interior reported that traffic incidents, crash-related injuries, and fatalities dropped in 2020 compared with 2019.
Fatalities dropped 21.4%, injuries dropped 20.9%, and incidents overall dropped 20%.
It also reported that the number of vehicles on the road dropped by 75%, which suggests the rate (incidents per vehicle-mile) increased.
People-watching.
Traffic safety culture, a variety of aspects of safety culture could impact on the number of crashes.
A large body of knowledge has been amassed on how to prevent car crashes, and reduce the severity of those that do occur.
Owing to the global and massive scale of the issue, with predictions that by 2020 road traffic deaths and injuries will exceed HIV/AIDS as a cause of death and disability, the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies have passed resolutions and held conferences on the issue.
The first United Nations General Assembly resolution and debate was in 2003 The World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims was declared in 2005.
In 2009 the first high level ministerial conference on road safety was held in Moscow.
The World Health Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations Organization, in its Global Status Report on Road Safety 2009, estimates that over 90% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low-income and middle-income countries, which have only 48% of the world's registered vehicles, and predicts road traffic injuries will rise to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030.
The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3, target 3.6 is directed at reducing road injuries and deaths.
February 2020 saw a global ministerial conference which brought the Stockholm Declaration, setting a target to reduce global traffic deaths and injuries by 50% within ten years.
The decade of 2021–2030 was declared the second decade of road safety.
Collisions migration refers to a situation where action to reduce road traffic collisions in one place may result in those collisions resurfacing elsewhere.
For example, an accident blackspot may occur at a dangerous bend.
The treatment for this may be to increase signage, post an advisory speed limit, apply a high-friction road surface, add crash barriers or any one of a number of other visible interventions.
The immediate result may be to reduce collisions at the bend, but the subconscious relaxation on leaving the "dangerous" bend may cause drivers to act with fractionally less care on the rest of the road, resulting in an increase in collisions elsewhere on the road, and no overall improvement over the area.
In the same way, increasing familiarity with the treated area will often result in a reduction over time to the previous level of care and may result in faster speeds around the bend due to perceived increased safety (risk compensation).
In 2004 50 million more were injured in motor vehicle collisions.
In 2013, between 1.25 million and 1.4 million people were killed in traffic collisions, up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990.
That number represents about 2.5% of all deaths.
Approximately 50 million additional people were injured in traffic collisions, a number unchanged from 2004.
India recorded 105,000 traffic deaths in a year, followed by China with over 96,000 deaths.
This makes motor vehicle collisions the leading cause of injury and death among children worldwide 10–19 years old (260,000 children die a year, 10 million are injured) and the sixth leading preventable cause of death in the United States.
In 2019, there were 36,096 people killed and 2.74 million people injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes on roadways in the United States.
In the state of Texas alone, there were a total of 415,892 traffic collisions, including 3,005 fatal crashes in 2012.
In Canada, they are the cause of 48% of severe injuries.
The safety performance of roadways is almost always reported as a rate.
That is, some measure of harm (deaths, injuries, or number of crashes) divided by some measure of exposure to the risk of this harm.
Rates are used so the safety performance of different locations can be compared, and to prioritize safety improvements.
Common rates related to road traffic fatalities include the number of deaths per capita, per registered vehicle, per licensed driver, or per vehicle mile or kilometer traveled.
Simple counts are almost never used.
The annual count of fatalities is a rate, namely, the number of fatalities per year.
There is no one rate that is superior to others in any general sense, it depends on the question asked and the available data.
Some agencies concentrate on crashes per total vehicle distance traveled and others combine rates.
Iowa, for example, selects high collision locations based on a combination of crashes per million miles traveled, crashes per mile per year, and value loss (crash severity).
The definition of a road-traffic fatality varies from country to country.
In the United States, the definition used in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) run by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is a person who dies within 30 days of a crash on a US public road involving a vehicle with an engine, the death being the result of the crash.
In the U.S., therefore, if a driver has a non-fatal heart attack that leads to a road-traffic crash that causes death, that is a road-traffic fatality.
If the heart attack causes death prior to the crash, it is not a road-traffic fatality.
The definition of a road-traffic fatality can change with time in the same country.
For example, fatality was defined in France as a person who dies in the six days (pre 2005) after the collision and was subsequently changed to the 30 days (post 2005) after the collision.
The world's first recorded road traffic death involving a motor vehicle occurred on 31 August 1869.
Irish scientist Mary Ward died when she fell out of her cousins' steam car and was run over by it.
The British road engineer J. J. Leeming, compared the statistics for fatality rates in Great Britain, for transport-related incidents both before and after the introduction of the motor vehicle, for journeys, including those once by water that now are undertaken by motor vehicle: For the period 1863–1870 there were: 470 fatalities per million of population (76 on railways, 143 on roads, 251 on water); for the period 1891–1900 the corresponding figures were: 348 (63, 107, 178); for the period 1931–1938: 403 (22, 311, 70) and for the year 1963: 325 (10, 278, 37).
Leeming concluded that the data showed that "travel accidents may even have been more frequent a century ago than they are now, at least for men".
He also compared the circumstances around road deaths as reported in various American states before the widespread introduction of 55 mph (89 km/h) speed limits and drunk-driving laws.
These are placed in descending order of importance.
These six accounted for 70% of the variations in the rate.
United States judges prioritized pedestrians' rights in city streets when early 20th century automobiles appeared.
Pedestrian injuries were regarded as the fault of a motorist driving too fast.
As automobile ownership increased, the rate of traffic deaths in the United States doubled from 1915 to 1921 when it reached 12 deaths per 100,000 Americans.
The right to walk was considered dispensable a century later in 2021, when the annual death rate was 12.9 per 100,000.
Safety focus on protecting the occupants of automobiles has victimized bicyclists and pedestrians whose injuries are attributed to individual carelessness.
From 2010 to 2019, fatalities rose 36% for bicyclists and nearly doubled for those on foot.
Reasons include larger vehicles, faster driving, and digital distractions making walking and biking in the United States far more dangerous than in other comparable nations.
The world's first autonomous car incident resulting in the death of a pedestrian occurred on 18 March 2018 in Arizona.
The pedestrian was walking her bicycle outside of the crosswalk, and died in the hospital after she was struck by a self-driving car being tested by Uber.
Traffic collision affect the national economy as the cost of road injuries are estimated to account for 1.0% to 2.0% of the gross national product (GNP) of every country each year.
A recent study from Nepal showed that the total economic costs of road injuries were approximately $122.88 million, equivalent to 1.52% of the total Nepal GNP for 2017, indicating the growing national financial burden associate with preventable road injuries and deaths.
The economic cost to the individuals involved in an MVC varies widely depending on geographic distribution, and varies largely on depth of accident insurance cover, and legislative policy.
In the UK for example, a survey conducted using 500 post-accident insurance policy customers, showed an average individual financial loss of £1300.00.
This is due in part to voluntary excesses that are common tactics used to reduce overall premium, and in part due to under valuation of vehicles.
By contrast, Australian insurance policy holders are subject to an average financial loss of $950.00 AUD.
Traffic citations: drivers who are involved in a collision may receive one or more traffic citations for improper driving conduct such as speeding, failure to obey a traffic control device, or driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Convictions for traffic violations are usually penalized with fines, and for more severe offenses, the suspension or revocation of driving privileges.
Civil lawsuits: a driver who causes a traffic collision may be sued for damages resulting from the collision, including damages to property and injuries to other persons.
Companies can be held liable if their employees cause motor vehicle crashes under a theory of vicarious liability.
Other times, injured people can file a product liability lawsuit against a company that designed or distributed a dangerous vehicle or car part.
Criminal prosecution: More severe driving misconduct, including impaired driving, may result in criminal charges against the driver.
In the event of a fatality, a charge of vehicular homicide is occasionally prosecuted, especially in cases involving alcohol.
Convictions for alcohol offenses may result in the revocation or long term suspension of the driver's license, and sometimes jail time, mandatory drug or alcohol rehabilitation, or both.
Sometimes, people may make false insurance claims or commit insurance fraud by staging collisions or jumping in front of moving cars.
In the United Kingdom, the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents from 31 July 2013, otherwise known as the RTA Protocol,describes the behaviour the court expects of the parties prior to the start of proceedings where a claimant claims damages valued at no more than the Protocol upper limit as a result of a personal injury sustained by that person in a road traffic accident.
As of February 2022 the "upper limit" is £25,000 for an accident which occurred on or after 31 July 2013; the limit under a previous version of the protocol was £10,000 for an accident which had occurred on or after 30 April 2010 but before 31 July 2013.
In some cases, involving a defect in the design or manufacture of motor vehicles, such as where defective design results in SUV rollovers or sudden unintended acceleration, crashes caused by defective tires, or where injuries are caused or worsened as a result of defective airbags, it is possible that the manufacturer will face a class action lawsuit.
Cars have come to represent a part of the American Dream of ownership coupled with the freedom of the road.
The violence of a car wreck provides a counterpoint to that promise and is the subject of artwork by a number of artists, such as John Salt and Li Yan.
Though English, John Salt was drawn to American landscapes of wrecked vehicles like Desert Wreck (airbrushed oil on linen, 1972).
Similarly, Jan Anders Nelson works with the wreck in its resting state in junkyards or forests, or as elements in his paintings and drawings.
American Landscape  is one example of Nelson's focus on the violence of the wreck with cars and trucks piled into a heap, left to the forces of nature and time.
This recurring theme of violence is echoed in the work of Li Yan.
His painting Accident Nº 6 looks at the energy released during a crash.
Andy Warhol used newspaper pictures of car wrecks with dead occupants in a number of his Disaster series of silkscreened canvases.
John Chamberlain used components of wrecked cars (such as bumpers and crumpled sheet metal fenders) in his welded sculptures.
Crash is a 1973 novel by English author J. G. Ballard about car-crash sexual fetishism that was made into a film by David Cronenberg in 1996.
A traffic collision, also known as a motor vehicle collision, or car crash, occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or other moving or stationary obstruction, such as a tree, pole or building.
Traffic collisions often result in injury, disability, death, and property damage as well as financial costs to both society and the individuals involved.
Road transport is statistically the most dangerous situation people deal with on a daily basis, but casualty figures from such incidents attract less media attention than other, less frequent types of tragedy.
The commonly used term car accident is increasingly falling out of favor with many government departments and organizations, with the Associated Press style guide recommending caution before using the term.
Some collisions are intentional vehicle-ramming attacks, staged crashes, vehicular homicide or vehicular suicide.
Several factors contribute to the risk of collisions, including vehicle design, speed of operation, road design, weather, road environment, driving skills, impairment due to alcohol or drugs, and behavior, notably aggressive driving, distracted driving, speeding and street racing.
In 2013, 54 million people worldwide sustained injuries from traffic collisions.
This resulted in 1.4 million deaths in 2013, up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990.
About 68,000 of these occurred with children less than five years old.
Almost all high-income countries have decreasing death rates, while the majority of low-income countries have increasing death rates due to traffic collisions.
Middle-income countries have the highest rate with 20 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, accounting for 80% of all road fatalities with 52% of all vehicles.
While the death rate in Africa is the highest (24.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), the lowest rate is to be found in Europe (10.3 per 100,000 inhabitants).
Traffic collisions can be classified by general types.
Types of collision include head-on, road departure, rear-end, side collisions, and rollovers.
Many different terms are commonly used to describe vehicle collisions.
The World Health Organization uses the term road traffic injury, while the U.S. Census Bureau uses the term motor vehicle accidents (MVA), and Transport Canada uses the term "motor vehicle traffic collision" (MVTC).
Other common terms include auto accident, car accident, car crash, car smash, car wreck, motor vehicle collision (MVC), personal injury collision (PIC), road accident, road traffic accident (RTA), road traffic collision (RTC), and road traffic incident (RTI) as well as more unofficial terms including smash-up, pile-up, and fender bender.
Many organizations, companies and government agencies have begun to avoid the term accident, instead preferring terms such as collision, crash or incident.
This is because the term accident may imply that there is no one to blame or that the collision was unavoidable, whereas most traffic collisions are the result of driving under the influence, excessive speed, distractions such as mobile phones, other risky behavior, poor road design, or other preventable factors.
In 1997, George L. Reagle, the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration wrote a letter stating that "A crash is not an accident", emphasizing that the Department's Research and Special Programs Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had all declared that "accident" should be avoided in their published writings and media communications.
In 2016, the Associated Press updated its style guide to recommend that journalists use "crash, collision, or other terms" rather than "accident" unless culpability is proven.
The AP also recommends avoiding "accident" when negligence is proven or claimed because the term "can be read as exonerating the person responsible."
In 2021, the American Automobile Association (AAA) passed a resolution to replace "car accident" with "car crash" in their vocabulary.
In 2022, the traffic management company INRIX announced that "accident" would be removed from their lexicon.
The Maryland Department of Transportation's Highway Safety Office emphasizes that "crashes are no accident", saying that "Using the word accident suggests that an incident was unavoidable, but many roadway crashes can be attributed to human error."
The Michigan Department of Transportation states that "accident" should be dropped in favor of "crash", saying that "Traffic crashes are fixable problems, caused by inattentive drivers and driver behavior.
They are NOT accidents."
In line with their Vision Zero commitments, the Portland Bureau of Transportation recommends using "crash" rather than "accident".
On the contrary, some have criticized the use of terminology other than accident for holding back safety improvements, based on the idea that such terms perpetuate a culture of blame that may discourage the involved parties from fully disclosing the facts, and thus frustrate attempts to address the real root causes.
Some traffic collisions are caused intentionally by a driver.
For example, a collision may be caused by a driver who intends to commit vehicular suicide.
Collisions may also be intentionally caused by people who hope to make an insurance claim against the other driver or may be staged for such purposes as insurance fraud.
Motor vehicles may also be involved in collisions as part of a deliberate effort to hurt other people, such as in a vehicle-ramming attack or vehicular homicide.
A number of physical injuries can commonly result from the blunt force trauma caused by a collision, ranging from bruising and contusions to catastrophic physical injury (e.g., paralysis), traumatic or non-traumatic cardiac arrest and death.
The CDC estimates that roughly 100 people die in motor vehicle crashes each day in the United States.
Following collisions, long-lasting psychological trauma may occur.
These issues may make those who have been in a crash afraid to drive again.
In some cases, psychological trauma may affect individuals' lives, causing difficulty going to work, attending school, or performing family responsibilities.
Road incidents are caused by a large number of human factors such as failing to act according to weather conditions, road design, signage, speed limits, lighting conditions, pavement markings, and roadway obstacles.
A 1985 study by K. Rumar, using British and American crash reports as data, suggested 57% of crashes were due solely to driver factors, 27% to the combined roadway and driver factors, 6% to the combined vehicle and driver factors, 3% solely to roadway factors, 3% to combined roadway, driver, and vehicle factors, 2% solely to vehicle factors, and 1% to combined roadway and vehicle factors.
Reducing the severity of injury in crashes is more important than reducing incidence and ranking incidence by broad categories of causes is misleading regarding severe injury reduction.
Vehicle and road modifications are generally more effective than behavioral change efforts with the exception of certain laws such as required use of seat belts, motorcycle helmets, and graduated licensing of teenagers.
Human factors in vehicle collisions include anything related to drivers and other road users that may contribute to a collision.
Examples include driver behavior, visual and auditory acuity, decision-making ability, and reaction speed.
A 1985 report based on British and American crash data found driver error, intoxication, and other human factors contribute wholly or partly to about 93% of crashes.
A 2019 report from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that leading contributing factors for fatal crashes included driving too fast for conditions or in excess of the speed limit, operating under the influence, failure to yield right of way, failure to keep within the proper lane, operating a vehicle in a careless manner, and distracted driving.
Drivers distracted by mobile devices had nearly four times greater risk of crashing their cars than those who were not.
Research from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute has found that drivers who are texting while driving are 23 times more likely to be involved in a crash as non-texting drivers.
Dialing a phone is the most dangerous distraction, increasing a drivers' chance of crashing by 12 times, followed by reading or writing, which increased the risk by ten times.
alertness, reading and anticipating the behavior of other drivers.
the feeling of being confident in more and more challenging situations is experienced as evidence of driving ability, and that 'proven' ability reinforces the feelings of confidence.
Confidence feeds itself and grows unchecked until something happens – a near-miss or an accident.
An Axa survey concluded Irish drivers are very safety-conscious relative to other European drivers.
This does not translate to significantly lower crash rates in Ireland.
Accompanying changes to road designs have been wide-scale adoptions of rules of the road alongside law enforcement policies that included drink-driving laws, setting of speed limits, and speed enforcement systems such as speed cameras.
Some countries' driving tests have been expanded to test a new driver's behavior during emergencies, and their hazard perception.
There are demographic differences in crash rates.
For example, although young people tend to have good reaction times, disproportionately more young male drivers feature in collisions, with researchers observing that many exhibit behaviors and attitudes to risk that can place them in more hazardous situations than other road users.
This is reflected by actuaries when they set insurance rates for different age groups, partly based on their age, sex, and choice of vehicle.
Older drivers with slower reactions might be expected to be involved in more collisions, but this has not been the case as they tend to drive less and, apparently, more cautiously.
Attempts to impose traffic policies can be complicated by local circumstances and driver behavior.
In 1969 Leeming warned that there is a balance to be struck when "improving" the safety of a road.
Conversely, a location that does not look dangerous may have a high crash frequency.
This is, in part, because if drivers perceive a location as hazardous, they take more care.
Collisions may be more likely to happen when hazardous road or traffic conditions are not obvious at a glance, or where the conditions are too complicated for the limited human machine to perceive and react in the time and distance available.
High incidence of crashes is not indicative of high injury risk.
Crashes are common in areas of high vehicle congestion, but fatal crashes occur disproportionately on rural roads at night when traffic is relatively light.
This phenomenon has been observed in risk compensation research, where the predicted reductions in collision rates have not occurred after legislative or technical changes.
One study observed that the introduction of improved brakes resulted in more aggressive driving, and another argued that compulsory seat belt laws have not been accompanied by a clearly attributed fall in overall fatalities.
Most claims of risk compensation offsetting the effects of vehicle regulation and belt use laws have been discredited by research using more refined data.
In the 1990s, Hans Monderman's studies of driver behavior led him to the realization that signs and regulations had an adverse effect on a driver's ability to interact safely with other road users.
Monderman developed shared space principles, rooted in the principles of the woonerven of the 1970s.
He concluded that the removal of highway clutter, while allowing drivers and other road users to mingle with equal priority, could help drivers recognize environmental clues.
They relied on their cognitive skills alone, reducing traffic speeds radically and resulting in lower levels of road casualties and lower levels of congestion.
Some crashes are intended; staged crashes, for example, involve at least one party who hopes to crash a vehicle in order to submit lucrative claims to an insurance company.
In the United States during the 1990s, criminals recruited Latin American immigrants to deliberately crash cars, usually by cutting in front of another car and slamming on the brakes.
It was an illegal and risky job, and they were typically paid only $100.
Jose Luis Lopez Perez, a staged crash driver, died after one such maneuver, leading to an investigation that uncovered the increasing frequency of this type of crash.
The evidence shows the risk of having a crash is increased both for vehicles traveling slower than the average speed and for those traveling above the average speed.
The risk of being injured increases exponentially with speeds much faster than the median speed.
The severity/lethality of a crash depends on the vehicle speed change at impact.
There is limited evidence suggesting lower speed limits result in lower speeds on a system-wide basis.
Most crashes related to speed involve speed too fast for the conditions.
More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of traffic calming.
In the U.S. in 2018, 9,378 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving at least one speeding driver, which accounted for 26% of all traffic-related deaths for the year.
In Michigan in 2019, excessive speed was a factor in 18.8% of the fatalities that resulted from fatal motor vehicle crashes and in 15.6% of the suspected serious injuries resulting from crashes.
The contributory factor report in the official British road casualty statistics shows for 2006, that "exceeding the speed limit" was a contributory factor in 5% of all casualty crashes (14% of all fatal crashes), and "traveling too fast for conditions" was a contributory factor in 11% of all casualty crashes (18% of all fatal crashes).
In France, in 2018, the speed limit was reduced from 90 km/h to 80 km/h on a large part of the local outside built-up area road network in the sole aim of reducing the number of road fatalities.
A common cause of collisions is driving faster than one can stop within their field of vision.
Such practice is illegal and is particularly responsible for an increase in fatalities at night – when it occurs most.
According to the Government of Canada, coroner reports from 2008 suggested almost 40% of fatally injured drivers consumed some quantity of alcohol before the collision.
Poor eyesight and/or physical impairment, with many jurisdictions setting simple sight tests and/or requiring appropriate vehicle modifications before being allowed to drive.
Insurance statistics demonstrate a notably higher incidence of collisions and fatalities among drivers aged in their teens or early twenties, with insurance rates reflecting this data.
These drivers have the highest incidence of both collisions and fatalities among all driver age groups, a fact that was observed well before the advent of mobile phones.
Females in this age group exhibit somewhat lower collision and fatality rates than males but still register well above the median for drivers of all ages.
Also within this group, the highest collision incidence rate occurs within the first year of licensed driving.
For this reason, many US states have enacted a zero-tolerance policy wherein receiving a moving violation within the first six months to one year of obtaining a license results in automatic license suspension.
South Dakota is the only state that allows fourteen-year-olds to obtain drivers' licenses.
Old age, with some jurisdictions requiring driver retesting for reaction speed and eyesight after a certain age.
Various factors such as fatigue or sleep deprivation might increase the risk, or the number of hours of driving might increase the risk of an incident.
41% of drivers self-report having fallen asleep at the wheel.: 41  It is estimated that 15% of fatal crashes involve drowsiness (10% of daytime crashes, and 24% of nighttime crashes).
Work factors can increase the risk of drowsy driving such as long or irregular hours or driving at night.
Including some prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs (notably antihistamines, opioids and muscarinic antagonists), and illegal drugs.
Research suggests that the driver's attention is affected by distracting sounds such as conversations and operating a mobile phone while driving.
Many jurisdictions now restrict or outlaw the use of some types of phones in the car.
Recent research conducted by British scientists suggests that music can also have an effect; classical music is considered to be calming, yet too much could relax the driver to a condition of distraction.
On the other hand, hard rock may encourage the driver to step on the acceleration pedal, thus creating a potentially dangerous situation on the road.
Cell phone use is an increasingly significant problem on the roads and the U.S. National Safety Council compiled more than 30 studies postulating that hands-free is not a safer option because the brain remains distracted by the conversation and cannot focus solely on the task of driving.
Several conditions can combine to create a more dangerous situation, for example, low doses of alcohol and cannabis have a more severe effect on driving performance than either in isolation.
Taking recommended doses of several drugs together, which individually do not cause impairment, may cause drowsiness.
This could be more pronounced in an elderly person whose renal function is less efficient than a younger person's.
A 1985 US study showed that about 34% of serious crashes had contributing factors related to the roadway or its environment.
Most of these crashes also involved a human factor.
The road or environmental factor was either noted as making a significant contribution to the circumstances of the crash or did not allow room to recover.
In these circumstances, it is frequently the driver who is blamed rather than the road; those reporting the collisions have a tendency to overlook the human factors involved, such as the subtleties of design and maintenance that a driver could fail to observe or inadequately compensate for.
Research has shown that careful design and maintenance, with well-designed intersections, road surfaces, visibility and traffic control devices, can result in significant improvements in collision rates.
Individual roads also have widely differing performance in the event of an impact.
In Europe, there are now EuroRAP tests that indicate how "self-explaining" and forgiving a particular road and its roadside would be in the event of a major incident.
In the UK, research has shown that investment in a safe road infrastructure program could yield a 1⁄3 reduction in road deaths, saving as much as £6 billion per year.
A consortium of 13 major road safety stakeholders has formed the Campaign for Safe Road Design, which is calling on the UK Government to make safe road design a national transport priority.
Research has shown that, across all collision types, it is less likely that seat belts were worn in collisions involving death or serious injury, rather than light injury; wearing a seat belt reduces the risk of death by about 45 percent.
Seat belt use is controversial, with notable critics such as Professor John Adams suggesting that their use may lead to a net increase in road casualties due to a phenomenon known as risk compensation.
Observation of driver behaviors before and after seat belt laws does not support the risk compensation hypothesis.
Several driving behaviors were observed on the road before and after the belt use law was enforced in Newfoundland, and in Nova Scotia during the same period without a law.
Belt use increased from 16 percent to 77 percent in Newfoundland and remained virtually unchanged in Nova Scotia.
Four driver behaviors (speed, stopping at intersections when the control light was amber, turning left in front of oncoming traffic, and gaps in following distance) were measured at various sites before and after the law.
Changes in these behaviors in Newfoundland were similar to those in Nova Scotia, except that drivers in Newfoundland drove slower on expressways after the law, contrary to the risk compensation theory.
A well-designed and well-maintained vehicle, with good brakes, tires and well-adjusted suspension will be more controllable in an emergency and thus be better equipped to avoid collisions.
Some mandatory vehicle inspection schemes include tests for some aspects of roadworthiness, such as the UK's MOT test or German TÜV conformance inspection.
The design of vehicles has also evolved to improve protection after collision, both for vehicle occupants and for those outside of the vehicle.
Much of this work was led by automotive industry competition and technological innovation, leading to measures such as Saab's safety cage and reinforced roof pillars of 1946, Ford's 1956 Lifeguard safety package, and Saab and Volvo's introduction of standard fit seatbelts in 1959.
Other initiatives were accelerated as a reaction to consumer pressure, after publications such as Ralph Nader's 1965 book Unsafe at Any Speed accused motor manufacturers of indifference to safety.
In the early 1970s, British Leyland started an intensive program of vehicle safety research, producing a number of prototype experimental safety vehicles demonstrating various innovations for occupant and pedestrian protection such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, impact-absorbing side-panels, front and rear head restraints, run-flat tires, smooth and deformable front-ends, impact-absorbing bumpers, and retractable headlamps.
The design has also been influenced by government legislation, such as the Euro NCAP impact test.
Common features designed to improve safety include thicker pillars, safety glass, interiors with no sharp edges, stronger bodies, other active or passive safety features, and smooth exteriors to reduce the consequences of an impact on pedestrians.
The UK Department for Transport publish road casualty statistics for each type of collision and vehicle through its Road Casualties Great Britain report.
These statistics show a ten-to-one ratio of in-vehicle fatalities between types of cars.
In most cars, occupants have a 2–8% chance of death in a two-car collision.
Some crash types tend to have more serious consequences.
Rollovers have become more common in recent years, perhaps due to the increased popularity of taller SUVs, people carriers, and minivans, which have a higher center of gravity than standard passenger cars.
Rollovers can be fatal, especially if the occupants are ejected because they were not wearing seat belts (83% of ejections during rollovers were fatal when the driver did not wear a seat belt, compared to 25% when they did).
After a first-generation Mercedes-Benz A-Class notoriously failed a 'moose test' (sudden swerving to avoid an obstacle) in 1997, some manufacturers enhanced suspension using stability control linked to an anti-lock braking system to reduce the likelihood of rollover.
After retrofitting these systems to its models in 1999–2000, Mercedes saw its models involved in fewer crashes.
Now, about 40% of new US vehicles, mainly the SUVs, vans and pickup trucks that are more susceptible to rollover, are being produced with a lower center of gravity and enhanced suspension with stability control linked to its anti-lock braking system to reduce the risk of rollover and meet US federal requirements that mandate anti-rollover technology by September 2011.
Motorcyclists and pillion-riders have little protection other than their clothing and helmets.
This difference is reflected in the casualty statistics, where they are more than twice as likely to suffer severely after a collision.
In 2005, there were 198,735 road crashes with 271,017 reported casualties on roads in Great Britain.
This included 3,201 deaths (1.1%) and 28,954 serious injuries (10.7%) overall.
Of these casualties 178,302 (66%) were car users and 24,824 (9%) were motorcyclists, of whom 569 were killed (2.3%) and 5,939 seriously injured (24%).
Studies in United States have shown that poor people have a greater risk of dying in a car crash than people who are well-off.
Car deaths are also higher in poorer states.
Similar studies in France or Israel have shown the same results.
This may be due to working-class people having less access to secure equipment in cars, having older cars which are less protected against crash, and needing to cover more distance to go to work each day.
While the advent of the COVID lockdown meant a decrease in road traffic in the United States, the rates of incidents, speeding, and traffic fatalities rose in 2020 and 2021 (rate as measured against vehicle miles traveled).
The traffic fatality rate jumped to 1.25 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, up from 1.06 during the same period in 2019.
Reasons cited for the increases are greater speeds, not wearing seatbelts, and driving while impaired.
In their preliminary report covering the first six months of 2021, the US nonprofit public safety advocacy group, the National Safety Council (NSC) estimated of total motor-vehicle deaths for the first six months of 2021 were 21,450, up 16% from 2020 and up 17% from 18,384 in 2019.
The estimated mileage death rate in 2021 was 1.43 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, up 3% from 1.39 in 2020 and up 24% from 1.15 in 2019.
Preliminary data also show that even as traffic levels returned to normal after the onset of COVID in March–April 2020, drivers continued to drive at excessive speeds.
A 2020 study conducted by INRIX, private company that analyzes traffic patters, behaviors and congestion, showed that as traffic levels returned to normal during the three-month period August to October 2020, growth in collisions (57%), outpaced the growth in miles traveled (22%) resulting in a higher than normal collision rate during this period.
In France, the Ministry of Interior reported that traffic incidents, crash-related injuries, and fatalities dropped in 2020 compared with 2019.
Fatalities dropped 21.4%, injuries dropped 20.9%, and incidents overall dropped 20%.
It also reported that the number of vehicles on the road dropped by 75%, which suggests the rate (incidents per vehicle-mile) increased.
People-watching.
Traffic safety culture, a variety of aspects of safety culture could impact on the number of crashes.
A large body of knowledge has been amassed on how to prevent car crashes, and reduce the severity of those that do occur.
Owing to the global and massive scale of the issue, with predictions that by 2020 road traffic deaths and injuries will exceed HIV/AIDS as a cause of death and disability, the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies have passed resolutions and held conferences on the issue.
The first United Nations General Assembly resolution and debate was in 2003 The World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims was declared in 2005.
In 2009 the first high level ministerial conference on road safety was held in Moscow.
The World Health Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations Organization, in its Global Status Report on Road Safety 2009, estimates that over 90% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low-income and middle-income countries, which have only 48% of the world's registered vehicles, and predicts road traffic injuries will rise to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030.
The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3, target 3.6 is directed at reducing road injuries and deaths.
February 2020 saw a global ministerial conference which brought the Stockholm Declaration, setting a target to reduce global traffic deaths and injuries by 50% within ten years.
The decade of 2021–2030 was declared the second decade of road safety.
Collisions migration refers to a situation where action to reduce road traffic collisions in one place may result in those collisions resurfacing elsewhere.
For example, an accident blackspot may occur at a dangerous bend.
The treatment for this may be to increase signage, post an advisory speed limit, apply a high-friction road surface, add crash barriers or any one of a number of other visible interventions.
The immediate result may be to reduce collisions at the bend, but the subconscious relaxation on leaving the "dangerous" bend may cause drivers to act with fractionally less care on the rest of the road, resulting in an increase in collisions elsewhere on the road, and no overall improvement over the area.
In the same way, increasing familiarity with the treated area will often result in a reduction over time to the previous level of care and may result in faster speeds around the bend due to perceived increased safety (risk compensation).
In 2004 50 million more were injured in motor vehicle collisions.
In 2013, between 1.25 million and 1.4 million people were killed in traffic collisions, up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990.
That number represents about 2.5% of all deaths.
Approximately 50 million additional people were injured in traffic collisions, a number unchanged from 2004.
India recorded 105,000 traffic deaths in a year, followed by China with over 96,000 deaths.
This makes motor vehicle collisions the leading cause of injury and death among children worldwide 10–19 years old (260,000 children die a year, 10 million are injured) and the sixth leading preventable cause of death in the United States.
In 2019, there were 36,096 people killed and 2.74 million people injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes on roadways in the United States.
In the state of Texas alone, there were a total of 415,892 traffic collisions, including 3,005 fatal crashes in 2012.
In Canada, they are the cause of 48% of severe injuries.
The safety performance of roadways is almost always reported as a rate.
That is, some measure of harm (deaths, injuries, or number of crashes) divided by some measure of exposure to the risk of this harm.
Rates are used so the safety performance of different locations can be compared, and to prioritize safety improvements.
Common rates related to road traffic fatalities include the number of deaths per capita, per registered vehicle, per licensed driver, or per vehicle mile or kilometer traveled.
Simple counts are almost never used.
The annual count of fatalities is a rate, namely, the number of fatalities per year.
There is no one rate that is superior to others in any general sense, it depends on the question asked and the available data.
Some agencies concentrate on crashes per total vehicle distance traveled and others combine rates.
Iowa, for example, selects high collision locations based on a combination of crashes per million miles traveled, crashes per mile per year, and value loss (crash severity).
The definition of a road-traffic fatality varies from country to country.
In the United States, the definition used in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) run by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is a person who dies within 30 days of a crash on a US public road involving a vehicle with an engine, the death being the result of the crash.
In the U.S., therefore, if a driver has a non-fatal heart attack that leads to a road-traffic crash that causes death, that is a road-traffic fatality.
If the heart attack causes death prior to the crash, it is not a road-traffic fatality.
The definition of a road-traffic fatality can change with time in the same country.
For example, fatality was defined in France as a person who dies in the six days (pre 2005) after the collision and was subsequently changed to the 30 days (post 2005) after the collision.
The world's first recorded road traffic death involving a motor vehicle occurred on 31 August 1869.
Irish scientist Mary Ward died when she fell out of her cousins' steam car and was run over by it.
The British road engineer J. J. Leeming, compared the statistics for fatality rates in Great Britain, for transport-related incidents both before and after the introduction of the motor vehicle, for journeys, including those once by water that now are undertaken by motor vehicle: For the period 1863–1870 there were: 470 fatalities per million of population (76 on railways, 143 on roads, 251 on water); for the period 1891–1900 the corresponding figures were: 348 (63, 107, 178); for the period 1931–1938: 403 (22, 311, 70) and for the year 1963: 325 (10, 278, 37).
Leeming concluded that the data showed that "travel accidents may even have been more frequent a century ago than they are now, at least for men".
He also compared the circumstances around road deaths as reported in various American states before the widespread introduction of 55 mph (89 km/h) speed limits and drunk-driving laws.
These are placed in descending order of importance.
These six accounted for 70% of the variations in the rate.
United States judges prioritized pedestrians' rights in city streets when early 20th century automobiles appeared.
Pedestrian injuries were regarded as the fault of a motorist driving too fast.
As automobile ownership increased, the rate of traffic deaths in the United States doubled from 1915 to 1921 when it reached 12 deaths per 100,000 Americans.
The right to walk was considered dispensable a century later in 2021, when the annual death rate was 12.9 per 100,000.
Safety focus on protecting the occupants of automobiles has victimized bicyclists and pedestrians whose injuries are attributed to individual carelessness.
From 2010 to 2019, fatalities rose 36% for bicyclists and nearly doubled for those on foot.
Reasons include larger vehicles, faster driving, and digital distractions making walking and biking in the United States far more dangerous than in other comparable nations.
The world's first autonomous car incident resulting in the death of a pedestrian occurred on 18 March 2018 in Arizona.
The pedestrian was walking her bicycle outside of the crosswalk, and died in the hospital after she was struck by a self-driving car being tested by Uber.
Traffic collision affect the national economy as the cost of road injuries are estimated to account for 1.0% to 2.0% of the gross national product (GNP) of every country each year.
A recent study from Nepal showed that the total economic costs of road injuries were approximately $122.88 million, equivalent to 1.52% of the total Nepal GNP for 2017, indicating the growing national financial burden associate with preventable road injuries and deaths.
The economic cost to the individuals involved in an MVC varies widely depending on geographic distribution, and varies largely on depth of accident insurance cover, and legislative policy.
In the UK for example, a survey conducted using 500 post-accident insurance policy customers, showed an average individual financial loss of £1300.00.
This is due in part to voluntary excesses that are common tactics used to reduce overall premium, and in part due to under valuation of vehicles.
By contrast, Australian insurance policy holders are subject to an average financial loss of $950.00 AUD.
Traffic citations: drivers who are involved in a collision may receive one or more traffic citations for improper driving conduct such as speeding, failure to obey a traffic control device, or driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Convictions for traffic violations are usually penalized with fines, and for more severe offenses, the suspension or revocation of driving privileges.
Civil lawsuits: a driver who causes a traffic collision may be sued for damages resulting from the collision, including damages to property and injuries to other persons.
Companies can be held liable if their employees cause motor vehicle crashes under a theory of vicarious liability.
Other times, injured people can file a product liability lawsuit against a company that designed or distributed a dangerous vehicle or car part.
Criminal prosecution: More severe driving misconduct, including impaired driving, may result in criminal charges against the driver.
In the event of a fatality, a charge of vehicular homicide is occasionally prosecuted, especially in cases involving alcohol.
Convictions for alcohol offenses may result in the revocation or long term suspension of the driver's license, and sometimes jail time, mandatory drug or alcohol rehabilitation, or both.
Sometimes, people may make false insurance claims or commit insurance fraud by staging collisions or jumping in front of moving cars.
In the United Kingdom, the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents from 31 July 2013, otherwise known as the RTA Protocol,describes the behaviour the court expects of the parties prior to the start of proceedings where a claimant claims damages valued at no more than the Protocol upper limit as a result of a personal injury sustained by that person in a road traffic accident.
As of February 2022 the "upper limit" is £25,000 for an accident which occurred on or after 31 July 2013; the limit under a previous version of the protocol was £10,000 for an accident which had occurred on or after 30 April 2010 but before 31 July 2013.
In some cases, involving a defect in the design or manufacture of motor vehicles, such as where defective design results in SUV rollovers or sudden unintended acceleration, crashes caused by defective tires, or where injuries are caused or worsened as a result of defective airbags, it is possible that the manufacturer will face a class action lawsuit.
Cars have come to represent a part of the American Dream of ownership coupled with the freedom of the road.
The violence of a car wreck provides a counterpoint to that promise and is the subject of artwork by a number of artists, such as John Salt and Li Yan.
Though English, John Salt was drawn to American landscapes of wrecked vehicles like Desert Wreck (airbrushed oil on linen, 1972).
Similarly, Jan Anders Nelson works with the wreck in its resting state in junkyards or forests, or as elements in his paintings and drawings.
American Landscape  is one example of Nelson's focus on the violence of the wreck with cars and trucks piled into a heap, left to the forces of nature and time.
This recurring theme of violence is echoed in the work of Li Yan.
His painting Accident Nº 6 looks at the energy released during a crash.
Andy Warhol used newspaper pictures of car wrecks with dead occupants in a number of his Disaster series of silkscreened canvases.
John Chamberlain used components of wrecked cars (such as bumpers and crumpled sheet metal fenders) in his welded sculptures.
Crash is a 1973 novel by English author J. G. Ballard about car-crash sexual fetishism that was made into a film by David Cronenberg in 1996.
A trip computer is a computer fitted to some cars; most modern trip computers record, calculate, and display the distance travelled, the average speed, the average fuel consumption, and real-time fuel consumption.
The first, mechanical trip computers, such as the Halda Speedpilot, produced by a Swedish taximeter manufacturer, were made in the 1950s as car accessories to enable the driver to maintain a given time schedule, particularly useful in rallying.
One was installed as standard equipment in the 1958 Saab GT750.
The 1952 Fiat 1900 came standard with a complex mechanical device, called mediometro in Italian, that showed the average speed.
In 1978, the Cadillac division of  General Motors introduced the "Cadillac Trip Computer", available on the Cadillac Seville; Chrysler also launched an electric trip computer on its low-end Omni/Horizon.
They can range from basic to complex.
The most basic trip computers incorporate average fuel mileage and perhaps an outside temperature display.
Mid-range versions often include information on fuel, speed, distance, cardinal heading (compass), and elapsed time.
The most advanced trip computers are reserved for high-end cars and often display average calculations for two drivers, a stop watch, tire-pressure information, over-speed warnings, and many other features.
Sometimes the trip computer's display is in the gauge cluster, the dashboard or navigation-system screen, or an overhead console.
Some displays include information about scheduled maintenance.
The current Acura TL does this in stages, first alerting the driver with a "Due Soon" message; once the programmed mileage is reached, the message is "Due Now"; when more time or distance has elapsed, the message changes to "Past Due".
Mercedes-Benz vehicles constantly monitor the quality of the oil and alert the driver when the oil has degraded to a certain extent.
GM and FCA vehicles provide oil change alerts based on the number and length of trips, engine temperature, and other factors.
Some vehicles also use the trip computer to allow owners to change certain aspects of vehicle behavior, e.g. how the power locks work, but in most cars "setting preferences" is now done through a center screen also used for the backup camera and radio.
Some trip computers can display the diagnostic codes that mechanics use.
This is especially useful when the mechanic wants to see the codes while driving the car.
In 2004, Linear Logic developed the ScanGauge, which at the time was the only easily installed (via OBDII) accessory that worked as a trip computer, 4 simultaneous digital gauges, and a diagnostic trouble-code reader.
This device has available 12 different measurements which can be used as the 4 digital gauges.
The units of measure can be independently selected between miles/km, gallons/liters, Celsius/Fahrenheit, and PSI/kPa.
In 2008, the OBDuino project announced a low-cost DIY trip computer design using the OBDII interface and the Arduino hobbyist microcontroller platform, released under the GPL open source license.
Transport divide (also known as transport exclusion,  transport disadvantage, transport deprivation, transportation divide, and mobility divide) refers to unequal access to transportation.
It can result in the social exclusion of disadvantaged groups.
The concept covers issues ranging from unequal access to public transportation to the unequal opportunities in global migration due to different visa policies as part of the global North–South divide.
There are a number of aspects of the transport divide.
People may have difficulty in using transport system because of physical barriers, such as a lack of accessibility for the disabled (lack of wheelchair access also impacts people with baby strollers or bicycles).
Insufficient labeling can also cause problems for people who do not speak the local language.
Financial barriers in the form of cost of services can prevent the poor from using the transport services.
Distance barriers (in the form of distance from people's homes) can make some areas mostly inaccessible to people without access to a car, particularly when local public transportation is not well developed.
Time barriers include problems caused by rush hour, but also time constraints caused by the need to arrange for care for members of the family (most often childcare), which when coupled with poor transport infrastructure can be a factor in reducing women's participation in the workforce.
There are also fear barriers such as fear of being groped, leading to the creation of women-only passenger cars.
Attempts to fix the fear barriers through increased surveillance and policing have however been linked to the lowering of the usage of such services by other groups, such as youth.
Scholars and urban planners have proposed solutions ranging from improving public transportation and increasing accessibility, subsidizing private transportation, and changing the ways in which cities are designed to improve mobility.
In the last 5 decades, globalization has had an impact on many urban regions.
Economic restructuring has created urban economic cores with surrounding suburbs.
Gentrification has forced disadvantaged individuals and households to move farther outside of the urban center, creating a need for accessible and stable transportation.
This spatial and economic shift has worsened transport disadvantage.
Housing policies have had a significant impact on the transport divide and mobility.
The subsidization of larger housing estates in suburban areas has created a concentration of poverty in urban areas.
Subsidizing low-income housing in low-density areas creates isolated communities with limited access to transportation.
It is very difficult to connect distant suburban areas through public transportation, yet low-income households struggle to have equitable access to private transportation.
There has historically been a transport divide for racial minorities in the US in the form of segregation of public transportation systems.
Many buses were segregated until the 1956 Supreme Court decision, Browder v. Gayle.
Other significant court cases related to segregation on public transportation are Keys v. Carolina Coach Co., Morgan v. Virginia, and Boynton v. Virginia.
In 1956, the US government passed the Interstate Highway Act, which provided funding to build thousands of miles of highways across the country.
This act, along with the GI bill which provided support for veterans to become homeowners, facilitated suburbanization and urban sprawl.
This made the US more car-oriented as cities became spread out and people commuted from suburbs into cities for work.
This made owning a car critical for access to suburban housing and schools.
This suburbanization was not limited to the US; many cities in Europe developed the same way in the 20th century.
Public transportation varies widely by country, and within countries, there is also striking divides.
The US, for example, has a poor public transportation system compared to many European countries.
Dense cities, such as New York or D.C., have more accessible public transportation, but some cities, such as Houston, are built around cars and highways and there is a lack of accessible and efficient public transportation.
Those without cars in these cities are at a disadvantage in finding and commuting to jobs.
Current policy favors those in suburbs with cars rather than poorer, urban populations.
Inadequate public transportation is central to the transport divide.
Public transportation provides access to employment, education, social activities, health services, food, among other necessities.
Those without private transportation such as cars often rely on public transport.
Yet, public transportation is often underfunded.
Additionally, it may not serve all populations equitably.
Those on the periphery of urban centers may struggle to find efficient public transportation if they do not live close to their places of employment.
Public transportation has traditionally not been designed for those with disabilities.
The journey cycle of public transportation has several elements, such as traveling to the transit station, purchasing tickets, finding the correct service, boarding and disembarking, that often are not accessible for those with disabilities.
Often, cars are the only feasible option for those with disabilities, which can be an additional expense and burden.
Those with cars may struggle to find accessible parking or accommodations such as ramps at destinations.
Accessibility to public transportation in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) is especially precarious, which has significant consequences for access to health services, education, and employment.
One study in Cambodia piloted a Journey Access Tool (JAT) which identifies barriers to public transportation for those with disabilities.
This tool has the potential to improve discussion about barriers to transportation and increase awareness about accessibility issues.
There has been an explosion in car ownership within the past few decades, and there are expected to be 2 billion vehicles on the road around the globe by 2030.
There are many negative consequences to such widespread car ownership, such as climate change, urban sprawl, health risks, and traffic that hinders economic growth and commutes.
However, the lack of a vehicle contributes to inequality, especially in car-dependent societies such as the US.
Mattioli (2014) describes two types of transport disadvantage: those who lack a car and those for whom car ownership is a significant burden (forced car ownership).
Those in the bottom half of income distributions are the most affected by car ownership as a significant portion of their income is allocated to purchasing and maintaining vehicles.
The cost of car ownership is often underestimated; car insurance, registration fees, parking, gas, and repairs contribute to this heavy burden of ownership.
The bottom quintile of income in the US spent about 34% of their annual income on transportation.
This type of disadvantage has also been referred to as "forced" car ownership as it creates a significant burden for households yet they require a car to  remain employed or engage in other necessary activities.
There are many external costs to widespread car usage and automobile dependency.
These costs to society include noise pollution, air pollution, climate change, congestion, and automobile accidents.
Black and Latino individuals in the US have lower rates of car ownership, and car ownership is associated with increased access to employment, higher salaries, and decreased ethnic disparities in unemployment rates.
One study in LA found that car ownership increased employment by 9%.
It is difficult to commute on public transportation from urban centers to suburban job opportunities, which reduces employment opportunities for those in urban areas without cars.
Visa waiver policies have changed in the last 5 decades as globalization and technological innovation has increased ease of mobility.
However, those from OECD and wealthy countries have more mobility rights and higher access to visa waivers than those from less wealthy countries.
This has created a "global mobility divide" as citizens of certain countries of more mobility rights than others.
Shachar (2009) uses the term "birthright lottery" to refer to how one’s ability to move throughout the world is determined by one’s country of birth.
The vast majority of rural communities do not have any transportation alternatives whatsoever.
People in rural communities may not be able to drive for many reasons, including age, disability, and socioeconomic status.
However, "mobility remains a vital part of the well-being of rural-living, older adults and transportation disadvantaged persons.”
Transportation is essential to daily life as every person must leave their home at one point or another to go to work, grocery shop, visit the doctor, or go to school.
This noted, there are countless people left trying to get a ride because they can not get somewhere themselves.
This places a large burden on individuals as people resort to informal networks to get around.
Informal networks may include people taking out unofficial loans from friends and family to purchase a vehicle or carpooling with a coworker or neighbor.
For many people, however, these informal networks are the only option as car payments are high and rural communities are not walkable.
This burden impacts the quality of everyday life of the individual as well as everyone involved.
Access to vehicles and public transportation is linked to neighborhood satisfaction.
When an individual can navigate the place they get around on their own, they are more likely to enjoy living there.
For example, cars make it easier for people to spend time with their friends and families.
Rural and suburban areas make it hard for people without a car to get around.
A Boston mother involved in a 2010 study on transportation access was quoted saying, “How am I going to get from here to the doctor's today?
I don't have money for a bus, which is an hour-and-a-half walk.
And if it's pouring rain and cold, with two babies, you can't walk an hour to the bus stop anyway.”
Stress involving transportation is higher for people in rural communities.
People with vehicles are 1.6 times more satisfied with their neighborhoods than those without cars.
In rural communities, people who lack access to a vehicle are more likely to skip doctor’s appointments.
Transportation is a social determinant of health, meaning that the inability to afford transportation correlates to negative health outcomes.
While programs like Medicaid and others have attempted to combat this issue, there are millions of uninsured Americans who can not access these services as a result.
Some rural communities have instituted transportation services that combine ride-share and shuttle practices to serve older adults and disadvantaged persons.
Project TRIP (Transporting Residents with Innovative Practices) began in 2015 in a rural area of North Carolina.
It is privately funded and “provides free individualized transportation to health care appointments, pharmacies, grocery stores/food banks, and other places that support health and well-being.”
The program lifted some of the financial burdens off of these people’s shoulders as well as allowed them to attend important medical appointments without stress.
Programs like TRIP have seen positive outcomes for rural residents, however, funding remains a concern for many.
Transport disadvantage is strongly associated with increased social exclusion (measured by factors such as income, political participation, social support) and decreased wellbeing.
Transport disadvantage can also hurt wellbeing by limiting access to resources and social services.
It also hinders relationships and feelings of community, which are very significant to wellbeing.
Socially disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to have transport disadvantages.
Another effect of transport disadvantage is increased exposure to traffic, which has risks through air pollution and car crashes.
Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live in areas with more congestion and experience negative health effects.
Such patterns and disparities are referred to as environmental racism.
One study in Australia found that transport disadvantage is associated with an increased perception of crime in a neighborhood, worsened physical and mental health, less engagement in civic and social activities, and lower overall wellbeing.
Transport disadvantage affects populations disparately.
The quality of life of elderly populations is very dependent on access to transportation as transportation allows for social interaction and hobbies.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, another dimension of the transport divide is health risk.
Those who can travel in private cars are at less risk for contracting COVID-19, compared to those who only have access to public transportation.
Additionally, those with disabilities may have increased vulnerability to COVID-19 in addition to experiencing more barriers to accessing transportation.
This pandemic made using transportation more difficult for those with disabilities by disruption to safe and stable transport, lack of communication about updates to public transport, and lack of assistance.
Funding for public transportation has been placed on the back burner.
Transportation officials gathered together at the National Conference on Rural Public and Intercity Bus Transportation in 2016 to discuss an array of transportation concerns.
Their main goal was to achieve an understanding of the research and policy needs related to rural transit for older people and the transportation disadvantaged.
In order to gauge opinions on the topic, a survey was distributed to attendees.
Most felt that the government was not doing enough to adequately address the needs of older adults and disadvantaged persons.
In response to this issue, many felt that the public and private sectors should work together to fund transportation alternatives in rural communities.
Some countries have public aid programs that subsidize cars for poor households.
However, there is criticism over these programs because of environmental concerns as well concerns about defunding public transportation.
Other scholars proposed technological solutions, such as a demand responsive virtual transport market in rural communities.
Some urban planners advocate for denser, mixed-use city neighborhoods that are more people friendly with more public transportation and less traffic.
One solution to car-related transport disadvantage is providing and encouraging use of alternative forms of transportation.
Biking and walking can be encouraged through campaigns or bike sharing initiatives, but these campaigns are fairly limited to more compact cities.
The car-free movement aims to reduce the centrality of car usage in society through urban planning and public transportation.
New urbanism, smart growth, and transit-oriented development are three approaches that aim to make cities more walkable, increase urban density, reduce suburban sprawl, and decrease the transport divide.
These sustainability-focused movements hope to improve options for housing, employment, and transportation for more equitable societies.
Ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft are on the rise, especially in Urban and Suburban areas.
In recent years these companies have attempted to expand in rural areas but are dealing with the reality that these areas have lower population densities and longer travel distances.
Startups and other tech companies have begun to emerge to combat this issue.
May Mobility, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based autonomous vehicle company is striving toward a greener, innovative future.
May Mobility’s goal of providing free, shared rides to people is an active solution for people facing the plight of transportation access.
Public transportation in transport-deprived areas can improve mobility, economic opportunity, reduce household costs, and generally improve communities.
Some scholars argue that investing more in public transportation only helps those who are transport disadvantaged if public transportation is targeted at specific groups and provides flexible services.
Transportation is essential to the livelihood of all people; everyone needs transportation.
It is a universal issue that policymakers may be able to find common ground on should it become a larger issue.
Since the beginning of the Space Age countries other than the countries with the most developed spaceflight capabilities have argued that space is for everyone and the access to it should not be controlled by those who have the capabilities to go there.
Additionally New Space entrepreneurs have argued in favour of companies to establish humanity as multiplanetary species, which has been critizised for being an escapist mission, limited to few, based on unknown criteria and offering escape as a solution to the problems on Earth instead of working on the problems.
In urban planning, transit-oriented development (TOD) is a type of urban development that maximizes the amount of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport.
It promotes a symbiotic relationship between dense, compact urban form and public transport use.
In doing so, TOD aims to increase public transport ridership by reducing the use of private cars and by promoting sustainable urban growth.
TOD typically includes a central transit stop (such as a train station, or light rail or bus stop) surrounded by a high-density mixed-use area, with lower-density areas spreading out from this center.
TOD is also typically designed to be more walkable than other built-up areas, by using smaller block sizes and reducing the land area dedicated to automobiles.
Areas that center a transit station as a hub while building residential-focused TOD development in the immediate area are known as transit villages.
The densest areas of TOD are normally located within a radius of 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 mile (400 to 800 m) around the central transit stop, as this is considered to be an appropriate scale for pedestrians, thus solving the last mile problem.
Many of the new towns created after World War II in Japan, Sweden, and France have many of the characteristics of TOD communities.
In a sense, nearly all communities built on reclaimed land in the Netherlands or as exurban developments in Denmark have had the local equivalent of TOD principles integrated in their planning, including the promotion of bicycles for local use.
In the United States, a half-mile-radius circle has become the de facto standard for rail-transit catchment areas for TODs.
A half mile (800 m) corresponds to the distance someone can walk in 10 minutes at 3 mph (4.8 km/h) and is a common estimate for the distance people will walk to get to a rail station.
The half-mile ring is a little more than 500 acres (2.0 km2) in size.
Transit-oriented development is sometimes distinguished by some planning officials from "transit-proximate development" because it contains specific features that are designed to encourage public transport use and differentiate the development from urban sprawl.
A few examples of these features include mixed-use development that will use transit at all times of day, excellent pedestrian facilities such as high quality pedestrian crossings, narrow streets, and tapering of buildings as they become more distant from the public transport node.
Another key feature of transit-oriented development that differentiates it from "transit-proximate development" is reduced amounts of parking for personal vehicles.
Easy access to transit, making it easy to get around without a car.
Dense, due to TODs being made for getting around transportation, other than private vehicles, allowing access to stores and private business.
Improved access to jobs and city services.
Increased population near transit stops, such as a commuter rail stop, which ultimately increases transit ridership across the board.
Opponents of compact, or transit oriented development typically argue that Americans, and persons throughout the world, prefer low-density living, and that any policies that encourage compact development will result in substantial utility decreases and hence large social welfare costs.
Proponents of compact development argue that there are large, often unmeasured benefits of compact development or that the American preference for low-density living is a misinterpretation made possible in part by substantial local government interference in the land market.
Many cities throughout the world are developing TOD policy.
Toronto, Portland, Montreal, San Francisco, and Vancouver among many other cities have developed, and continue to write policies and strategic plans, which aim to reduce automobile dependency and increase the use of public transit.
One of the earliest and most successful examples of TOD is Curitiba, Brazil.
Curitiba was organized into transport corridors very early on in its history.
Over the years, it has integrated its zoning laws and transportation planning to place high-density development adjacent to high-capacity transportation systems, particularly its BRT corridors.
Since the failure of its first rather grandiose city plan due to lack of funding, Curitiba has focused on working with economical forms of infrastructure, so it has arranged unique adaptations, such as bus routes (inexpensive infrastructure) with routing systems, limited access and speeds similar to subway systems.
The source of innovation in Curitiba has been a unique form of participatory city planning that emphasizes public education, discussion and agreement.
In an attempt to control the rapid growth of Guatemala City, the long-time mayor, Álvaro Arzú, implemented a plan to control growth based on transects along important arterial roads and exhibiting transit-oriented development (TOD) characteristics.
The plan adopted POT (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial) aims to allow the construction of taller mixed-use building structures right by large arterial roads.
The buildings would gradually decrease in height and density as distance would increase from arterial roads.
That is being implemented simultaneously with a bus rapid transit (BRT) system, called Transmetro.
Mexico City has battled pollution for years.
Many attempts have been made to orient citizens towards public transportation.
Expansion of metro line, both subway and bus, have been instrumental.
Following the example of Curitiba, many bus-lines were created on many of Mexico City's most important streets.
The bus-line has taken two lanes from cars to be used only by the bus-line, increasing the flow for bus transit.
The city has also made great attempts at increasing the number of bike lanes, including shutting down entire roads on certain days to be used only by bikers.
Car regulations have also increased in the city.
New regulations prevent old cars from driving in the city, other cars from driving on certain days.
Electric cars are allowed to be driven every day and have free parking.
Decreasing the public space allocated to cars and increasing regulations have become a great annoyance among daily car users.
The city hopes to push people to use more public transport.
Calgary's Transit Oriented Development (TOD) has been evolving largely around stations along Calgary's Light Rail Transit (LRT) system, also known as the CTrain network.
Although Calgary's CTrain system has been around since 1981, TOD activity has been fairly recent, with much of development taking place since 2010.
Most of the transit oriented development has taken place along the LRT system's Red Line especially around stations of the northwest leg with areas around stations at Brentwood, Dalhousie, and Banff Trail having seen the most development.
Brentwood Station for example, with multi-building developments such as University City, has seen almost 900 residential units built in the last eight years within the 600m radius of Brentwood station, as well as proposed developments that are in the works.
On the south leg of the Red Line the massive Midtown Station proposal is a reversal from previous TOD builds where development is built around existing stations.
In the case of Midtown Station, the proposal is along the CTrain line, but includes building a new station solely for the purpose of serving the development.
For The City of Calgary, TOD's are an ongoing process, but the city has published policy guidelines and implementation strategies for Transit Oriented Development.
Most of the suburban high rises were not along major rail lines like other cities until recently, when there has been incentive to do so.
Century Park is a growing condo community in southern Edmonton at the south end of the Edmonton LRT system.
It will include low to high rise condos, recreational services, shops, restaurants, and a fitness centre.
Edmonton has also had a transit-proximate development for some time in the northeastern suburbs at Clareview which includes a large park and ride, and low rise apartments among big box stores and associated power center parking.
Edmonton is also looking into some new TODs in various parts of the city.
In the northeast, there are plans to redevelop underutilized land at two sites around existing LRT, Fort Road and Stadium station.
In the west, there is plans to have some medium density condos in the Glenora neighborhood along a future LRT route as well as a TOD in the southeast in the Strathearn neighborhood along the same future LRT on existing low rise apartments.
According to the Metropolitan Development and Planning Regulation as of late 2011, 40% of new households will be built as TOD neighborhoods.
Ottawa's City Council has established transit-oriented development (TOD) priority areas in proximity to Ottawa's Light Rail Transit.
These priority areas are a mix of moderate to high-density transit-supportive developments within a 600-metre walking distance of rapid transit stations.
Toronto has a longstanding policy of encouraging new construction along the route of its primary Yonge Street subway line.
Most notable are the development of the Yonge and Eglinton area in the 1960s and 1970s; and the present development of the 2 km of the Yonge Street corridor north of Sheppard Avenue, which began in the late 1980s.
In the period since 1997 alone the latter stretch has seen the appearance of a major new shopping centre and the building and occupation of over twenty thousand new units of condominium housing.
Since the opening of the Sheppard subway line in 2002, there is a condominium construction boom along the route on Sheppard Avenue East between Yonge Street and Don Mills Road.
Vancouver has a strong history of creating new development around its SkyTrain lines and building regional town centres at major stations and transit corridors.
Of note is the Metrotown area of the suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia near the Metrotown SkyTrain Station.
The areas around stations have spurred the development of billions of dollars of high-density real estate, with multiple high-rises near the many stations, prompting concerns about rapid gentrification.
There is currently one TOD being built in Winnipeg beside the rapid transit corridor.
It is known as The Yards at Fort Rouge, and was spearheaded by the developer Gem Equities.
In phase two of the southwest rapid transit corridor, there will be four more TODs.
This phase is an interesting example of the use of fine arts in parallel with transit planning, making several of the stations sites for public art related to the social history of the area.
For over 30 years, the government has pursued a development strategy of concentrating much of its new development within 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 mile (400 to 800 m) from the county's Washington Metro rapid transit stations and the high-volume bus lines of Columbia Pike.
Within the transit areas, the government has a policy of encouraging mixed-use and pedestrian- and transit-oriented development.
Some of these "urban village" communities include Rosslyn, Ballston, Clarendon, Courthouse, Pentagon City, Crystal City, Lyon Village, Shirlington, Virginia Square, and Westover.
In 2002, Arlington received the EPA's National Award for Smart Growth Achievement for "Overall Excellence in Smart Growth" — the first ever granted by the agency.
In September 2010, Arlington County, Virginia, in partnership with Washington, D.C., opened Capital Bikeshare, a bicycle sharing system.
By February 2011, Capital Bikeshare had 14 stations in the Pentagon City, Potomac Yard, and Crystal City neighborhoods in Arlington.
Arlington County also announced plans to add 30 stations in fall 2011, primarily along the densely populated corridor between the Rosslyn and Ballston neighborhoods, and 30 more in 2012.
New Jersey has become a national leader in promoting Transit Village development through a program known as the Transit Village initiative.
The New Jersey Department of Transportation established the Transit Village Initiative in 1999, offering multi-agency assistance and grants from the annual $1 million Transit village fund to any municipality with a ready to go project specifying appropriate mixed land-use strategy, available property, station-area management, and commitment to affordable housing, job growth, and culture.
Transit village development must also preserve the architectural integrity of historically significant buildings.
Transit Village districts are defined by the half mile radius surrounding the transit station.
To become a Transit Village, towns must meet the following criteria: have existing transit, demonstrate a willingness to grow, adopt a transit-oriented-development redevelopment plan or zoning ordinance, identify specific TOD sites and projects, identify bicycle and pedestrian improvements, and identify "place making" efforts near the transit station, such as community events, celebrations, and other cultural or artistic events.
Pleasantville (1999), Morristown (1999), Rutherford (1999), South Amboy (1999), South Orange (1999), Riverside (2001), Rahway (2002), Metuchen (2003), Belmar (2003), Bloomfield (2003), Bound Brook (2003), Collingswood (2003), Cranford (2003), Matawan (2003), New Brunswick (2005), Journal Square/Jersey City (2005), Netcong (2005), Elizabeth/Midtown (2007), Burlington City (2007), the City of Orange Township (2009), Montclair (2010), Somerville (2010), Linden (2010), West Windsor (2012), East Orange (2012), Dunellen (2012), Summit (2013), Plainfield (2014), Park Ridge (2015), Irvington (2015), Hackensack (2016), Long Branch (2016), Asbury Park (2017), Newark (2021), and Atlantic City (2023).
Many neighborhoods in New York City are close to a New York City Subway station, this allows easy transport throughout the cities’ neighborhoods and central business districts.
To maximize the usage of the New York City Subway, many subway stations are surrounded by transit-oriented development, with high-density residential and commercial buildings surrounding the subway station.
Neighborhoods include, but are not limited to, Downtown Brooklyn, Midtown Manhattan, Long Island City, and Sunnyside.
Many downtowns in the Greater New York Area also are walkable with a central regional rail station.
The East Liberty neighborhood is nearing completion of a $150 million Transit Oriented Development centered around the reconfigured East Liberty Station on the city's Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway.
The development included improved access to the station with a new pedestrian bridge and pedestrian walkways that increase the effective walkshed of the station.
The East Busway is a fixed guideway route that offers riders an 8-minute ride from East Liberty to Pittsburgh's Downtown.
The Salt Lake City Metro Area has seen a strong proliferation of transit-oriented developments due to the construction of new transit lines within the Utah Transit Authority's TRAX, FrontRunner and streetcar lines.
New developments in West Valley, Farmington, Murray, Provo, Kaysville, Sugarhouse and downtown Salt Lake City have seen rapid growth and construction despite the economic downturn.
The population along the Wasatch Front has reached 2.5 million and is expected to grow 50% over the next two decades.
At 29.8%, Utah's population growth more than doubled the population growth of the nation (13.2%), with a vast majority of this growth occurring along the Wasatch Front.
Transportation infrastructure has been vastly upgraded in the past decade as a result of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games and the need to support the growth in population.
This has created a number of transit-oriented commercial and residential projects to be proposed and completed.
The San Francisco Bay Area includes nine counties and 101 cities, including San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland and Fremont.
Local and regional governments encourage transit-oriented development to decrease traffic congestion, protect natural areas, promote public health and increase housing options.
The region has designated Priority Development Areas and Priority Conservation Areas.
Current population forecasts for the region predict that it will grow by 2 million people by 2035 due to both the natural birth rate and job creation, and estimate that 50% of this growth can be accommodated in Priority Development Areas through transit-oriented development.
Major transit village projects have been developed over the past 20 years at several stations linked to the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system.
In their 1996 book, Transit Villages in the 21st Century, Michael Bernick and Robert Cervero identified emerging transit villages at several BART stations, including Pleasant Hill / Contra Costa Centre, Fruitvale, Hayward and Richmond.
MacArthur Station is a relatively new development, with construction beginning in 2011 and scheduled for completion after 2019.
Chicago passed its first TOD ordinances in 2013.
The city of Chicago started building TODs around rail stations throughout the metropolitan area.
There have been concerns that these TODs were excluding minorities since most of the TODs were built in mainly white areas therefore leaving minorities out of the picture when it came to access to transit oriented development neighborhoods.
The 2020 eTOD Policy Plan was created to fix the issues from the previous TOD plans, by creating more TOD developments in minority areas.
Compared to other developed economies, the car ownership rate in Hong Kong is very low, and approximately 90% of all trips are made by public transport.
The Rail plus Property model, which captures the value capture of land surrounding new public transport, allows Hong Kong to be one of the world's few profitable public transit systems, generating a profit of $1.5 billion in 2014.
Bandar Malaysia is an upcoming development by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
Many TOD are now being constructed in Greater Jakarta metro area such as Citra Sentul Raya and Dukuh Atas TOD.
TOD are also being constructed in cities like Surabaya, Medan, and Palembang.
There has been a proposal to develop Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) around mass transit stations in Bangkok, as well as around high-speed rail stations in cities such as Ayutthaya, Khon Kaen, Makkasan, Pattaya, and Si Racha.
In addition, there have been proposals for TOD around main regional railway stations.
The TOD proposal aims to create walkable, mixed-use communities centered around transit stations, taking advantage of their convenient transportation access.
This development is expected to bring a range of benefits, including increased economic activity, reduced traffic congestion, and improved quality of life for residents.
Melbourne, Victoria is expected to reach a population of 5 million by 2030 with the overwhelming majority of its residents relying on private automobiles.
Since the turn of the century, sporadic efforts have been made by various levels of government to implement transit-oriented development principles.
However, a lack of commitment to funding public transport infrastructure, resulting to overcrowding and amending zoning laws has dramatically slowed progress toward sustainable development for the city.
Milton, an inner suburb of Brisbane, has been identified as Queensland's first transit-oriented development under the Queensland Government's South East Queensland Regional Plan.
Milton railway station will undergo a multimillion-dollar revamp as part of the development of The Milton Residences to promote and encourage residents to embrace rail travel.
This will include a new ticketing office, new public amenities, increased visibility across platforms and new and improved access points off Milton Road and Railway Terrace.
The New South Wales state government has actively encouraged developments around stations on the Sydney Trains and Sydney Metro networks through its Priority Precincts plan.
Several stations such as Chatswood, Burwood, Parramatta and Rhodes have large scale apartment developments built within close proximity during the 2010s.
New apartment and office tower developments along the future Sydney Metro stations are being planned as integrated developments with the stations themselves.
Examples of this include Victoria Cross Station and Crows Nest Station whilst existing stations such as Castle Hill and Epping have also had intensified development.
Honeysuckle is an urban renewal developed on 50 hectares of former industrial land in Newcastle, NSW.
This project, carried out by the Honeysuckle Development Corporation, has at its core the emerge of mixed residential and commercial areas commutable to the Newcastle Light Rail and other alternative transport methods.
The term transit-oriented development, as a US-born concept, is rarely used in Europe, although many of the measures advocated in US transit-oriented development are also stressed in Europe.
Many European cities have long been built around transit systems and there has thus often been little or no need to differentiate this type of development with a special term as has been the case in the US.
An example of this is Copenhagen's Finger Plan from 1947, which embodied many transit-oriented development aspects and is still used as an overall planning framework today.
Recently, scholars and technicians have taken interest in the concept, however.
Whereas the city of Paris has a centuries-long history, its main frame dates to the 19th century.
The subway network was made to solve both linkage between the five main train stations and local transportation assets for citizens.
The whole area of Paris City has metro stations no more than 500 metres apart.
Recent bicycle and car rental systems (Velib and Autolib) also ease travel, in the very same way that TOD emphasizes.
So do the new trams linking suburbs close to Paris proper, and tramline 3 around the edge of the city of Paris.
The La Défense area is an example of a large scale transit-oriented district.
In the southern part of the Randstad a neighborhood according to the principles of TOD will be built.
In Isfahan the subway is used for a TOD program.
TOD has been shown to reduce multiple types of emissions in Los Angeles during life-cycle assessments; greenhouse gasses, respiratory irritants, and smog forming emissions can be reduced by approximately 30% in TOD when compared to lower density areas.
This is attributed to various factors including residents having more travel options, reduced travel distances for everyday activities, and higher density housing reducing energy use per residence.
In Dhaka TOD can also aid in reducing travel related CO2 emissions on a community level, specifically for work and school trips, due to residents traveling less distance to these locations.
And it is suggested that the improvements in public transportation, pedestrian, and bicycle infrastructure that are associated with TOD and related policies may improve these reductions within Dhaka and other developing cities.
However, TOD has also been found to be a major contributor to the urban heat island effect in Brisbane both having higher temperature and more rapidly increasing temperatures than non-TOD areas.
This difference has been linked to TOD having a larger portion of non-porous land and less natural spaces, which must be considered when planning TOD.
TOD, specifically along light rail transit lines, have been seen to increase the amount of new businesses in Phoenix within one mile of a station, with businesses in the knowledge, service, and retail industries experiencing 88%, 40%, and 24% more new starts respectively than non-TOD areas.
However, a decrease in manufacturing facilities has also been noted in TOD; similar results are likely to be seen in other U.S. cities.
The value of condominiums in San Diego generally increases with decreasing distance from light rail transit stations, increasing walkability of neighborhoods, and increasing available services.
This points to TOD as a preferable style of neighborhood to people, showing that market-driven creation of TOD neighborhoods may be possible in U.S. metropolitan areas.
Resident expenses in TOD have been shown to be lower in well developed areas in spite of the generally higher rental costs due to lower energy use and travel costs, in Los Angeles the savings are around $3100 per year for one household.
Behavioral impacts that are related to the effect on car use and travel behavior.
First, since lowering car dependency and car ownership is one of the major goals of TOD, the existing studies consistently showed that TOD was negatively associated with car ownership.
Other studies focus on the influence of TOD on residents’ travel behaviors.
Though it seems self-evident that residents living in TOD areas are easier and thus more likely to travel by public transport, the existence of residential differences and the TOD-reduced gentrification make the linkages between TOD and public travel trips complex.
Psychological impacts related to the subjective well-being and other sentiments.
Studies on the psychological impacts of TOD mainly focus on subjective well-being, especially satisfaction with the travel domain and the life in general.
First, a series of studies have examined the effects of TOD on travel satisfaction.
While traveling by public transit is usually less pleasant compared with driving or active travel, TOD as a well-defined transit area is likely to generate more comfortable traveling experiences.
Likewise, residents living within the TOD area tended to be more satisfied with public commuting.
Nonetheless, since travel is an important life domain, satisfaction with public transport system is expected to significantly contribute to overall wellbeing.
Impacts related to social inequality and TOD-induced gentrification.
TOD is usually associated with regeneration of the old urban land use and increasing housing values, it may crowd out the low-income groups and cause large-scale residential mobility, significant neighborhood change and considerable upgrading of the TOD areas.
Accordingly, TOD-induced gentrification is an emerging topic in transportation research in the recent decade.
One criticism of transit-oriented development is that it has the potential to spur gentrification in low-income areas.
In some cases, TOD can raise the housing costs of formerly affordable neighborhoods, pushing low- and moderate-income residents farther away from jobs and transit.
When this happens, TOD projects can disrupt low-income neighborhoods.
This can be very concerning due to the fact that lower income people tend to use (and need) transit more than higher income people.
When executed with equity in mind, however, TOD has the potential to benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities: it can link workers to employment centers, create construction and maintenance jobs, and has the potential to encourage investment in areas that have suffered neglect and economic depression.
Moreover, it is well recognized that neighborhood development restrictions, while potentially in the immediate neighborhood's best interest, contribute to regional undersupply of housing and drive up the cost of housing in general across a region.
TOD reduces the overall cost of housing in a region by contributing to the housing supply, and therefore generally improves equity in the housing market.
TOD also reduces transportation costs, which can have a greater impact on LMI households since they spend a larger share of their income on transportation relative to higher-income households.
This frees up household income that can be used on food, education, or other necessary expenses.
Low-income people are also less likely to own personal vehicles and therefore more likely to depend exclusively on public transportation to get to and from work, making reliable access to transit a necessity for their economic success.
TOD began in 1993 with the publication of Peter Calthorpe's book The Next American Metropolis.
Calthorpe and his colleagues based their theory on the ideals of the Garden city movement.
A transit city is a type of city designed around the use of public transport.
In such cities, urban development is centered around rail stations or tramlines.
The transit city emerged in the industrial world around 1850, due to the advent of new transport technologies - the steam train and electric tram.
This facilitated faster travel, leading to larger cities, although most locations still remained within walking or bicycle distance.
During the period from 1850 to 1940, it was the dominant type of city in industrialized countries.
In less-developed parts of the world, however, mass transit technology was not adopted as greatly, with many cities remaining walking cities up until the 1970s onwards, when they transformed directly into automotive cities.
Toyota Motor Corporation (Japanese: トヨタ自動車株式会社, Hepburn: Toyota Jidōsha kabushikigaisha, IPA: [toꜜjota], English: , commonly known as simply Toyota) is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi, Japan.
It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937.
Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.
The company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father.
Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world.
While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.
After World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.
In the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.
The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of December 2020.
Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle.
By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.
As of 2024, the Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under four brands: Daihatsu, Hino, Lexus and the namesake Toyota.
The company also holds a 20% stake in Subaru Corporation, a 5.1% stake in Mazda, a 4.9% stake in Suzuki, a 4.6% stake in Isuzu, a 3.8% stake in Yamaha Motor Corporation, and a 2.8% stake in Panasonic, as well as stakes in vehicle manufacturing joint-ventures in China (FAW Toyota and GAC Toyota), the Czech Republic (TPCA), India (Toyota Kirloskar) and the United States (MTMUS).
Toyota is listed on the London Stock Exchange, Nagoya Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where its stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.
In 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic loom.
The principle of jidoka, which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System.
Looms were built on a small production line.
In 1929, the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers, generating the starting capital for automobile development.
Under the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established an Automobile Division on September 1, 1933, and formally declared its intention to begin manufacturing automobiles on January 29, 1934.
A prototype Toyota Type A engine was completed on September 25, 1934, with the company's first prototype sedan, the A1, completed the following May.
As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.
Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for ¥2,900, ¥200 cheaper than the Ford truck.
A total of 379 G1 trucks were ultimately produced.
In April 1936, Toyoda's first passenger car, the Model AA, was completed.
The sales price was ¥3,350, ¥400 cheaper than Ford or GM cars.
The company's plant at Kariya was completed in May.
In July, the company filled its first export order, with four G1 trucks exported to northeastern China.
On September 19, 1936, the Japanese imperial government officially designated Toyota Automatic Loom Works as an automotive manufacturer.
Vehicles were originally sold under the name "Toyoda" (トヨダ), from the family name of the company's founder, Kiichirō Toyoda.
In September 1936, the company ran a public competition to design a new logo.
Of 27,000 entries, the winning entry was the three Japanese katakana letters for "Toyoda" in a circle.
However, Rizaburo Toyoda, who had married into the family and was not born with that name, preferred "Toyota" (トヨタ) because it took eight brush strokes (a lucky number) to write in Japanese, was visually simpler (leaving off the diacritic at the end), and with a voiceless consonant instead of a voiced one (voiced consonants are considered to have a "murky" or "muddy" sound compared to voiceless consonants, which are "clear").
Since toyoda literally means "fertile rice paddies", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming.
The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd.
Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president.
Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.
The Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.
At the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.
Japan was heavily damaged in World War II and Toyota's plants, which were used for the war effort, were not spared.
On August 14, 1945, one day before the surrender of Japan, Toyota's Koromo Plant was bombed by the Allied forces.
After the surrender, the U.S.-led occupying forces banned passenger car production in Japan.
However, automakers like Toyota were allowed to begin building trucks for civilian use, in an effort to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.
The U.S. military also contracted with Toyota to repair its vehicles.
By 1947, there was an emerging global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., who had been allies in World War II.
U.S. priorities shifted (the "Reverse Course") from punishing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the economy, and, to an extent, remilitarizing Japan.
Under these new policies, in 1949, Japanese automakers were allowed to resume passenger car production, but at the same time, a new economic stabilization program to control inflation plunged the automotive industry into a serious shortage of funds, while many truck owners defaulted on their loans.
Ultimately, the Bank of Japan, the central bank of the country, bailed out the company, with demands that the company institute reforms.
As the 1950s began, Toyota emerged from its financial crisis a smaller company, closing factories and laying off workers.
Meanwhile, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota.
The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company's business performance.
In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers.
The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.
Toyota started developing its first full-fledged passenger car, the Toyopet Crown, in 1952.
Prior to the Crown, Toyota had been outsourcing the design and manufacturing of auto bodies, which were then mounted on truck frames made by Toyota.
The project was a major test for Toyota, who would need to build bodies and develop a new chassis that would be comfortable, but still stand up to the muddy, slow, unpaved roads common in Japan at the time.
The project had been championed for many years by founder Kiichiro Toyoda, who died suddenly on March 27, 1952.
The first prototypes were completed in June 1953 and began extensive testing, before the Crown went on sale in August 1955.
The car was met with positive reviews from around the world.
After the introduction of the Crown, Toyota began aggressively expanding into the export market; the company entered Saudi Arabia for the first time in 1955 with Land Cruisers, following an agreement reached with Abdul Latif Jameel (founder of his company of the same name); Toyota also brought Land Cruisers into neighboring Yemen in 1956.
In 1958, Toyota established a production facility in Brazil, the company's first outside of Japan.
Toyota entered the United States market in 1958, attempting to sell the Toyopet Crown.
The company faced problems almost immediately, the Crown was a flop in the U.S. with buyers finding it overpriced and underpowered (because it was designed for the bad roads of Japan, not high-speed performance).
In response, exports of the Crown to the United States were suspended in the early 1960s in favor of the Land Cruiser and the Tiara.
After Kiichiro's death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades.
Eiji helped establish the company's first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.
At the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle.
As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle.
At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure.
To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.
Toyota also found success in the United States in 1965 with the Toyota Corona compact car, which was redesigned specifically for the American market with a more powerful engine.
The Corona helped increase U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase) and helped the company become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967.
Toyota's first manufacturing investment in the United States came in 1972 when the company struck a deal with Atlas Fabricators, to produce truck beds in Long Beach, in an effort to avoid the 25% "chicken tax" on imported light trucks.
By importing the truck as an incomplete chassis cab (the truck without a bed), the vehicle only faced a 4% tariff.
Once in the United States, Atlas would build the truck beds and attach them to the trucks.
The partnership was successful and two years later, Toyota purchased Atlas.
The energy crisis of the 1970s was a major turning point in the American auto industry.
Before the crisis, large and heavy vehicles with powerful but inefficient engines were common.
But in the years after, consumers started demanding high-quality and fuel-efficient small cars.
Domestic automakers, in the midst of their malaise era, struggled to build these cars profitably, but foreign automakers like Toyota were well positioned.
This, along with growing anti-Japanese sentiment, prompted the U.S. Congress to consider import restrictions to protect the domestic auto industry.
The 1960s also saw the slight opening of the Japanese auto market to foreign companies.
In an effort to strengthen Japan's auto industry ahead of the market opening, Toyota purchased stakes in other Japanese automakers.
That included a stake in Hino Motors, a manufacturer of large commercial trucks, buses and diesel engines, along with a 16.8 percent stake in Daihatsu, a manufacturer of kei cars, the smallest highway-legal passenger vehicles sold in Japan.
That began what became a long-standing partnership between Toyota and the two companies.
As part of the partnership, Daihatsu would supply kei cars for Toyota to sell and to a lesser extent Toyota would supply full-sized cars for Daihatsu to sell (a process known as rebadging), allowing both companies to sell a full line-up of vehicles.
After the successes of the 1970s, and the threats of import restrictions, Toyota started making additional investments in the North American market in the 1980s.
In 1981, Japan agreed to voluntary export restraints, which limited the number of vehicles the nation would send to the United States each year, leading Toyota to establish assembly plants in North America.
The U.S. government also closed the loophole that allowed Toyota to pay lower taxes by building truck beds in America.
Also in 1981, Eiji Toyoda stepped down as president and assumed the title of chairman.
He was succeeded as president by Shoichiro Toyoda, the son of the company's founder.
Within months, Shoichiro started to merge Toyota's sales and production organizations, and in 1982 the combined companies became the Toyota Motor Corporation.
The two groups were described as "oil and water" and it took years of leadership from Shoichiro to successfully combine them into one organization.
In Japan, Toyota offered mid-level luxury cars that were a class below the Crown and Century and offered hardtop coupes and sedans.
The Supra, Mark II, Cresta and Chaser offered several trim packages with different engine displacements to provide buyers with annual road tax advantages.
At the same time, sports cars like Celica, Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno sold very well.
Efforts to open a Toyota assembly plant in the United States started in 1980, with the company proposing a joint-venture with the Ford Motor Company.
Those talks broke down in July 1981.
Eventually in 1984, the company struck a deal with General Motors (GM) to establish a joint-venture vehicle manufacturing plant called NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.) in Fremont, California.
GM saw the joint venture as a way to get access to a quality small car and an opportunity to learn about The Toyota Way and the Toyota Production System.
For Toyota, the factory gave the company its first manufacturing base in North America allowing it to avoid any future tariffs on imported vehicles and saw GM as a partner who could show them how to navigate the American labor environment.
The plant would be led by Tatsuro Toyoda, the younger brother of company president Shoichiro Toyoda.
The first Toyota assembled in America, a white Corolla, rolled off the line at NUMMI on October 7, 1986.
Toyota received its first Japanese Quality Control Award at the start of the 1980s and began participating in a wide variety of motorsports.
Conservative Toyota held on to rear-wheel-drive designs for longer than most; while a clear first in overall production they were only third in production of front-wheel-drive cars in 1983, behind Nissan and Honda.
In part due to this, Nissan's Sunny managed to squeeze by the Corolla in numbers built that year.
Before the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in international markets.
Prior to the debut of Lexus, Toyota's two existing flagship models, the Crown and Century, both catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar.
The company had been developing the brand and vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.
The LS 400 flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.
In the 1990s, Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup, including a full-sized pickup, the T100 (and later the Tundra), several lines of SUVs, a sport version of the Camry, known as the Camry Solara.
They would also launch newer iterations of their sports cars, namely the MR2, Celica, and Supra during this era.
In Japan, Toyota continued to cater to the growing demand for mid-level luxury cars and offered several conventional and pillared hardtops sedans at its Japanese dealership network.
The Soarer, Mark II, Cresta, Chaser, Corona EXiV, and Carina ED found many buyers.
At the same time, sports cars like the Supra, Celica, MR2, Corolla Levin, Sprinter Trueno, and even the subcompact Starlet GT reflected a time of prosperity.
December 1997 saw the introduction of the first-generation Toyota Prius, the first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car.
The vehicle would be produced exclusively for the Japanese market for the first two years.
With a major presence in Europe, due to the success of Toyota Team Europe in motorsport, the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering, TMME, to help market vehicles in the continent.
Two years later, Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom, TMUK, as the company's cars had become very popular among British drivers.
Bases in Indiana, Virginia, and Tianjin were also set up.
Toyota also increased its ownership of Daihatsu during this period.
In 1995, Toyota increased its shareholding in the company to 33.4 percent, giving Toyota the ability to veto shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting.
In 1998, Toyota increased its holding in the company to 51.2 percent, becoming the majority shareholder.
On September 29, 1999, the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges.
The later half of the 1990s would also see the Toyoda brothers step back from the company their father had founded.
In 1992, Shoichiro Toyoda would shift to become chairman, allowing his brother Tatsuro to become president, a job he held until his retirement in 1995.
Shoichiro would step down as chairman in 1999.
Both would retain honorary advisory roles in the company.
Hiroshi Okuda would lead the company as president from 1995 until 1999 when he became chairman and the President's office would be filled by Fujio Cho.
In August 2000, exports began of the Prius.
In 2001, Toyota acquired its long time partner, truck and bus manufacturer Hino Motors.
In 2002, Toyota entered Formula One competition and established a manufacturing joint venture in France with French automakers Citroën and Peugeot.
A youth-oriented marque for North America, Scion, was introduced in 2003.
Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world's leading companies for the year 2005.
Also in 2005, Fujio Cho would shift to become chairman of Toyota and would be replaced as president by Katsuaki Watanabe.
In 2007, Toyota released an update of its full-sized truck, the Tundra, produced in two American factories, one in Texas and one in Indiana.
Motor Trend named the 2007 Toyota Camry "Car of the Year" for 2007.
It also began the construction of two new factories, one in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and the other in Blue Springs, Mississippi, USA.
The company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008.
Toyota was hit by the global financial crisis of 2008 as it was forced in December 2008 to forecast its first annual loss in 70 years.
In January 2009, it announced the closure of all of its Japanese plants for 11 days to reduce output and stocks of unsold vehicles.
In October 2009, Toyota announced that they were establishing an office in South Korea and launched the Camry sedan, Camry hybrid, Prius and the RAV4 during the launching event at the Grand Hyatt Seoul.
Between 2009 and 2011, Toyota conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration.
The recalls were to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped and to correct the possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.
At least 37 were killed in crashes allegedly related to unintended acceleration, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were recalled, Toyota was sued for personal injuries and wrongful deaths, paid US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value, and paid a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image.
Amid the unintended acceleration scandal, Katsuaki Watanabe stepped down as company president.
He was replaced by Akio Toyoda, grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda, on June 23, 2009.
Akio had been with Toyota since 1984, working jobs in production, marketing and product development, and took a seat on the board of directors in 2000.
Akio's promotion by the board marked the return of a member of the Toyoda family to the top leadership role for the first time since 1999.
In 2011, Toyota, along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry, suffered from a series of natural disasters.
The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a severe disruption of the supplier base and a drop in production and exports.
Severe flooding during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand affected Japanese automakers that had chosen Thailand as a production base.
Toyota is estimated to have lost production of 150,000 units to the tsunami and production of 240,000 units to the floods.
On February 10, 2014, it was announced that Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia by the end of 2017.
The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture, and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.
The company planned to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017, and retain its Altona plant for other functions.
The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.
Both Ford Motor Company and General Motors (Holden) followed suit, ending Australian production in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
The automaker narrowly topped global sales for the first half of 2014, selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending June 30, 2014, an increase of 3.8% on the same period the previous year.
Volkswagen AG, which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles, was close behind.
In August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its spare-parts prices in China by up to 35%.
The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China's National Development and Reform Commission of Toyota's Lexus spare-parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales servicing.
In November 2015, the company announced that it would invest US$1 billion over the next 5 years into artificial intelligence and robotics research.
In 2016, Toyota invested in Uber.
In 2020, a corporate governance report showed that Toyota owns 10.25 million shares of Uber, which was valued at $292.46 million as of March 30, 2020.
According to Reuters, this was roughly 0.6 per cent of Uber's outstanding shares.
In March 2016, Toyota partnered with Yanmar to create a fiberglass pleasure boat using Yanmar outboard marine diesel engines or Toyota inboard engines.
In August 2016, the company purchased all remaining assets of Daihatsu, making the manufacturer of small cars a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.
On August 27, 2018, Toyota announced an investment of US$500 million in Uber's autonomous cars.
In October 2019, Toyota backed the Trump Administration's proposal that federal authority should override California's ability to set its own emissions standards for automobiles.
The proposal would reduce California's 2025 fuel efficiency standard from about 54.5 to 37 MPG.
This shift by Toyota away from fuel efficiency damaged the company's reputation as a green brand.
By 2020, Toyota reclaimed its position as the largest automaker in the world, surpassing Volkswagen.
It sold 9.528 million vehicles globally despite an 11.3% drop in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This includes subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors.
In March 2021, Toyota, its subsidiary Hino, and Isuzu announced the creation of a strategic partnership between the three companies.
Toyota acquired a 4.6% stake in Isuzu while the latter plans to acquire Toyota shares for an equivalent value.
The three companies said they would form a new joint venture by April called Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation with the aim of developing fuel cell and electric light trucks.
Toyota would own an 80% stake in the venture while Hino and Isuzu would own 10% each.
In April 2021, Toyota said that it will buy Lyft's self-driving technology unit for $550 million and merge it with its newly created Woven Planet Holdings automation division.
In June 2021, the company defended its donations to the United States Republican lawmakers after they voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying it did not believe it was "appropriate to judge members of Congress" for that one vote.
A report by Axios found that Toyota was the top donor to 2020 election objectors, by a substantial margin.
The company then reversed course in July 2021 and ceased donations to election objectors, releasing a statement saying it understood that its PAC's donations to those objectors, which far outpaced those of any other company, "troubled some stakeholders."
Toyota resumed donations after a six-month pause.
In December 2021, Toyota announced that it would invest ¥8,000,000,000,000 ($70 billion at 2021 exchange rate) in electric vehicles by 2030, launch 30 EV models worldwide by that year, and set a sales target of 3.5 million electric vehicles in 2030.
Toyota will increase its software engineer intake to around 40% to 50% of all technical hires from the second quarter of 2022, the move plans to address a transformation to so-called CASE — connected, autonomous, shared and electric — technologies in an environment of intensifying global competition.
In 2021, Toyota told some of its suppliers to increase their semiconductor inventory levels from the conventional three months to five months in response to the COVID-19 chip shortage.
The "just-in-time" supply chain in which parts are only delivered when necessary, had already been revised after the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami in Japan, lifting inventories across the entire procurement network.
The time it takes Toyota to turn over its inventory increased by around 40% during the past ten years, to 36.36 days as of March 2021.
In June 2022, Toyota recalled 2,700 of its first mass-produced all-electric vehicles due to worries that their wheels could fall off during driving.
It was discovered that the bolts on the bZ4X's wheels could loosen up to the point where the wheel simply detaches from the car, causing a loss of control over the vehicle and possible accident.
In August 2022, Toyota pledged up to $5.6 billion towards production of electric vehicle battery production and announced an increase in investment in its plant near Greensboro, North Carolina.
Also in 2022, Toyota managed to maintain its position as the world's best-selling automaker for the third year in a row.
In January 2023, Toyota CEO and President Akio Toyoda announced that he was stepping down and passing the position on to Koji Sato.
Akio is the great-grandson of company founder Rizaburo Toyoda.
Sato had previously run Lexus, Toyota's luxury car brand.
The change is set to take effect on April 1, 2023.
In 2023, after negotiating with the unions, Toyota implemented the largest increase in employee wages in 20 years.
In 1950, Toyota was split into Toyota Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Sales Co. (sales arm of Toyota); the two companies merged in 1982 to create one unified company, with then-Toyota Motor Co. President Eiji Toyoda becoming chairman.
Chairmen listed prior to 1982 below were for the pre-merger Toyota Motor Co. only.
Similar to the chairman position, in 1982 the then-Toyota Motor Sales Co. President Shoichiro Toyoda becoming President.
President's listed prior to 1982 below were for the pre-merger Toyota Motor Co. only.
Toyota officially lists approximately 70 different models sold under its namesake brand, including sedans, coupes, vans, trucks, hybrids, and crossovers.
Many of these models are produced as passenger sedans, which range from the subcompact Toyota Yaris, compact Corolla, to mid-size Camry and full-size Avalon.
Minivans include the Innova, Alphard/Vellfire, Sienna, and others.
Several small cars, such as the xB and tC, were sold under the Scion brand.
Toyota SUV and crossover line-up grew quickly in the late 2010s to 2020s due to the market shift to SUVs.
Toyota crossovers range from the subcompact Yaris Cross and C-HR, compact Corolla Cross and RAV4, to midsize Harrier/Venza and Kluger/Highlander.
Other crossovers include the Raize, Urban Cruiser.
Toyota SUVs range from the midsize Fortuner to full-size Land Cruiser.
Other SUVs include the Rush, Prado, FJ Cruiser, 4Runner, and Sequoia.
Toyota first entered the pickup truck market in 1947 with the SB that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets.
It was followed in 1954 by the RK (renamed in 1959 as the Stout) and in 1968 by the compact Hilux.
With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable.
Extended cab and crew cab versions were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market in various cab lengths, with gasoline or diesel engines, and 2WD and 4WD versions.
In North America, the Hilux became a major model for the company, leading the company to launch the Tacoma in 1995.
The Tacoma was based on the Hilux, but with a design intended to better suit the needs of North American consumers who often use pickup trucks as personal vehicles.
The design was a success and the Tacoma became the best-selling compact pickup in North America.
After the success of its compact Hilux pickups in North America, Toyota decided to enter the full-size pickup market, which was traditionally dominated by domestic automakers.
The company introduced the T100 for the 1993 US model year.
The T100 had a full-size 8-foot (2.4 m) long bed, but suspension and engine characteristics were similar to that of a compact pickup.
Sales were disappointing and the T100 was criticized for having a small V6 engine (especially compared to the V8 engines common in American full-size trucks), lacking an extended-cab version, being too small, and too expensive (because of the 25% tariff on imported trucks).
In 1995, Toyota added the more powerful V6 engine from the new Tacoma to the T100 and also added an extended cab version.
In 1999, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger Tundra, which would be built in the US with a V8 engine and styling that more closely matched other American full-size trucks.
In the Japanese home market, Toyota has two flagship models: the Crown premium sedan and the Century limousine.
In the 1980s, Toyota wanted to expand its luxury car offerings but realized that existing Japanese-market flagship models had little global appeal and could not compete with established brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar or the Acura and Infiniti marquees being launched by Japanese competitors.
Before the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in markets outside of Japan.
The company developed the brand and its vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.
The Lexus LS flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.
Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV models.
The Lexus brand was introduced to the Japanese market in 2005, previously all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque.
The Toyota Coaster is a minibus introduced in 1969 that seats 17 passengers.
The Coaster is widely used in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia, but also in the developing world for minibus operators in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, the Caribbean, and South America to operate as public transportation.
Toyota is the world's leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, one of the largest companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe, and the first to commercially mass-produce and sell such vehicles, with the introduction of the XW10 Toyota Prius in 1997.
The company's series hybrid technology is called Hybrid Synergy Drive, and it was later applied to many vehicles in Toyota's product lineup, starting first with the Camry and the technology was also brought to the luxury Lexus division.
As of January 2020, Toyota Motor Corporation sells 44 Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models in over 90 countries and regions around the world, and the carmaker has sold over 15 million hybrid vehicles since 1997.
The Prius family is the world's top-selling hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle nameplate with almost 4 million units sold worldwide as of January 2017.
In 2002, Toyota began a development and demonstration program to test the Toyota FCHV, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the Toyota Highlander production SUV.
Toyota also built a FCHV bus based on the Hino Blue Ribbon City low-floor bus.
Toyota has built several prototypes/concepts of the FCHV since 1997, including the Toyota FCHV-1, FCHV-2, FCHV-3, FCHV-4, and Toyota FCHV-adv.
The Toyota FCV-R fuel cell concept car was unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show.
The FCV-R sedan seats four and has a fuel cell stack including a 70 MPa high-pressure hydrogen tank, which can deliver a range of 435 mi (700 km) under the Japanese JC08 test cycle.
Toyota said the car was planned for launch in about 2015.
In August 2012, Toyota announced its plans to start retail sales of a hydrogen fuel-cell sedan in California in 2015.
Toyota expects to become a leader in this technology.
The prototype of its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle will be exhibited at the November 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, and in the United States at the January 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.
Toyota's first hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles to be sold commercially, the Toyota Mirai (Japanese for "future"), was unveiled at the November 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show.
In January 2015, it was announced that production of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle would increase from 700 units in 2015 to approximately 2,000 in 2016 and 3,000 in 2017.
Sales in Japan began on December 15, 2014, at a price of ¥6,700,000 (~US$57,400).
The Japanese government plans to support the commercialization of fuel-cell vehicles with a subsidy of ¥2,000,000 (~US$19,600).
Retail sales in the U.S. began in August 2015 at a price of US$57,500 before any government incentives.
Initially, the Mirai will only be available in California.
The market release in Europe is slated for September 2015, and initially will be available only in the UK, Germany, and Denmark, followed by other countries in 2017.
Pricing in Germany starts at €60,000 (~US$75,140) plus VAT (€78,540).
In 2015, Toyota released 5,600 patents for free use until 2020, hoping to promote global development of hydrogen fuel-cell technology.
Since the mid-2010s, Toyota has increased its focus on building hydrogen powered trucks.
It first showcased a heavy-duty semi-truck tractor in 2017 and in 2023 announced a kit to convert existing diesel-powered truck engines to use hydrogen.
In late 2022, the company signed an £11.3 million government deal with the UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to help it develop a hydrogen-powered Hilux pickup truck.
The Prius Plug-In Hybrid Concept was exhibited in late 2009, and shortly after, a global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began.
The vehicles were leased to fleet and government customers, and were equipped with data tracking devices to allow Toyota to monitor the car's performance.
The vehicle was based on the third-generation Toyota Prius and outfitted with two additional lithium-ion batteries beyond the normal hybrid battery pack.
The additional batteries were used to operate the car with minimal use of the internal combustion engine until they are depleted, at which point they are disengaged from the system.
They are not used in tandem with the main hybrid battery pack.
After the conclusion of the demonstration program, the production version of the Prius Plug-in Hybrid was unveiled in September 2011.
The production Prius Plug-in had a maximum electric-only speed of 100 km/h (62 mph), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the vehicle as having a range of 18 kilometres (11 mi) in blended mode (mostly electric, but supplemented by the internal combustion engine).
Toyota ultimately only did a small production run with 75,400 vehicles being produced between 2012 and 2016.
The second-generation Prius Plug-in (renamed the Prius Prime in the US) was unveiled in early 2016.
Unlike the prior generation, where the plug-in battery was limited by being added to the existing Prius, this model would be developed in tandem with the fourth-generation Prius, allowing Toyota to increase the range to 40 kilometres (25 mi), with a top speed of 135 km/h (84 mph), without needing the assistance of the internal combustion engine.
The second-generation Prius Plug-in went on sale starting in late 2016, with Toyota expecting to sell up to 60,000 units globally per year.
A second plug-in hybrid model, the Toyota RAV4 PHV (RAV4 Prime in the US) was unveiled in December 2019.
The vehicle has an EPA-estimated 68 kilometres (42 mi) of all-electric range and generates a combined 225 kilowatts (302 hp), enabling it to be Toyota's second fastest car currently in production (behind the GR Supra 3.0 sports car).
Sales started in mid-2020.
Toyota has been criticized for being slow to add battery electric vehicles to its lineup.
It has been publicly skeptical of battery-electric vehicles, instead focusing on hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and actively lobbying against government mandates to transition to zero-emissions vehicles.
As of 2023, only a small proportion of the vehicles the company sells are of battery electric, which has prompted criticism by some environmental and public interest groups.
The company plans to increase its sales of electric vehicles to 3.5 million per year by 2030.
However, the company has stated that it believes other technologies, including hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, will continue to play a role in the future of the company.
Toyota created the first generation Toyota RAV4 EV (Electric Vehicle) as a compliance car after the California Air Resources Board mandated in the late 1990s that every automaker offer a zero-emissions vehicle.
A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California from 1997 to 2003, when the state dropped its mandate under legal pressure from lawsuits filed by automakers.
A second generation of the RAV4 EV was developed in 2010 as part of a deal with Tesla.
The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from Tesla.
The RAV4 EV had a limited production run with just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.
According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was "marred by clashes between engineers".
Starting in 2009, Toyota introduced three generations of concept electric vehicles called the FT-EV built on a modified Toyota iQ platform.
In late-2012, the company announced plans build a production version of the car called the Toyota iQ EV (Scion iQ EV in the US, Toyota eQ in Japan), but ultimately production was cut back to 100 cars for special fleet use in Japan and the U.S. only.
A shift in Toyota's formerly battery-agnostic posture could be seen as early as 2016, when Toyota's CFO Takahiko Ijichi “sent a strong signal that Toyota soon plans to jump on the battery bandwagon and make electric cars despite expressing skeptical views about their range and charging times,” as the Wall Street Journal wrote.
Toyota said it would make and sell battery-electric vehicles if and where regulations and markets demand.
A year later, Toyota outlined its electric-vehicle plans for between 2020 and 2030 to the press in Tokyo, saying it would introduce "more than 10" battery-electric vehicles worldwide by the early 2020s, beginning in China, and later in Japan, Europe, the US and India.
In April 2019, Toyota introduced the C-HR EV, its first mass-produced pure electric model in China along with an identical twin called the IZOA EV.
It went on sale in April 2020 and May 2020 respectively.
Nikkei reported in October 2020 that Toyota had only sold less than 2,000 units in the first eight months of the year.
Toyota introduced the C+pod in late 2020, a 2-seater kei car with an estimated range of 100 kilometres (62 mi) and a top speed of 60 kilometres per hour (37 mph).
In December 2020, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda stated that electric cars are excessively "hyped" and that, in Japan, they would not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions since electricity is mostly generated by burning coal and natural gas in the country.
He also said that the infrastructure needed for Japan to switch fully to EVs would cost between $135 billion and $358 billion and switching only to EVs would cost millions of jobs and make cars less affordable.
In April 2021, Toyota revealed the bZ4X, an electric crossover SUV that will be the first vehicle built on a dedicated electric platform called e-TNGA when it goes on sale in mid-2022.
It is the first model of the bZ ("beyond Zero") series of battery electric vehicles.
The company has also stated that there will be seven "bZ" models to be launched globally out of 15 BEV models by 2025.
In December 2021, Toyota announced in Tokyo plans for 30 battery-electric models by 2030, to sell 3.5 million BEVs per year by that date, and that its premium-brand Lexus will be 100% battery-operated by 2030 in North America, Europe, and China.
The company announced investments of $70 billion into the company's electrification.
In a session in parallel with the G-7 Meeting 2023 May, Akio Toyoda said that battery electric vehicles are not solely the future, instead offering a mix of battery electric, internal combustion engine-equipped and hydrogen cars.
Toyota has been developing solid-state batteries in partnership with Panasonic, in which the company has more than a thousand patents covering solid-state batteries by late 2020.
The technology has been implemented on the Toyota LQ concept.
Toyota hopes the technology could increase efficiency of battery electric vehicles by 30 percent, which in turn would reduce battery costs by the same amount.
Toyota is also regarded as lagging when it comes to developing smart car technology.
Although the company unveiled its first self-driving test vehicle in 2017, and has been developing its own self-driving technology named "Chauffeur" (intended for full self-driving) and "Guardian" (a driver assist system), neither of these has been introduced into any production vehicles.
The company had set up a large research and development operation by 2018, spending almost US$4 billion to start an autonomous vehicle research institute in California's Silicon Valley and another ¥300 billion on a similar research institute in Tokyo that would partner with fellow Toyota Group companies and automotive suppliers Aisin Seiki and Denso.
In December 2020, Toyota showcased the 20-passenger "e-Palette" shared autonomous vehicle, which saw its first major use at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
Toyota has announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025.
Since February 2021, Toyota has been building the "Woven City" which it calls a "175-acre high tech, sensor-laden metropolis" at the foot of Mount Fuji.
When completed in 2024, the Woven City will be used to run tests on autonomous vehicles for deliveries, transport and mobile shops, with the city's residents participating in the living laboratory experiment.
Toyota has been involved in many global motorsports series, providing vehicles, engines and other auto parts under both the Toyota and Lexus brands.
Toyota Gazoo Racing (GR) is Toyota's performance brand that is used in many of the world's major motorsports contests.
Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe, based in Cologne, Germany, competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship, while the Finland-based Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT participates in the FIA World Rally Championship.
Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa competes in the Dakar Rally.
Between 2002 and 2009, the Toyota Racing team competed in Formula One.
Toyota won the highest class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans 5 consecutive times from 2018 to 2022, competing with the Toyota TS050 Hybrid and Toyota GR010 Hybrid.
Toyota Racing Development USA (TRD USA) is responsible for participation in major motorsports contests in the United States including NASCAR, NHRA, Indy Racing League and Formula Drift.
Toyota also makes engines and other auto parts for other Japanese motorsports including Super Formula, Super GT, Formula 3, and Toyota Racing Series.
Toyota is a minority shareholder in Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, having invested US$67.2 million in the new venture which will produce the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, slated for first deliveries in 2017.
Toyota has also studied participation in the general aviation market and contracted with Scaled Composites to produce a proof of concept aircraft, the TAA-1, in 2002.
In 1997, building on a previous partnership with Yamaha Marine, Toyota created "Toyota Marine", building private ownership motorboats, currently sold only in Japan.
A small network in Japan sells the luxury craft at 54 locations, called the "Toyota Ponam" series, and in 2017, a boat was labeled under the Lexus brand name starting May 26, 2017.
Toyota works with nonprofits to improve their processes and operations such as the Food Bank For New York City.
In 2004, Toyota showcased its trumpet-playing robot.
Toyota has been developing multitask robots destined for elderly care, manufacturing, and entertainment.
A specific example of Toyota's involvement in robotics for the elderly is the Brain Machine Interface.
Designed for use with wheelchairs, it "allows a person to control an electric wheelchair accurately, almost in real-time", with his or her mind.
The thought controls allow the wheelchair to go left, right, and forward with a delay between thought and movement of just 125 milliseconds.
Toyota also played a part in the development of Kirobo, a 'robotic astronaut'.
In 2017, the company introduced T-HR3, a humanoid robot with the ability to be remotely controlled.
The robot can copy the motions of a connected person.
The 2017 version used wires for the connection but the 2018 version used 5G from a distance up to 10 km (6.2 mi).
Aisin, another member of the Toyota Group of companies, uses the same Toyota wordmark logo to market its home-use sewing machines.
Aisin was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda after he founded the Toyota Motor Corporation.
According to Aisin, he was so pleased with the first sewing machine, he decided to apply the same Toyota branding as his auto business, despite the companies being independent from each other.
Toyota Ventures, along with JetBlue Technology Ventures and Parley for the Oceans, is among the corporate investors that have invested $40 million in the Air Company, a carbon negative vodka distiller and perfume and hand sanitizer manufacturer that uses heterogeneous catalysis to convert captured carbon into ethanol.
Toyota states it is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and it has set a goal to reduce its overall carbon emissions by 90% by 2050, compared to 2010 levels.
The company has invested heavily in solar energy, with a goal to install solar panels on the rooftops of all its dealerships worldwide by 2050.
In addition, Toyota has partnered with various renewable energy companies to promote the use of wind and solar power, including a recent partnership with ENEOS Corporation to develop hydrogen refueling stations in Japan.
Toyota has launched a program called "Global Environmental Challenge" 2050 which is a comprehensive initiative aimed at reducing the environmental impact of Toyota's operations.
The challenge includes six environmental goals that Toyota aims to achieve by 2050, including reducing carbon emissions, minimizing water usage, promoting the recycling and reuse of materials, and promoting the use of renewable energy.
The company has also implemented a variety of initiatives to promote sustainability across its supply chain, including efforts to reduce waste, water usage, and promote sustainable agriculture.
For example, Toyota has implemented a zero-waste initiative at its manufacturing plants, aiming to send zero waste to landfills.
In November 2016, Toyota agreed to pay $3.4 billion to settle allegations that roughly one-and-a-half million of its Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia pickup trucks and SUVs had been outfitted with frames prone to corrosion and perforation.
According to court papers, the corrosion could reach levels high enough to compromise the vehicle's structural integrity.
On February 9, 2002, Kenichi Uchino, aged 30 years, a quality control manager, collapsed then died at work.
On January 2, 2006, an unnamed chief engineer of the Camry Hybrid, aged 45 years, died from heart failure in his bed.
In 2003, Toyota was fined $34 million for violating the United States Clean Air Act, as 2.2 million vehicles it sold had defective smog-control computers.
In January 2021, Toyota was fined $180 million for delays in reporting emissions-related defects to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 2005 and 2015.
The acting U.S. attorney said that the delays "likely led to delayed or avoided emissions-related recalls", although Toyota stated that despite the delays in reporting the issues to the EPA, it had notified customers and fixed the cars with the emissions defects.
At the time, this was the biggest civil penalty ever levied for violating the EPA's emission reporting requirements.
Between 2009 and 2011 Toyota, under pressure from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration.
The first recall, in November 2009, was to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped.
The second recall, in January 2010, was begun after some crashes were shown not to have been caused by floor mats and may be caused by possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.
Worldwide, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were impacted by the recalls.
NHTSA received reports of a total of 37 deaths allegedly related to unintended acceleration, although an exact number was never verified.
As a result of the problems, Toyota faced nearly 100 lawsuits from the families of those killed, drivers who were injured, vehicle owners who lost resale value, and investors who saw a drop in the value of their shares.
While most of the personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits were settled confidentially, Toyota did spend more than US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value, and the company agreed to pay a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects from the public and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image.
The penalty was the largest ever levied against a car company.
Toyota was impacted by a recall of faulty airbag inflators made by Takata.
The inflators can explode, shooting metal fragments into the vehicle cabin.
Millions of vehicles produced between 2000 and 2014 were impacted by the recall, with some needing multiple repairs.
As of January 2024, over 100 million Takata air bag inflators worldwide have been recalled by more than 20 carmakers.
On June 21, 2010, a Chinese labor strike happened in Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Co, Tianjin.
Workers demanded better wages and treatment.
In 2015, U.S. officials asked Toyota how the Islamic State was in possession of so many Toyota trucks.
Toyota cars have also been documented to have been used by other extremist organizations such as the Taliban, Hamas, Al-shabab and Somali pirates.
Toyota representatives have said the company has a strict policy of to not sell vehicles to potential purchasers who may use or modify them for paramilitary or terrorist activities and that it cannot track aftermarket sales and that it has worked with the U.S Treasury to brief them on Toyota's supply chain on the Middle East.
Electric vehicle website IrishEVs criticised Toyota Ireland for paying University College Dublin to conduct a study of only seven examples of their hybrid cars over seven days to make a press release about the efficiency of the vehicles.
The website also criticised Toyota Ireland for using opinion polls to substantiate a claim about their CO2 emissions on Twitter.
In April 2023, it was revealed that Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu had cheated by rigging some models to perform better in crash tests than actual production cars.
The vehicles in question had a notch in the interior panel of the front door which avoided the possibility of the collision creating a sharp edge that could have injured an occupant when the side airbag deployed.
This notch was present on the tested vehicles but not on vehicles sold to the public.
The issue affected four models, the Toyota Yaris Ativ (also known as the Vios), Perodua Axia, Toyota Agya, and an undisclosed upcoming product.
No recall was conducted over the issue.
In December 2023, Daihatsu halted shipments of 64 models, including two dozens branded as Toyota, after safety investigations uncovered misconduct far greater in scope than previously expected.
In some models, the test speeds and results of headrest impact tests were falsified.
In models such as the TownAce and Pixis Joy, the airbag control unit used in testing was different from the part installed on vehicles sold to the public.
Affected markets included Japan as well as Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam.
On 29 January 2024, Koji Sato publicly apologized to customers, dealers and suppliers for the flawed testing.
Toyota is headquartered in the city of Toyota, which was named Koromo until 1951, when it changed its name to match the automaker.
Toyota City is located in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan.
The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a four-story building that has been described as "modest".
In 2013, company CEO Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters due to the lack of amenities in the city.
Surrounding the headquarters are the 14-story Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha plant (which was established in 1938).
Toyota and its Toyota Group affiliates operate a total of 17 manufacturing facilities in Aichi Prefecture and a total of 32 plants in Japan.
Toyota also operates offices in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and Nakamura-ku, Nagoya.
Outside of Japan, as one of the world's largest automotive manufacturer by production volume, Toyota has factories in most parts of the world.
The company assembles vehicles in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.
Additionally, the company also has joint venture, licensed, or contract factories in China, France, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, the United States, and Vietnam.
Toyota Motor North America is headquartered in Plano, Texas, and operates as a holding company for all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
Toyota's operations in North America began on October 31, 1957, and the current company was established in 2017 from the consolidation of three companies: Toyota Motor North America, Inc., which controlled Toyota's corporate functions; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. which handled marketing, sales, and distribution in the United States; and Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America which oversaw operations at all assembly plants in the region.
While all three companies continue to exist in legal name, they operate as one company out of one headquarters campus.
Toyota has a large presence in the United States with six major assembly plants in Huntsville, Alabama, Georgetown, Kentucky, Princeton, Indiana, San Antonio, Texas, Buffalo, West Virginia, and Blue Springs, Mississippi.
In 2018, Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture plant that will produce vehicles in Huntsville, Alabama, starting in 2021.
It has started producing larger trucks, such as the new Tundra, to go after the full-size pickup market in the United States.
Toyota is also pushing hybrid electric vehicle in the US such as the Prius, Camry Hybrid, Highlander Hybrid, and various Lexus products.
Toyota never introduced diesel motor options in its North American products, including pickup trucks.
Toyota Canada Inc., which is part of Toyota Motor North America, handles marketing, sales, and distribution in Canada.
Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada operates three assembly plants: two in Cambridge, Ontario and one in Woodstock, Ontario.
In 2006, Toyota's subsidiary Hino Motors opened a heavy duty truck plant, also in Woodstock, employing 45 people and producing 2,000 trucks annually.
Toyota Motor Europe is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, and oversees all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Europe and western Asia.
Toyota's operations in Europe began in 1963.
Toyota has a significant presence in Europe with nine production facilities in Kolín, Czech Republic, Burnaston, England, Deeside, England, Onnaing, France, Jelcz-Laskowice, Poland, Wałbrzych, Poland, Ovar, Portugal, Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Arifiye, Turkey.
Toyota also operates a joint venture plant with Citroën and Peugeot in Valenciennes, France.
In 1963, Australia was one of the first countries to assemble Toyotas outside Japan.
However, in February 2014, Toyota was the last of Australia's major automakers to announce the end of production in Australia.
The closure of Toyota's Australian plant was completed on October 3, 2017, and had produced a total 3,451,155 vehicles.
At its peak in October 2007, Toyota manufactured 15,000 cars a month.
Before Toyota, Ford and GM's Holden had announced similar moves, all citing an unfavorable currency and attendant high manufacturing costs.
The Toyota Way is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the company's approach to management and production (which is further defined as the Toyota Production System).
The company has been developing its corporate philosophy since 1948 and passing it on as implicit knowledge to new employees, but as the company expanded globally, leaders officially identified and defined the Toyota Way in 2001.
Toyota summarized it under two main pillars: continuous improvement and respect for people.
Under the continuous improvement pillar are three principles: challenge (form a long-term vision), kaizen (a continual improvement process), and genchi genbutsu ("go and see" the process to make correct decisions).
Under the respect for people pillar are two principles: respect and teamwork.
In 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a University of Michigan professor of industrial engineering, published The Toyota Way.
In his book, Liker calls the Toyota Way "a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work."
According to Liker, there are 14 principles of The Toyota Way that can be organized into four themes: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning.
The 14 principles are further defined in the Wikipedia article on The Toyota Way.
The Toyota Way also helped shape the company's approach to production, where it was an early pioneer of what would become known as lean manufacturing.
The company defines the Toyota Production System under two main pillars: just-in-time (make only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed) and Jidoka (automation with a human touch).
The origin of the Toyota Production System is in dispute, with three stories of its origin: (1) that during a 1950 trip to train with the Ford Motor Company, company executives also studied the just-in-time distribution system of the grocery store company Piggly-Wiggly, (2) that they followed the writings of W. Edwards Deming, and (3) they learned the principles from a WWII US government training program (Training Within Industry).
After developing the Toyota Production System in its own facilities, the company began teaching the system to its parts suppliers in the 1990s.
Other companies were interested in the instruction, and Toyota later started offering training sessions.
The company also has donated the training to non-profit groups to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people.
In 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line.
After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to "Toyota" from the family name "Toyoda", which means rice paddy.
The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune.
The original logo was a heavily stylized version of the katakana characters for Toyota (トヨタ).
Toyota introduced a worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand.
The logo consists of three ovals that combine to form the letter "T", which stands for Toyota.
Toyota says that the overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the "global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future".
The new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most vehicles in 1990.
In countries or regions using traditional Chinese characters, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as "豐田".
In countries using simplified Chinese characters (e.g. China and Singapore), Toyota is written as "丰田" (pronounced as Fēngtián in Mandarin Chinese and Hɔng Tshan in Minnanese).
These are the same characters as the founding family's name "Toyoda" in Japanese.
Toyota still uses the katakana character logo as its corporate emblem in Japan, including on the headquarters building, and some special edition models still use the "TOYOTA" wordmark on the grille as a nod to the company's heritage.
On July 15, 2015, the company was delegated its own generic top-level domain, .toyota.
As of 2017, Toyota is an official sponsor of Cricket Australia, the England and Wales Cricket Board and the AFL.
In March 2015, Toyota became a sponsor partner for the Olympic Games, in the form of supplying vehicles and communications between vehicles.
In May 2024, Toyota announced that it will not be extending the contract after the 2024 games in Paris, but hopes to retain its contract as a top sponsor with the International Paralympic Committee.
Toyota had previously sponsored football clubs Valencia (2003–2008), Fiorentina (1999–2002 and 2004–2010), Perugia (2002–2004), Catania (2003–2004) and Valenciennes (2005–2012).
Truck classifications are typically based upon the maximum loaded weight of the truck, typically using the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and sometimes also the gross trailer weight rating (GTWR), and can vary among jurisdictions.
In the United States, commercial truck classification is determined based on the vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR).
The classes are numbered 1 through 8.
Trucks are also classified more broadly by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which groups classes 1 and 2 as light duty, 3 through 6 as medium duty, and 7 and 8 as heavy duty.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a separate system of emissions classifications for trucks.
The United States Census Bureau also assigned classifications in its now-discontinued Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey (VIUS) (formerly Truck Inventory and Use Survey (TIUS)).
United States federal law requires drivers to have a commercial driver's license (CDL) to operate heavy-duty vehicles (Class 7 and 8) in commerce, with the exception of emergency vehicles and vehicles strictly used for recreational and/or agricultural purposes, though it allows states to require a CDL for these vehicles under their discretion.
A CDL is also required to operate any vehicle that transports at least 16 passengers (including the driver) or hazardous materials requiring placards under federal and state law regardless of the weight of the vehicle.
States may extend CDL requirements for additional vehicles, for example, New York requires a CDL to operate a stretched limousine and California requires a CDL for any vehicle with three or more axles that has a gross vehicle weight rating of over 6,000 pounds.
When light-duty trucks were first produced in the United States, they were rated by their payload capacity in tons: 1⁄2 (1000 pounds), 3⁄4 (1500 pounds) and 1-ton (2000 pounds).
Ford had introduced the "One-Tonner" in 1938 to their line of trucks.
The "Three-quarter-tonner" appeared in the Ford truck lineup in 1939.
Over time, payload capacities for most domestic pickup trucks have increased while the ton titles have stayed the same.
The 1948 Ford F-1 had a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 4700 pounds.
The truck was marketed with a "Nominal Tonnage Rating: Half-Ton."
The actual cargo capacity had increased to 1450 pounds.
Ford adopted this promotional nomenclature in 1948 to assist buyers, sellers, and users.
The now-imprecise ton rating has continued since the post World War II era to compare standard sizes, rather than actual capacities.
In 1975, a change in U.S. emission laws required any vehicle under 6000 pounds GVWR to burn unleaded fuel.
U.S. pickup truck manufacturers responded with a "heavy half" pickup of over 6000 pounds GVWR.
The F-150 had a capacity of over 2000 pounds, compared to 1500 pounds for the F-100.
This has led to categorizing trucks similarly, even if their payload capacities are different.
The Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra 1500, Ford F-150, Nissan Titan, Ram 1500, and Toyota Tundra are called "half-ton" pickups (1⁄2-ton).
The Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra 2500, Ford F-250, and Ram 2500 are called "three-quarter-ton" pickups.
The Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra 3500, Ford F-350, and Ram 3500 are known as "one ton" pickups.
Similar schemes exist for vans and SUVs (e.g. a 1-ton Dodge Van or a 1⁄2-ton GMC Suburban), medium duty trucks (e.g. the 11⁄2-ton Ford F-550) and some military vehicles, like the ubiquitous deuce-and-a-half.
Some pickup trucks may be marketed as heavy duty (eg Ram Heavy Duty), super duty (eg Ford Super Duty) or simply "HD".
This is not to be confused with the truck classification of class 7 and 8 being heavy duty.
The Class 8 truck gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is a vehicle with a GVWR exceeding 33000 lb (14969 kg).
These include tractor trailer tractors, single-unit dump trucks of a GVWR over 33,000 lb, as well as non-commercial chassis fire trucks; such trucks typically have 3 or more axles.
The typical 5-axle tractor-trailer combination, also called a "semi" or "18-wheeler", is a Class 8 vehicle.
Standard trailers vary in length from 8 ft (2.4 m) containers to 57 ft (17 m) van trailers, with the most common length being the 53 ft (16 m) trailer.
Specialized trailers for oversized loads can be considerably longer.
Commercial operation of a Class 8 vehicle in the United States requires either a Class-B CDL for non-combination vehicles, or a Class-A CDL for combination vehicles (tractor-trailers).
Vehicle categories on a European driving licence include (among others) B for general motor vehicles, C for large goods vehicles, D for large passenger vehicles (buses), and are limited by the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating and number of passenger seats.
appending the number 1 to the licence class C or D denotes the "light" versions of said class (e.g., Minibus, or medium truck).
appending the letter E allows for trailers of larger Gross Trailer Weight Rating (GTWR) than permitted by the standard licence category.
For the "trailer" categories, a separate driving test is generally required (e.g., "C", and "CE" require separate tests).
The classifications used on the International Driving Permit are similar to the European model.
Unlike pneumatic tires which use a separate inner tube, tubeless tires have continuous ribs molded integrally into the bead of the tire that are forced by air pressure into a flange on the metal rim of the wheel, sealing the tire to the rim.
Many patents had been filed covering tubeless tires.
Killen Tire applied for a patent in 1928 and was granted GB patent 329955  in the UK in 1930.
The Wingfoot Corporation, a subsidiary of Goodyear Tire were granted a patent in South Africa in 1944.
Due to technical problems, most of these designs saw only limited production or were abandoned.
Frank Herzegh working for BF Goodrich applied for a patent in 1946 and eventually received US patent 2587470  in 1952 in the United States.
By 1955 tubeless tires became standard equipment on new cars.
BF Goodrich had to defend their patent in court several times, due to the similarities of previous designs.
The primary difference between the BF Goodrich design and their predecessors was the usage of butyl rubber, which was more resistant to air leakage than the natural rubber used in the other designs.
Traditional designs of pneumatic tires required a separate inner tube which could fail for a number of reasons, such as incorrect tire fit, friction between the tire wall and inner tube generating excess heat, or a puncture.
Tubeless tire technology does away with the need for an inner tube thereby increasing safety.
In a tubeless tire, the tire and the rim of the wheel form an airtight seal, with the valve being directly mounted on the rim.
If a tubeless tire gets a small puncture, air escapes only through the hole, leading to a gentle deflation.
Conversely, a tubed tire, with an inner tube, could burst like a balloon, leading to deflation of the tire which could result in sudden loss of control of the vehicle.
However, the "bursting like a balloon" scenario is highly unlikely due to fact that the inner tube is inside of the tire and will deflate at a rate proportional to the puncture hole size.
In antique automobiles, made before the mid 1950s, the rims are not designed for tubeless tires, and an inner tube is required to prevent slow leaks at the bead.
Tubeless tires provide several advantages, such as remaining operational at lower air pressure even when the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) shows a warning.
Due to their high width, tubeless tires are less likely to get punctured than regular tube tires.
Air leakage is also reduced as the rubber in the tire keeps the air trapped for longer, giving you extra time to drive safely and pull over.
In addition, mending a tubeless tire is easier than a traditional one--a simple liquid sealant poured over the puncture is often enough to patch it.
Furthermore, the higher air pressure inside a tubeless tire provides more stability and comfort while driving.
Lastly, the lack of a tube also boosts fuel efficiency due to reduced tire friction.
Liquid tire sealant can be injected into tubeless tires to prevent deflation in case of small punctures, although there is controversy regarding its compatibility with direct tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) that employ sensors mounted inside the tire.
Some manufacturers of sealants assert that their products are indeed compatible,  but others warned that, e.g., the "sealant may come in contact with the sensor in a way that renders the sensor TEMPORARILY inoperable until it is properly cleaned, inspected and re-installed by a tire care professional".
Such doubts are also reported by others.
Use of such sealants may void the TPMS sensor warranty.
A tubeless bicycle tire system requires a compatible tire, an airtight rim—capable of being sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they go all the way through the rim) and the tire bead seat.
Liquid sealant is added inside the tire to prevent leaking around the bead and to seal holes from small punctures, but the sealant can be messy to mount or in case of punctures.
Tubeless systems typically utilize Presta valves with removable cores.
Some feature a larger internal diameter than usual Presta valves to prevent clogging and to accommodate more air flow during installation.
The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.
Lower pressures mean improved comfort and rolling performance on rough surfaces.
Since there’s no inner tube, there’s no friction between tire and tube.
Many punctures will self seal.
Most punctures that don’t seal are easy to fix with a  tire plug.
UST or Universal System Tubeless is a US patent 6257676  rim designed by Mavic with hooked edges designed to seal with specially designed tires.
Several companies such as Michelin and Hutchinson make tires compatible with UST rims, and that.
UST was the first tubeless system for bicycles.
Other companies such as Stan’s NoTubes, Bontrager, DT Swiss, and WTB have their own similar system called Tubeless Ready.
In 2006, Shimano and Hutchinson introduced a tubeless system for road bicycles.
There has been a slow migration of the professional peloton to tubeless designs, with the change happening slowly over the later end of the 2010's with tubeless turning up on a meaningful number of bikes around the 2017 season and continuing to gain popularity into the early 2020's.
As of 2024, most of the professional peloton is now using a tubeless setup for most applications with the odd UCI pro team using tubular or clinchers in certain races or stages.
Tubeless tyres now dominate the lowest rolling resistance charts.
Toyota Motor Corporation (Japanese: トヨタ自動車株式会社, Hepburn: Toyota Jidōsha kabushikigaisha, IPA: [toꜜjota], English: , commonly known as simply Toyota) is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi, Japan.
It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937.
Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.
The company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father.
Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world.
While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.
After World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.
In the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.
The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of December 2020.
Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle.
By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.
As of 2024, the Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under four brands: Daihatsu, Hino, Lexus and the namesake Toyota.
The company also holds a 20% stake in Subaru Corporation, a 5.1% stake in Mazda, a 4.9% stake in Suzuki, a 4.6% stake in Isuzu, a 3.8% stake in Yamaha Motor Corporation, and a 2.8% stake in Panasonic, as well as stakes in vehicle manufacturing joint-ventures in China (FAW Toyota and GAC Toyota), the Czech Republic (TPCA), India (Toyota Kirloskar) and the United States (MTMUS).
Toyota is listed on the London Stock Exchange, Nagoya Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where its stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.
In 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic loom.
The principle of jidoka, which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System.
Looms were built on a small production line.
In 1929, the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers, generating the starting capital for automobile development.
Under the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established an Automobile Division on September 1, 1933, and formally declared its intention to begin manufacturing automobiles on January 29, 1934.
A prototype Toyota Type A engine was completed on September 25, 1934, with the company's first prototype sedan, the A1, completed the following May.
As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.
Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for ¥2,900, ¥200 cheaper than the Ford truck.
A total of 379 G1 trucks were ultimately produced.
In April 1936, Toyoda's first passenger car, the Model AA, was completed.
The sales price was ¥3,350, ¥400 cheaper than Ford or GM cars.
The company's plant at Kariya was completed in May.
In July, the company filled its first export order, with four G1 trucks exported to northeastern China.
On September 19, 1936, the Japanese imperial government officially designated Toyota Automatic Loom Works as an automotive manufacturer.
Vehicles were originally sold under the name "Toyoda" (トヨダ), from the family name of the company's founder, Kiichirō Toyoda.
In September 1936, the company ran a public competition to design a new logo.
Of 27,000 entries, the winning entry was the three Japanese katakana letters for "Toyoda" in a circle.
However, Rizaburo Toyoda, who had married into the family and was not born with that name, preferred "Toyota" (トヨタ) because it took eight brush strokes (a lucky number) to write in Japanese, was visually simpler (leaving off the diacritic at the end), and with a voiceless consonant instead of a voiced one (voiced consonants are considered to have a "murky" or "muddy" sound compared to voiceless consonants, which are "clear").
Since toyoda literally means "fertile rice paddies", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming.
The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd.
Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president.
Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.
The Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.
At the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.
Japan was heavily damaged in World War II and Toyota's plants, which were used for the war effort, were not spared.
On August 14, 1945, one day before the surrender of Japan, Toyota's Koromo Plant was bombed by the Allied forces.
After the surrender, the U.S.-led occupying forces banned passenger car production in Japan.
However, automakers like Toyota were allowed to begin building trucks for civilian use, in an effort to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.
The U.S. military also contracted with Toyota to repair its vehicles.
By 1947, there was an emerging global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., who had been allies in World War II.
U.S. priorities shifted (the "Reverse Course") from punishing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the economy, and, to an extent, remilitarizing Japan.
Under these new policies, in 1949, Japanese automakers were allowed to resume passenger car production, but at the same time, a new economic stabilization program to control inflation plunged the automotive industry into a serious shortage of funds, while many truck owners defaulted on their loans.
Ultimately, the Bank of Japan, the central bank of the country, bailed out the company, with demands that the company institute reforms.
As the 1950s began, Toyota emerged from its financial crisis a smaller company, closing factories and laying off workers.
Meanwhile, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota.
The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company's business performance.
In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers.
The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.
Toyota started developing its first full-fledged passenger car, the Toyopet Crown, in 1952.
Prior to the Crown, Toyota had been outsourcing the design and manufacturing of auto bodies, which were then mounted on truck frames made by Toyota.
The project was a major test for Toyota, who would need to build bodies and develop a new chassis that would be comfortable, but still stand up to the muddy, slow, unpaved roads common in Japan at the time.
The project had been championed for many years by founder Kiichiro Toyoda, who died suddenly on March 27, 1952.
The first prototypes were completed in June 1953 and began extensive testing, before the Crown went on sale in August 1955.
The car was met with positive reviews from around the world.
After the introduction of the Crown, Toyota began aggressively expanding into the export market; the company entered Saudi Arabia for the first time in 1955 with Land Cruisers, following an agreement reached with Abdul Latif Jameel (founder of his company of the same name); Toyota also brought Land Cruisers into neighboring Yemen in 1956.
In 1958, Toyota established a production facility in Brazil, the company's first outside of Japan.
Toyota entered the United States market in 1958, attempting to sell the Toyopet Crown.
The company faced problems almost immediately, the Crown was a flop in the U.S. with buyers finding it overpriced and underpowered (because it was designed for the bad roads of Japan, not high-speed performance).
In response, exports of the Crown to the United States were suspended in the early 1960s in favor of the Land Cruiser and the Tiara.
After Kiichiro's death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades.
Eiji helped establish the company's first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.
At the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle.
As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle.
At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure.
To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.
Toyota also found success in the United States in 1965 with the Toyota Corona compact car, which was redesigned specifically for the American market with a more powerful engine.
The Corona helped increase U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase) and helped the company become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967.
Toyota's first manufacturing investment in the United States came in 1972 when the company struck a deal with Atlas Fabricators, to produce truck beds in Long Beach, in an effort to avoid the 25% "chicken tax" on imported light trucks.
By importing the truck as an incomplete chassis cab (the truck without a bed), the vehicle only faced a 4% tariff.
Once in the United States, Atlas would build the truck beds and attach them to the trucks.
The partnership was successful and two years later, Toyota purchased Atlas.
The energy crisis of the 1970s was a major turning point in the American auto industry.
Before the crisis, large and heavy vehicles with powerful but inefficient engines were common.
But in the years after, consumers started demanding high-quality and fuel-efficient small cars.
Domestic automakers, in the midst of their malaise era, struggled to build these cars profitably, but foreign automakers like Toyota were well positioned.
This, along with growing anti-Japanese sentiment, prompted the U.S. Congress to consider import restrictions to protect the domestic auto industry.
The 1960s also saw the slight opening of the Japanese auto market to foreign companies.
In an effort to strengthen Japan's auto industry ahead of the market opening, Toyota purchased stakes in other Japanese automakers.
That included a stake in Hino Motors, a manufacturer of large commercial trucks, buses and diesel engines, along with a 16.8 percent stake in Daihatsu, a manufacturer of kei cars, the smallest highway-legal passenger vehicles sold in Japan.
That began what became a long-standing partnership between Toyota and the two companies.
As part of the partnership, Daihatsu would supply kei cars for Toyota to sell and to a lesser extent Toyota would supply full-sized cars for Daihatsu to sell (a process known as rebadging), allowing both companies to sell a full line-up of vehicles.
After the successes of the 1970s, and the threats of import restrictions, Toyota started making additional investments in the North American market in the 1980s.
In 1981, Japan agreed to voluntary export restraints, which limited the number of vehicles the nation would send to the United States each year, leading Toyota to establish assembly plants in North America.
The U.S. government also closed the loophole that allowed Toyota to pay lower taxes by building truck beds in America.
Also in 1981, Eiji Toyoda stepped down as president and assumed the title of chairman.
He was succeeded as president by Shoichiro Toyoda, the son of the company's founder.
Within months, Shoichiro started to merge Toyota's sales and production organizations, and in 1982 the combined companies became the Toyota Motor Corporation.
The two groups were described as "oil and water" and it took years of leadership from Shoichiro to successfully combine them into one organization.
In Japan, Toyota offered mid-level luxury cars that were a class below the Crown and Century and offered hardtop coupes and sedans.
The Supra, Mark II, Cresta and Chaser offered several trim packages with different engine displacements to provide buyers with annual road tax advantages.
At the same time, sports cars like Celica, Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno sold very well.
Efforts to open a Toyota assembly plant in the United States started in 1980, with the company proposing a joint-venture with the Ford Motor Company.
Those talks broke down in July 1981.
Eventually in 1984, the company struck a deal with General Motors (GM) to establish a joint-venture vehicle manufacturing plant called NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.) in Fremont, California.
GM saw the joint venture as a way to get access to a quality small car and an opportunity to learn about The Toyota Way and the Toyota Production System.
For Toyota, the factory gave the company its first manufacturing base in North America allowing it to avoid any future tariffs on imported vehicles and saw GM as a partner who could show them how to navigate the American labor environment.
The plant would be led by Tatsuro Toyoda, the younger brother of company president Shoichiro Toyoda.
The first Toyota assembled in America, a white Corolla, rolled off the line at NUMMI on October 7, 1986.
Toyota received its first Japanese Quality Control Award at the start of the 1980s and began participating in a wide variety of motorsports.
Conservative Toyota held on to rear-wheel-drive designs for longer than most; while a clear first in overall production they were only third in production of front-wheel-drive cars in 1983, behind Nissan and Honda.
In part due to this, Nissan's Sunny managed to squeeze by the Corolla in numbers built that year.
Before the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in international markets.
Prior to the debut of Lexus, Toyota's two existing flagship models, the Crown and Century, both catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar.
The company had been developing the brand and vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.
The LS 400 flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.
In the 1990s, Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup, including a full-sized pickup, the T100 (and later the Tundra), several lines of SUVs, a sport version of the Camry, known as the Camry Solara.
They would also launch newer iterations of their sports cars, namely the MR2, Celica, and Supra during this era.
In Japan, Toyota continued to cater to the growing demand for mid-level luxury cars and offered several conventional and pillared hardtops sedans at its Japanese dealership network.
The Soarer, Mark II, Cresta, Chaser, Corona EXiV, and Carina ED found many buyers.
At the same time, sports cars like the Supra, Celica, MR2, Corolla Levin, Sprinter Trueno, and even the subcompact Starlet GT reflected a time of prosperity.
December 1997 saw the introduction of the first-generation Toyota Prius, the first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car.
The vehicle would be produced exclusively for the Japanese market for the first two years.
With a major presence in Europe, due to the success of Toyota Team Europe in motorsport, the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering, TMME, to help market vehicles in the continent.
Two years later, Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom, TMUK, as the company's cars had become very popular among British drivers.
Bases in Indiana, Virginia, and Tianjin were also set up.
Toyota also increased its ownership of Daihatsu during this period.
In 1995, Toyota increased its shareholding in the company to 33.4 percent, giving Toyota the ability to veto shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting.
In 1998, Toyota increased its holding in the company to 51.2 percent, becoming the majority shareholder.
On September 29, 1999, the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges.
The later half of the 1990s would also see the Toyoda brothers step back from the company their father had founded.
In 1992, Shoichiro Toyoda would shift to become chairman, allowing his brother Tatsuro to become president, a job he held until his retirement in 1995.
Shoichiro would step down as chairman in 1999.
Both would retain honorary advisory roles in the company.
Hiroshi Okuda would lead the company as president from 1995 until 1999 when he became chairman and the President's office would be filled by Fujio Cho.
In August 2000, exports began of the Prius.
In 2001, Toyota acquired its long time partner, truck and bus manufacturer Hino Motors.
In 2002, Toyota entered Formula One competition and established a manufacturing joint venture in France with French automakers Citroën and Peugeot.
A youth-oriented marque for North America, Scion, was introduced in 2003.
Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world's leading companies for the year 2005.
Also in 2005, Fujio Cho would shift to become chairman of Toyota and would be replaced as president by Katsuaki Watanabe.
In 2007, Toyota released an update of its full-sized truck, the Tundra, produced in two American factories, one in Texas and one in Indiana.
Motor Trend named the 2007 Toyota Camry "Car of the Year" for 2007.
It also began the construction of two new factories, one in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and the other in Blue Springs, Mississippi, USA.
The company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008.
Toyota was hit by the global financial crisis of 2008 as it was forced in December 2008 to forecast its first annual loss in 70 years.
In January 2009, it announced the closure of all of its Japanese plants for 11 days to reduce output and stocks of unsold vehicles.
In October 2009, Toyota announced that they were establishing an office in South Korea and launched the Camry sedan, Camry hybrid, Prius and the RAV4 during the launching event at the Grand Hyatt Seoul.
Between 2009 and 2011, Toyota conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration.
The recalls were to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped and to correct the possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.
At least 37 were killed in crashes allegedly related to unintended acceleration, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were recalled, Toyota was sued for personal injuries and wrongful deaths, paid US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value, and paid a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image.
Amid the unintended acceleration scandal, Katsuaki Watanabe stepped down as company president.
He was replaced by Akio Toyoda, grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda, on June 23, 2009.
Akio had been with Toyota since 1984, working jobs in production, marketing and product development, and took a seat on the board of directors in 2000.
Akio's promotion by the board marked the return of a member of the Toyoda family to the top leadership role for the first time since 1999.
In 2011, Toyota, along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry, suffered from a series of natural disasters.
The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a severe disruption of the supplier base and a drop in production and exports.
Severe flooding during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand affected Japanese automakers that had chosen Thailand as a production base.
Toyota is estimated to have lost production of 150,000 units to the tsunami and production of 240,000 units to the floods.
On February 10, 2014, it was announced that Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia by the end of 2017.
The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture, and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.
The company planned to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017, and retain its Altona plant for other functions.
The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.
Both Ford Motor Company and General Motors (Holden) followed suit, ending Australian production in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
The automaker narrowly topped global sales for the first half of 2014, selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending June 30, 2014, an increase of 3.8% on the same period the previous year.
Volkswagen AG, which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles, was close behind.
In August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its spare-parts prices in China by up to 35%.
The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China's National Development and Reform Commission of Toyota's Lexus spare-parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales servicing.
In November 2015, the company announced that it would invest US$1 billion over the next 5 years into artificial intelligence and robotics research.
In 2016, Toyota invested in Uber.
In 2020, a corporate governance report showed that Toyota owns 10.25 million shares of Uber, which was valued at $292.46 million as of March 30, 2020.
According to Reuters, this was roughly 0.6 per cent of Uber's outstanding shares.
In March 2016, Toyota partnered with Yanmar to create a fiberglass pleasure boat using Yanmar outboard marine diesel engines or Toyota inboard engines.
In August 2016, the company purchased all remaining assets of Daihatsu, making the manufacturer of small cars a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.
On August 27, 2018, Toyota announced an investment of US$500 million in Uber's autonomous cars.
In October 2019, Toyota backed the Trump Administration's proposal that federal authority should override California's ability to set its own emissions standards for automobiles.
The proposal would reduce California's 2025 fuel efficiency standard from about 54.5 to 37 MPG.
This shift by Toyota away from fuel efficiency damaged the company's reputation as a green brand.
By 2020, Toyota reclaimed its position as the largest automaker in the world, surpassing Volkswagen.
It sold 9.528 million vehicles globally despite an 11.3% drop in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This includes subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors.
In March 2021, Toyota, its subsidiary Hino, and Isuzu announced the creation of a strategic partnership between the three companies.
Toyota acquired a 4.6% stake in Isuzu while the latter plans to acquire Toyota shares for an equivalent value.
The three companies said they would form a new joint venture by April called Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation with the aim of developing fuel cell and electric light trucks.
Toyota would own an 80% stake in the venture while Hino and Isuzu would own 10% each.
In April 2021, Toyota said that it will buy Lyft's self-driving technology unit for $550 million and merge it with its newly created Woven Planet Holdings automation division.
In June 2021, the company defended its donations to the United States Republican lawmakers after they voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying it did not believe it was "appropriate to judge members of Congress" for that one vote.
A report by Axios found that Toyota was the top donor to 2020 election objectors, by a substantial margin.
The company then reversed course in July 2021 and ceased donations to election objectors, releasing a statement saying it understood that its PAC's donations to those objectors, which far outpaced those of any other company, "troubled some stakeholders."
Toyota resumed donations after a six-month pause.
In December 2021, Toyota announced that it would invest ¥8,000,000,000,000 ($70 billion at 2021 exchange rate) in electric vehicles by 2030, launch 30 EV models worldwide by that year, and set a sales target of 3.5 million electric vehicles in 2030.
Toyota will increase its software engineer intake to around 40% to 50% of all technical hires from the second quarter of 2022, the move plans to address a transformation to so-called CASE — connected, autonomous, shared and electric — technologies in an environment of intensifying global competition.
In 2021, Toyota told some of its suppliers to increase their semiconductor inventory levels from the conventional three months to five months in response to the COVID-19 chip shortage.
The "just-in-time" supply chain in which parts are only delivered when necessary, had already been revised after the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami in Japan, lifting inventories across the entire procurement network.
The time it takes Toyota to turn over its inventory increased by around 40% during the past ten years, to 36.36 days as of March 2021.
In June 2022, Toyota recalled 2,700 of its first mass-produced all-electric vehicles due to worries that their wheels could fall off during driving.
It was discovered that the bolts on the bZ4X's wheels could loosen up to the point where the wheel simply detaches from the car, causing a loss of control over the vehicle and possible accident.
In August 2022, Toyota pledged up to $5.6 billion towards production of electric vehicle battery production and announced an increase in investment in its plant near Greensboro, North Carolina.
Also in 2022, Toyota managed to maintain its position as the world's best-selling automaker for the third year in a row.
In January 2023, Toyota CEO and President Akio Toyoda announced that he was stepping down and passing the position on to Koji Sato.
Akio is the great-grandson of company founder Rizaburo Toyoda.
Sato had previously run Lexus, Toyota's luxury car brand.
The change is set to take effect on April 1, 2023.
In 2023, after negotiating with the unions, Toyota implemented the largest increase in employee wages in 20 years.
In 1950, Toyota was split into Toyota Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Sales Co. (sales arm of Toyota); the two companies merged in 1982 to create one unified company, with then-Toyota Motor Co. President Eiji Toyoda becoming chairman.
Chairmen listed prior to 1982 below were for the pre-merger Toyota Motor Co. only.
Similar to the chairman position, in 1982 the then-Toyota Motor Sales Co. President Shoichiro Toyoda becoming President.
President's listed prior to 1982 below were for the pre-merger Toyota Motor Co. only.
Toyota officially lists approximately 70 different models sold under its namesake brand, including sedans, coupes, vans, trucks, hybrids, and crossovers.
Many of these models are produced as passenger sedans, which range from the subcompact Toyota Yaris, compact Corolla, to mid-size Camry and full-size Avalon.
Minivans include the Innova, Alphard/Vellfire, Sienna, and others.
Several small cars, such as the xB and tC, were sold under the Scion brand.
Toyota SUV and crossover line-up grew quickly in the late 2010s to 2020s due to the market shift to SUVs.
Toyota crossovers range from the subcompact Yaris Cross and C-HR, compact Corolla Cross and RAV4, to midsize Harrier/Venza and Kluger/Highlander.
Other crossovers include the Raize, Urban Cruiser.
Toyota SUVs range from the midsize Fortuner to full-size Land Cruiser.
Other SUVs include the Rush, Prado, FJ Cruiser, 4Runner, and Sequoia.
Toyota first entered the pickup truck market in 1947 with the SB that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets.
It was followed in 1954 by the RK (renamed in 1959 as the Stout) and in 1968 by the compact Hilux.
With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable.
Extended cab and crew cab versions were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market in various cab lengths, with gasoline or diesel engines, and 2WD and 4WD versions.
In North America, the Hilux became a major model for the company, leading the company to launch the Tacoma in 1995.
The Tacoma was based on the Hilux, but with a design intended to better suit the needs of North American consumers who often use pickup trucks as personal vehicles.
The design was a success and the Tacoma became the best-selling compact pickup in North America.
After the success of its compact Hilux pickups in North America, Toyota decided to enter the full-size pickup market, which was traditionally dominated by domestic automakers.
The company introduced the T100 for the 1993 US model year.
The T100 had a full-size 8-foot (2.4 m) long bed, but suspension and engine characteristics were similar to that of a compact pickup.
Sales were disappointing and the T100 was criticized for having a small V6 engine (especially compared to the V8 engines common in American full-size trucks), lacking an extended-cab version, being too small, and too expensive (because of the 25% tariff on imported trucks).
In 1995, Toyota added the more powerful V6 engine from the new Tacoma to the T100 and also added an extended cab version.
In 1999, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger Tundra, which would be built in the US with a V8 engine and styling that more closely matched other American full-size trucks.
In the Japanese home market, Toyota has two flagship models: the Crown premium sedan and the Century limousine.
In the 1980s, Toyota wanted to expand its luxury car offerings but realized that existing Japanese-market flagship models had little global appeal and could not compete with established brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar or the Acura and Infiniti marquees being launched by Japanese competitors.
Before the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in markets outside of Japan.
The company developed the brand and its vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.
The Lexus LS flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.
Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV models.
The Lexus brand was introduced to the Japanese market in 2005, previously all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque.
The Toyota Coaster is a minibus introduced in 1969 that seats 17 passengers.
The Coaster is widely used in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia, but also in the developing world for minibus operators in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, the Caribbean, and South America to operate as public transportation.
Toyota is the world's leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, one of the largest companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe, and the first to commercially mass-produce and sell such vehicles, with the introduction of the XW10 Toyota Prius in 1997.
The company's series hybrid technology is called Hybrid Synergy Drive, and it was later applied to many vehicles in Toyota's product lineup, starting first with the Camry and the technology was also brought to the luxury Lexus division.
As of January 2020, Toyota Motor Corporation sells 44 Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models in over 90 countries and regions around the world, and the carmaker has sold over 15 million hybrid vehicles since 1997.
The Prius family is the world's top-selling hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle nameplate with almost 4 million units sold worldwide as of January 2017.
In 2002, Toyota began a development and demonstration program to test the Toyota FCHV, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the Toyota Highlander production SUV.
Toyota also built a FCHV bus based on the Hino Blue Ribbon City low-floor bus.
Toyota has built several prototypes/concepts of the FCHV since 1997, including the Toyota FCHV-1, FCHV-2, FCHV-3, FCHV-4, and Toyota FCHV-adv.
The Toyota FCV-R fuel cell concept car was unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show.
The FCV-R sedan seats four and has a fuel cell stack including a 70 MPa high-pressure hydrogen tank, which can deliver a range of 435 mi (700 km) under the Japanese JC08 test cycle.
Toyota said the car was planned for launch in about 2015.
In August 2012, Toyota announced its plans to start retail sales of a hydrogen fuel-cell sedan in California in 2015.
Toyota expects to become a leader in this technology.
The prototype of its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle will be exhibited at the November 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, and in the United States at the January 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.
Toyota's first hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles to be sold commercially, the Toyota Mirai (Japanese for "future"), was unveiled at the November 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show.
In January 2015, it was announced that production of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle would increase from 700 units in 2015 to approximately 2,000 in 2016 and 3,000 in 2017.
Sales in Japan began on December 15, 2014, at a price of ¥6,700,000 (~US$57,400).
The Japanese government plans to support the commercialization of fuel-cell vehicles with a subsidy of ¥2,000,000 (~US$19,600).
Retail sales in the U.S. began in August 2015 at a price of US$57,500 before any government incentives.
Initially, the Mirai will only be available in California.
The market release in Europe is slated for September 2015, and initially will be available only in the UK, Germany, and Denmark, followed by other countries in 2017.
Pricing in Germany starts at €60,000 (~US$75,140) plus VAT (€78,540).
In 2015, Toyota released 5,600 patents for free use until 2020, hoping to promote global development of hydrogen fuel-cell technology.
Since the mid-2010s, Toyota has increased its focus on building hydrogen powered trucks.
It first showcased a heavy-duty semi-truck tractor in 2017 and in 2023 announced a kit to convert existing diesel-powered truck engines to use hydrogen.
In late 2022, the company signed an £11.3 million government deal with the UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to help it develop a hydrogen-powered Hilux pickup truck.
The Prius Plug-In Hybrid Concept was exhibited in late 2009, and shortly after, a global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began.
The vehicles were leased to fleet and government customers, and were equipped with data tracking devices to allow Toyota to monitor the car's performance.
The vehicle was based on the third-generation Toyota Prius and outfitted with two additional lithium-ion batteries beyond the normal hybrid battery pack.
The additional batteries were used to operate the car with minimal use of the internal combustion engine until they are depleted, at which point they are disengaged from the system.
They are not used in tandem with the main hybrid battery pack.
After the conclusion of the demonstration program, the production version of the Prius Plug-in Hybrid was unveiled in September 2011.
The production Prius Plug-in had a maximum electric-only speed of 100 km/h (62 mph), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the vehicle as having a range of 18 kilometres (11 mi) in blended mode (mostly electric, but supplemented by the internal combustion engine).
Toyota ultimately only did a small production run with 75,400 vehicles being produced between 2012 and 2016.
The second-generation Prius Plug-in (renamed the Prius Prime in the US) was unveiled in early 2016.
Unlike the prior generation, where the plug-in battery was limited by being added to the existing Prius, this model would be developed in tandem with the fourth-generation Prius, allowing Toyota to increase the range to 40 kilometres (25 mi), with a top speed of 135 km/h (84 mph), without needing the assistance of the internal combustion engine.
The second-generation Prius Plug-in went on sale starting in late 2016, with Toyota expecting to sell up to 60,000 units globally per year.
A second plug-in hybrid model, the Toyota RAV4 PHV (RAV4 Prime in the US) was unveiled in December 2019.
The vehicle has an EPA-estimated 68 kilometres (42 mi) of all-electric range and generates a combined 225 kilowatts (302 hp), enabling it to be Toyota's second fastest car currently in production (behind the GR Supra 3.0 sports car).
Sales started in mid-2020.
Toyota has been criticized for being slow to add battery electric vehicles to its lineup.
It has been publicly skeptical of battery-electric vehicles, instead focusing on hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and actively lobbying against government mandates to transition to zero-emissions vehicles.
As of 2023, only a small proportion of the vehicles the company sells are of battery electric, which has prompted criticism by some environmental and public interest groups.
The company plans to increase its sales of electric vehicles to 3.5 million per year by 2030.
However, the company has stated that it believes other technologies, including hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, will continue to play a role in the future of the company.
Toyota created the first generation Toyota RAV4 EV (Electric Vehicle) as a compliance car after the California Air Resources Board mandated in the late 1990s that every automaker offer a zero-emissions vehicle.
A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California from 1997 to 2003, when the state dropped its mandate under legal pressure from lawsuits filed by automakers.
A second generation of the RAV4 EV was developed in 2010 as part of a deal with Tesla.
The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from Tesla.
The RAV4 EV had a limited production run with just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.
According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was "marred by clashes between engineers".
Starting in 2009, Toyota introduced three generations of concept electric vehicles called the FT-EV built on a modified Toyota iQ platform.
In late-2012, the company announced plans build a production version of the car called the Toyota iQ EV (Scion iQ EV in the US, Toyota eQ in Japan), but ultimately production was cut back to 100 cars for special fleet use in Japan and the U.S. only.
A shift in Toyota's formerly battery-agnostic posture could be seen as early as 2016, when Toyota's CFO Takahiko Ijichi “sent a strong signal that Toyota soon plans to jump on the battery bandwagon and make electric cars despite expressing skeptical views about their range and charging times,” as the Wall Street Journal wrote.
Toyota said it would make and sell battery-electric vehicles if and where regulations and markets demand.
A year later, Toyota outlined its electric-vehicle plans for between 2020 and 2030 to the press in Tokyo, saying it would introduce "more than 10" battery-electric vehicles worldwide by the early 2020s, beginning in China, and later in Japan, Europe, the US and India.
In April 2019, Toyota introduced the C-HR EV, its first mass-produced pure electric model in China along with an identical twin called the IZOA EV.
It went on sale in April 2020 and May 2020 respectively.
Nikkei reported in October 2020 that Toyota had only sold less than 2,000 units in the first eight months of the year.
Toyota introduced the C+pod in late 2020, a 2-seater kei car with an estimated range of 100 kilometres (62 mi) and a top speed of 60 kilometres per hour (37 mph).
In December 2020, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda stated that electric cars are excessively "hyped" and that, in Japan, they would not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions since electricity is mostly generated by burning coal and natural gas in the country.
He also said that the infrastructure needed for Japan to switch fully to EVs would cost between $135 billion and $358 billion and switching only to EVs would cost millions of jobs and make cars less affordable.
In April 2021, Toyota revealed the bZ4X, an electric crossover SUV that will be the first vehicle built on a dedicated electric platform called e-TNGA when it goes on sale in mid-2022.
It is the first model of the bZ ("beyond Zero") series of battery electric vehicles.
The company has also stated that there will be seven "bZ" models to be launched globally out of 15 BEV models by 2025.
In December 2021, Toyota announced in Tokyo plans for 30 battery-electric models by 2030, to sell 3.5 million BEVs per year by that date, and that its premium-brand Lexus will be 100% battery-operated by 2030 in North America, Europe, and China.
The company announced investments of $70 billion into the company's electrification.
In a session in parallel with the G-7 Meeting 2023 May, Akio Toyoda said that battery electric vehicles are not solely the future, instead offering a mix of battery electric, internal combustion engine-equipped and hydrogen cars.
Toyota has been developing solid-state batteries in partnership with Panasonic, in which the company has more than a thousand patents covering solid-state batteries by late 2020.
The technology has been implemented on the Toyota LQ concept.
Toyota hopes the technology could increase efficiency of battery electric vehicles by 30 percent, which in turn would reduce battery costs by the same amount.
Toyota is also regarded as lagging when it comes to developing smart car technology.
Although the company unveiled its first self-driving test vehicle in 2017, and has been developing its own self-driving technology named "Chauffeur" (intended for full self-driving) and "Guardian" (a driver assist system), neither of these has been introduced into any production vehicles.
The company had set up a large research and development operation by 2018, spending almost US$4 billion to start an autonomous vehicle research institute in California's Silicon Valley and another ¥300 billion on a similar research institute in Tokyo that would partner with fellow Toyota Group companies and automotive suppliers Aisin Seiki and Denso.
In December 2020, Toyota showcased the 20-passenger "e-Palette" shared autonomous vehicle, which saw its first major use at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
Toyota has announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025.
Since February 2021, Toyota has been building the "Woven City" which it calls a "175-acre high tech, sensor-laden metropolis" at the foot of Mount Fuji.
When completed in 2024, the Woven City will be used to run tests on autonomous vehicles for deliveries, transport and mobile shops, with the city's residents participating in the living laboratory experiment.
Toyota has been involved in many global motorsports series, providing vehicles, engines and other auto parts under both the Toyota and Lexus brands.
Toyota Gazoo Racing (GR) is Toyota's performance brand that is used in many of the world's major motorsports contests.
Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe, based in Cologne, Germany, competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship, while the Finland-based Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT participates in the FIA World Rally Championship.
Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa competes in the Dakar Rally.
Between 2002 and 2009, the Toyota Racing team competed in Formula One.
Toyota won the highest class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans 5 consecutive times from 2018 to 2022, competing with the Toyota TS050 Hybrid and Toyota GR010 Hybrid.
Toyota Racing Development USA (TRD USA) is responsible for participation in major motorsports contests in the United States including NASCAR, NHRA, Indy Racing League and Formula Drift.
Toyota also makes engines and other auto parts for other Japanese motorsports including Super Formula, Super GT, Formula 3, and Toyota Racing Series.
Toyota is a minority shareholder in Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, having invested US$67.2 million in the new venture which will produce the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, slated for first deliveries in 2017.
Toyota has also studied participation in the general aviation market and contracted with Scaled Composites to produce a proof of concept aircraft, the TAA-1, in 2002.
In 1997, building on a previous partnership with Yamaha Marine, Toyota created "Toyota Marine", building private ownership motorboats, currently sold only in Japan.
A small network in Japan sells the luxury craft at 54 locations, called the "Toyota Ponam" series, and in 2017, a boat was labeled under the Lexus brand name starting May 26, 2017.
Toyota works with nonprofits to improve their processes and operations such as the Food Bank For New York City.
In 2004, Toyota showcased its trumpet-playing robot.
Toyota has been developing multitask robots destined for elderly care, manufacturing, and entertainment.
A specific example of Toyota's involvement in robotics for the elderly is the Brain Machine Interface.
Designed for use with wheelchairs, it "allows a person to control an electric wheelchair accurately, almost in real-time", with his or her mind.
The thought controls allow the wheelchair to go left, right, and forward with a delay between thought and movement of just 125 milliseconds.
Toyota also played a part in the development of Kirobo, a 'robotic astronaut'.
In 2017, the company introduced T-HR3, a humanoid robot with the ability to be remotely controlled.
The robot can copy the motions of a connected person.
The 2017 version used wires for the connection but the 2018 version used 5G from a distance up to 10 km (6.2 mi).
Aisin, another member of the Toyota Group of companies, uses the same Toyota wordmark logo to market its home-use sewing machines.
Aisin was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda after he founded the Toyota Motor Corporation.
According to Aisin, he was so pleased with the first sewing machine, he decided to apply the same Toyota branding as his auto business, despite the companies being independent from each other.
Toyota Ventures, along with JetBlue Technology Ventures and Parley for the Oceans, is among the corporate investors that have invested $40 million in the Air Company, a carbon negative vodka distiller and perfume and hand sanitizer manufacturer that uses heterogeneous catalysis to convert captured carbon into ethanol.
Toyota states it is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and it has set a goal to reduce its overall carbon emissions by 90% by 2050, compared to 2010 levels.
The company has invested heavily in solar energy, with a goal to install solar panels on the rooftops of all its dealerships worldwide by 2050.
In addition, Toyota has partnered with various renewable energy companies to promote the use of wind and solar power, including a recent partnership with ENEOS Corporation to develop hydrogen refueling stations in Japan.
Toyota has launched a program called "Global Environmental Challenge" 2050 which is a comprehensive initiative aimed at reducing the environmental impact of Toyota's operations.
The challenge includes six environmental goals that Toyota aims to achieve by 2050, including reducing carbon emissions, minimizing water usage, promoting the recycling and reuse of materials, and promoting the use of renewable energy.
The company has also implemented a variety of initiatives to promote sustainability across its supply chain, including efforts to reduce waste, water usage, and promote sustainable agriculture.
For example, Toyota has implemented a zero-waste initiative at its manufacturing plants, aiming to send zero waste to landfills.
In November 2016, Toyota agreed to pay $3.4 billion to settle allegations that roughly one-and-a-half million of its Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia pickup trucks and SUVs had been outfitted with frames prone to corrosion and perforation.
According to court papers, the corrosion could reach levels high enough to compromise the vehicle's structural integrity.
On February 9, 2002, Kenichi Uchino, aged 30 years, a quality control manager, collapsed then died at work.
On January 2, 2006, an unnamed chief engineer of the Camry Hybrid, aged 45 years, died from heart failure in his bed.
In 2003, Toyota was fined $34 million for violating the United States Clean Air Act, as 2.2 million vehicles it sold had defective smog-control computers.
In January 2021, Toyota was fined $180 million for delays in reporting emissions-related defects to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 2005 and 2015.
The acting U.S. attorney said that the delays "likely led to delayed or avoided emissions-related recalls", although Toyota stated that despite the delays in reporting the issues to the EPA, it had notified customers and fixed the cars with the emissions defects.
At the time, this was the biggest civil penalty ever levied for violating the EPA's emission reporting requirements.
Between 2009 and 2011 Toyota, under pressure from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration.
The first recall, in November 2009, was to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped.
The second recall, in January 2010, was begun after some crashes were shown not to have been caused by floor mats and may be caused by possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.
Worldwide, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were impacted by the recalls.
NHTSA received reports of a total of 37 deaths allegedly related to unintended acceleration, although an exact number was never verified.
As a result of the problems, Toyota faced nearly 100 lawsuits from the families of those killed, drivers who were injured, vehicle owners who lost resale value, and investors who saw a drop in the value of their shares.
While most of the personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits were settled confidentially, Toyota did spend more than US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value, and the company agreed to pay a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects from the public and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image.
The penalty was the largest ever levied against a car company.
Toyota was impacted by a recall of faulty airbag inflators made by Takata.
The inflators can explode, shooting metal fragments into the vehicle cabin.
Millions of vehicles produced between 2000 and 2014 were impacted by the recall, with some needing multiple repairs.
As of January 2024, over 100 million Takata air bag inflators worldwide have been recalled by more than 20 carmakers.
On June 21, 2010, a Chinese labor strike happened in Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Co, Tianjin.
Workers demanded better wages and treatment.
In 2015, U.S. officials asked Toyota how the Islamic State was in possession of so many Toyota trucks.
Toyota cars have also been documented to have been used by other extremist organizations such as the Taliban, Hamas, Al-shabab and Somali pirates.
Toyota representatives have said the company has a strict policy of to not sell vehicles to potential purchasers who may use or modify them for paramilitary or terrorist activities and that it cannot track aftermarket sales and that it has worked with the U.S Treasury to brief them on Toyota's supply chain on the Middle East.
Electric vehicle website IrishEVs criticised Toyota Ireland for paying University College Dublin to conduct a study of only seven examples of their hybrid cars over seven days to make a press release about the efficiency of the vehicles.
The website also criticised Toyota Ireland for using opinion polls to substantiate a claim about their CO2 emissions on Twitter.
In April 2023, it was revealed that Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu had cheated by rigging some models to perform better in crash tests than actual production cars.
The vehicles in question had a notch in the interior panel of the front door which avoided the possibility of the collision creating a sharp edge that could have injured an occupant when the side airbag deployed.
This notch was present on the tested vehicles but not on vehicles sold to the public.
The issue affected four models, the Toyota Yaris Ativ (also known as the Vios), Perodua Axia, Toyota Agya, and an undisclosed upcoming product.
No recall was conducted over the issue.
In December 2023, Daihatsu halted shipments of 64 models, including two dozens branded as Toyota, after safety investigations uncovered misconduct far greater in scope than previously expected.
In some models, the test speeds and results of headrest impact tests were falsified.
In models such as the TownAce and Pixis Joy, the airbag control unit used in testing was different from the part installed on vehicles sold to the public.
Affected markets included Japan as well as Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam.
On 29 January 2024, Koji Sato publicly apologized to customers, dealers and suppliers for the flawed testing.
Toyota is headquartered in the city of Toyota, which was named Koromo until 1951, when it changed its name to match the automaker.
Toyota City is located in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan.
The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a four-story building that has been described as "modest".
In 2013, company CEO Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters due to the lack of amenities in the city.
Surrounding the headquarters are the 14-story Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha plant (which was established in 1938).
Toyota and its Toyota Group affiliates operate a total of 17 manufacturing facilities in Aichi Prefecture and a total of 32 plants in Japan.
Toyota also operates offices in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and Nakamura-ku, Nagoya.
Outside of Japan, as one of the world's largest automotive manufacturer by production volume, Toyota has factories in most parts of the world.
The company assembles vehicles in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.
Additionally, the company also has joint venture, licensed, or contract factories in China, France, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, the United States, and Vietnam.
Toyota Motor North America is headquartered in Plano, Texas, and operates as a holding company for all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
Toyota's operations in North America began on October 31, 1957, and the current company was established in 2017 from the consolidation of three companies: Toyota Motor North America, Inc., which controlled Toyota's corporate functions; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. which handled marketing, sales, and distribution in the United States; and Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America which oversaw operations at all assembly plants in the region.
While all three companies continue to exist in legal name, they operate as one company out of one headquarters campus.
Toyota has a large presence in the United States with six major assembly plants in Huntsville, Alabama, Georgetown, Kentucky, Princeton, Indiana, San Antonio, Texas, Buffalo, West Virginia, and Blue Springs, Mississippi.
In 2018, Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture plant that will produce vehicles in Huntsville, Alabama, starting in 2021.
It has started producing larger trucks, such as the new Tundra, to go after the full-size pickup market in the United States.
Toyota is also pushing hybrid electric vehicle in the US such as the Prius, Camry Hybrid, Highlander Hybrid, and various Lexus products.
Toyota never introduced diesel motor options in its North American products, including pickup trucks.
Toyota Canada Inc., which is part of Toyota Motor North America, handles marketing, sales, and distribution in Canada.
Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada operates three assembly plants: two in Cambridge, Ontario and one in Woodstock, Ontario.
In 2006, Toyota's subsidiary Hino Motors opened a heavy duty truck plant, also in Woodstock, employing 45 people and producing 2,000 trucks annually.
Toyota Motor Europe is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, and oversees all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Europe and western Asia.
Toyota's operations in Europe began in 1963.
Toyota has a significant presence in Europe with nine production facilities in Kolín, Czech Republic, Burnaston, England, Deeside, England, Onnaing, France, Jelcz-Laskowice, Poland, Wałbrzych, Poland, Ovar, Portugal, Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Arifiye, Turkey.
Toyota also operates a joint venture plant with Citroën and Peugeot in Valenciennes, France.
In 1963, Australia was one of the first countries to assemble Toyotas outside Japan.
However, in February 2014, Toyota was the last of Australia's major automakers to announce the end of production in Australia.
The closure of Toyota's Australian plant was completed on October 3, 2017, and had produced a total 3,451,155 vehicles.
At its peak in October 2007, Toyota manufactured 15,000 cars a month.
Before Toyota, Ford and GM's Holden had announced similar moves, all citing an unfavorable currency and attendant high manufacturing costs.
The Toyota Way is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the company's approach to management and production (which is further defined as the Toyota Production System).
The company has been developing its corporate philosophy since 1948 and passing it on as implicit knowledge to new employees, but as the company expanded globally, leaders officially identified and defined the Toyota Way in 2001.
Toyota summarized it under two main pillars: continuous improvement and respect for people.
Under the continuous improvement pillar are three principles: challenge (form a long-term vision), kaizen (a continual improvement process), and genchi genbutsu ("go and see" the process to make correct decisions).
Under the respect for people pillar are two principles: respect and teamwork.
In 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a University of Michigan professor of industrial engineering, published The Toyota Way.
In his book, Liker calls the Toyota Way "a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work."
According to Liker, there are 14 principles of The Toyota Way that can be organized into four themes: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning.
The 14 principles are further defined in the Wikipedia article on The Toyota Way.
The Toyota Way also helped shape the company's approach to production, where it was an early pioneer of what would become known as lean manufacturing.
The company defines the Toyota Production System under two main pillars: just-in-time (make only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed) and Jidoka (automation with a human touch).
The origin of the Toyota Production System is in dispute, with three stories of its origin: (1) that during a 1950 trip to train with the Ford Motor Company, company executives also studied the just-in-time distribution system of the grocery store company Piggly-Wiggly, (2) that they followed the writings of W. Edwards Deming, and (3) they learned the principles from a WWII US government training program (Training Within Industry).
After developing the Toyota Production System in its own facilities, the company began teaching the system to its parts suppliers in the 1990s.
Other companies were interested in the instruction, and Toyota later started offering training sessions.
The company also has donated the training to non-profit groups to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people.
In 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line.
After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to "Toyota" from the family name "Toyoda", which means rice paddy.
The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune.
The original logo was a heavily stylized version of the katakana characters for Toyota (トヨタ).
Toyota introduced a worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand.
The logo consists of three ovals that combine to form the letter "T", which stands for Toyota.
Toyota says that the overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the "global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future".
The new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most vehicles in 1990.
In countries or regions using traditional Chinese characters, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as "豐田".
In countries using simplified Chinese characters (e.g. China and Singapore), Toyota is written as "丰田" (pronounced as Fēngtián in Mandarin Chinese and Hɔng Tshan in Minnanese).
These are the same characters as the founding family's name "Toyoda" in Japanese.
Toyota still uses the katakana character logo as its corporate emblem in Japan, including on the headquarters building, and some special edition models still use the "TOYOTA" wordmark on the grille as a nod to the company's heritage.
On July 15, 2015, the company was delegated its own generic top-level domain, .toyota.
As of 2017, Toyota is an official sponsor of Cricket Australia, the England and Wales Cricket Board and the AFL.
In March 2015, Toyota became a sponsor partner for the Olympic Games, in the form of supplying vehicles and communications between vehicles.
In May 2024, Toyota announced that it will not be extending the contract after the 2024 games in Paris, but hopes to retain its contract as a top sponsor with the International Paralympic Committee.
Toyota had previously sponsored football clubs Valencia (2003–2008), Fiorentina (1999–2002 and 2004–2010), Perugia (2002–2004), Catania (2003–2004) and Valenciennes (2005–2012).
The trunk (North American English) or boot (British English) of a car is the vehicle's main storage or cargo compartment, often a hatch at the rear of the vehicle.
It can also be called a tailgate.
In Indian English the storage area is known as a dickey (also spelled dicky, dickie, or diggy), and in Southeast Asia as a compartment.
The trunk or luggage compartment is most often at the rear of the vehicle.
Early designs had an exterior rack on the rear of the vehicle to attach a luggage trunk.
Later designs integrated the storage area into the vehicle's body, and eventually became more streamlined.
The main storage compartment is normally provided at the end of the vehicle opposite to which the engine is located.
Some vehicles have the trunk in front of the passenger compartment, e.g. rear-engined cars like Volkswagen Beetle and Porsche 911, or electric vehicles like Ford F-150 Lightning.
This is known as a frunk, a portmanteau of the words "front" and "trunk".
The alternative term froot (a combination of "front" and "boot") is also occasionally used.
There are also vehicles with both front and rear trunks, either with low profile rear drivetrains, e.g. Volkswagen Type 3 or Tesla Model S, or with a mid-engine, e.g. Porsche 914 and Boxster, Toyota MR2 and Fiat X1/9.
Sometimes during the design life of the vehicle, the lid may be restyled to increase the size or improve the practicality and usefulness of the trunk's shape.
Examples of this include the Beetle redesign to the 1970s 'Super Beetle' and the pre-war and 1950s post war Citroën Traction Avant.
The door or opening of a cargo area may be hinged at the top, side, or bottom.
If the door is hinged at the bottom it is called a tailgate, particularly in the United States.
They are used on station wagons and pickup trucks, as well as on some sport utility vehicles (SUV).
Traditional drop-down station wagon and pickup tailgates can also serve as a mount for a workbench.
Traditional U.S. station wagons included a roll-down window retracting into the tailgate to load small items or to allow the tailgate to be opened down on its bottom-mounted hinges.
Because of the potential for carbon-monoxide fumes, the tailgate window on station wagons should be closed whenever the engine is running.
Two-way station wagon tailgates may be hinged at the side and the bottom so they can be opened sideways like a regular door, or drop downwards as load platform extenders.
They are designed with special handle(s) for opening in the selected direction on special hinges after the window is lowered.
A three-way design that was also used by Ford allows for the tailgate to be opened like a door with the window up.
General Motors developed a clam shell style "disappearing" design where the rear window rolls up into the roof and the tailgate slides down and beneath the load floor.
If the door is hinged at the top it is termed a hatch, and a car with a rear hatch a hatchback.
A bottom-opening door is now common on SUVs.
The trunk lid (in the U.S. automotive industry sometimes also called decklid or deck lid) is the cover that allows access to the main storage or luggage compartment.
Hinges allow the lid to be raised.
Devices such as a manually positioned prop rod can keep the panel up in the open position.
Counterbalancing torsion or other spring(s) can also be used to help elevate and hold open the trunk lid.
On cars with their trunk in the rear, lids sometimes incorporate a center-mounted third brake light.
A rear lid may also have a decorative air spoiler.
On many modern cars, the trunk lids can be unlocked with the car's key fob.
In 1950, Ford introduced a trigger catch to allow for one-handed lifting until the trunk lid was automatically caught in the open position.
In 1952, Buick marketed its counterbalanced trunk lid that "practically raises itself" and the automatic locking mechanism.
In 1956, the Packard "Predictor" show car designed by Dick Teague debuted at the Chicago Auto Show featuring innovations such as a power operated trunk lid.
In 1958, the remote activated electric trunk release was introduced by U.S. automakers in production vehicles.
The 1965 AMC Cavalier concept car featured a trunk lid with dual-action, scissor-type hinges allowing the panel to be opened like a normal trunk lid, or to be horizontally elevated even to the height of the car's roof line for greater utility when hauling large and bulky items.
Both the hood and trunk lid were made from identical stampings and interchangeable.
The locking of the trunk may be achieved together with the passenger compartment.
release of the latch whereby the door seals push the decklid away from the lock, the trunk is then open, and the lid may not have revealed the opening.
release of the latch whereby a spring pushes the decklid away from the lock and open, the trunk is then open, and the lid reveals the opening.
release of the latch and actuation of a drive, whether hydraulic (BMW 7 Series) or electric (BMW X6), which pushes the decklid away from the lock; the trunk is then open, and the lid reveals the opening.
This may then be electrically closed again.
The usage of the word "trunk" comes from it being the word for a large travelling chest, as such trunks were often attached to the back of the vehicle before the development of integrated storage compartments in the 1930s; while the usage of the word "boot" comes from the word for a built-in compartment on a horse-drawn coach (originally used as a seat for the coachman and later for storage).
The usage of the word "dickie" comes from the British word for a rumble seat, as such seats were often used for luggage before cars had integrated storage.
In France, from 1900 onwards, the luggage maker Moynat became a market leader in automobile luggage, for which the company developed a number of patented products including the rear-attached limousine trunk with custom-fitted suitcases.
In 1928 came the side or lateral sliding trunk, a mechanism that foreshadowed the development of integrated trunks in vehicles from the 1930s onwards.
Open compartments are those found in station wagons and SUVs, while closed compartments have a trunk lid and are typically found in saloon (sedan) or coupé bodies.
Closed compartments are separated from the passenger compartment by rigid body elements or seats, and are generally trimmed in simple materials, whereas many station wagons are trimmed with better-looking materials as the space is an extension of the passenger compartment.
In order to hide the compartment content of station wagons or hatchbacks from thieves or sunlight, a cover may be fitted.
On hatchbacks this often has the form of a rigid parcel shelf or a flexible sheet with hooks on the corners, while station wagons and many SUVs have a roller blind in a removable cassette.
To give the space more flexibility, many cars have foldable rear seats, which can increase the size of the trunk when needed.
The trunk space can contribute to the active and passive safety of the vehicle.
Active safety may be promoted in vehicles that are partially loaded.
Here the use of lashing eyes to restrain luggage can prevent or reduce damage to the vehicle and its occupants in severe maneuvers.
In driving while cornering 'in-extremis', the prevention of sudden weight transfer due to poorly loaded luggage can be enough to prevent the vehicle from losing grip, and potentially avoiding thereby an accident; active safety.
If a crash should occur, lashing eyes can reduce the severity of the outcome of the accident by keeping the luggage in the loadspace compartment and thereby preventing projectiles from harming correctly restrained passengers in the passenger compartment.
These lashing features may be in the form of fixed or foldable loops, or in the case of certain European vehicles combine sliding loops in a rail system to allow optimal positioning of the lashing eyes.
At the same time, this eases the integration of accessories for loadspace management; dividers, bike carriers, etc. into the interior of the vehicle, a principle that has been applied in cargo vans and air transport for many years.
In vehicles with open luggage compartments, some are fitted with metal grids or guards to retain loose items in case of collision, or to simply create a bulkhead between the load in the trunk – for example, animals – separated from the otherwise unprotected passenger space.
Another solution for items that have not been restrained is the loadspace barrier net.
These may be directly attached to the body structure or, in vehicles with loadspace cover cassettes, as a combined loadspace cover and barrier net.
The net confines luggage to the loadspace in case of emergency braking and minor traffic collisions.
These nets have the advantage over metal guards in that they can be rolled-up when not in use, taking up much less space than a comparable guard.
A guard may however be tailored for an even tighter fit to the body interior contours than a roll-away net.
Children – and sometimes adults who climb inside to work on the vehicle – who become trapped in trunks can die of suffocation or heat stroke.
Once in the trunk, they may not be able to get out, even if they entered through the interior, because many rear seats release to the trunk only from inside the passenger area.
Beginning with the 2002 models, a glow-in-the-dark inside trunk release is required on all vehicles with conventional trunks sold in the United States.
Hatchbacks, wagons, vans, and SUVs are exempt from this requirement because it is assumed a trapped person can kick out any cargo cover or parcel shelf to gain access to the main interior and passenger doors.
Riding in the trunk is dangerous and illegal.
Teenagers in the U.S. may attempt to avoid laws which prohibit new car drivers from driving with passengers by riding in the trunk.
Electronics for sound, video, satellite navigation, etc. Battery and hybrid energy store (see plug-in hybrids).
Some vehicles offer configurable cargo conveniences such as a shelf or board.
They often serve various purposes.
In addition to its 65/35 split fold-down and removable rear seat, the multiposition rear shelf on the Chrysler PT Cruiser can be used as a table for a picnic, a second cargo layer, or a security screen.
The Citroën C3 has a foldable segmented false floorboard that compartmentalizes the cargo area, makes loading easier, and evens out the load floor when the back of the rear seat is folded down.
The trunk (North American English) or boot (British English) of a car is the vehicle's main storage or cargo compartment, often a hatch at the rear of the vehicle.
It can also be called a tailgate.
In Indian English the storage area is known as a dickey (also spelled dicky, dickie, or diggy), and in Southeast Asia as a compartment.
The trunk or luggage compartment is most often at the rear of the vehicle.
Early designs had an exterior rack on the rear of the vehicle to attach a luggage trunk.
Later designs integrated the storage area into the vehicle's body, and eventually became more streamlined.
The main storage compartment is normally provided at the end of the vehicle opposite to which the engine is located.
Some vehicles have the trunk in front of the passenger compartment, e.g. rear-engined cars like Volkswagen Beetle and Porsche 911, or electric vehicles like Ford F-150 Lightning.
This is known as a frunk, a portmanteau of the words "front" and "trunk".
The alternative term froot (a combination of "front" and "boot") is also occasionally used.
There are also vehicles with both front and rear trunks, either with low profile rear drivetrains, e.g. Volkswagen Type 3 or Tesla Model S, or with a mid-engine, e.g. Porsche 914 and Boxster, Toyota MR2 and Fiat X1/9.
Sometimes during the design life of the vehicle, the lid may be restyled to increase the size or improve the practicality and usefulness of the trunk's shape.
Examples of this include the Beetle redesign to the 1970s 'Super Beetle' and the pre-war and 1950s post war Citroën Traction Avant.
The door or opening of a cargo area may be hinged at the top, side, or bottom.
If the door is hinged at the bottom it is called a tailgate, particularly in the United States.
They are used on station wagons and pickup trucks, as well as on some sport utility vehicles (SUV).
Traditional drop-down station wagon and pickup tailgates can also serve as a mount for a workbench.

Transport (in British English) or transportation (in American English) is the intentional movement of humans, animals, and goods from one location to another.
Modes of transport include air, land (rail and road), water, cable, pipelines, and space.
The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles, and operations.
Transport enables human trade, which is essential for the development of civilizations.
Transport infrastructure consists of both fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals, and pipelines, and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fuel docks and fuel stations), and seaports.
Terminals may be used both for the interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.
Means of transport are any of the different kinds of transport facilities used to carry people or cargo.
They may include vehicles, riding animals, and pack animals.
Vehicles may include wagons, automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft, and aircraft.
A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a certain type of vehicle, infrastructure, and operation.
The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called inter-modal or multi-modal transport.
Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen on the basis of cost, capability, and route.
Governments deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies.
In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.
Passenger transport may be public, where operators provide scheduled services, or private.
Freight transport has become focused on containerization, although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items.
Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land.
While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl.
Human-powered transport, a form of sustainable transport, is the transport of people or goods using human muscle-power, in the form of walking, running, and swimming.
Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power.
Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, leisure, physical exercise, and environmentalism; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.
Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and inline skates.
Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by watercraft rowing and skiing; even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft.
Animal-powered transport is the use of working animals for the movement of people and commodities.
Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as pack animals for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in teams, to pull sleds or wheeled vehicles.
A fixed-wing aircraft, commonly called an airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift.
The term is used to distinguish this from rotary-wing aircraft, where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift.
A gyroplane is both fixed-wing and rotary wing.
Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large airliners and military cargo aircraft.
Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an area for landing.
The majority of aircraft also need an airport with the infrastructure for maintenance, restocking, and refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers.
While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water.
Land transport covers all land-based transport systems that provide for the movement of people, goods, and services.
Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other.
Land transport is a key factor in urban planning.
It consists of two kinds, rail and road.
Rail transport is where a train runs along a set of two parallel steel rails, known as a railway or railroad.
The rails are anchored perpendicular to ties (or sleepers) of timber, concrete, or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or gauge.
The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed earth and gravel in a bed of ballast.
Alternative methods include monorail and maglev.
A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails.
Propulsion is commonly provided by a locomotive, that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight.
The locomotive can be powered by steam, by diesel, or by electricity supplied by trackside systems.
Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a multiple unit.
Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics, and gas turbines.
Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more energy efficient, though not as efficient as ships.
Intercity trains are long-haul services connecting cities; modern high-speed rail is capable of speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph), but this requires specially built track.
Regional and commuter trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity tramways and rapid transits, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport.
Freight trains traditionally used box cars, requiring manual loading and unloading of the cargo.
Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.
A road is an identifiable route, way, or path between two or more places.
Roads are typically smoothed, paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel; though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance.
In urban areas, roads may pass through a city or village and be named as streets, serving a dual function as urban space easement and route.
The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor.
Other users of roads include buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and pedestrians.
As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide.
Road transport offers complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience.
This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport.
It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport.
Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful noise and air pollution in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.
Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.
Water transport is movement by means of a watercraft—such as a barge, boat, ship, or sailboat—over a body of water, such as a sea, ocean, lake, canal, or river.
The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the hull a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance, and appearance.
Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods.
Commercial vessels, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4 billion tons of cargo in 2007.
Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental shipping; short sea shipping and ferries remain viable in coastal areas.
Pipeline transport sends goods through a pipe; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but pneumatic tubes can also send solid capsules using compressed air.
For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline.
Short-distance systems exist for sewage, slurry, water, and beer, while long-distance networks are used for petroleum and natural gas.
Cable transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source.
It is most commonly used at steep gradient.
Typical solutions include aerial tramways, elevators, and ski lifts; some of these are also categorized as conveyor transport.
Spaceflight is transport outside Earth's atmosphere by means of a spacecraft.
It is most frequently used for satellites placed in Earth orbit.
However, human spaceflight mission have landed on the Moon and are occasionally used to rotate crew-members to space stations.
Uncrewed spacecraft have also been sent to all the planets of the Solar System.
Suborbital spaceflight is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant "other place" on Earth.
Faster transport could be achieved through part of a low Earth orbit or by following that trajectory even faster, using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it.
Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate.
It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance.
For rail, pipeline, road, and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed.
Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the airway and seaway do not need to be constructed.
However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.
Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another.
For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits.
For instance, airport rail links connect airports to the city centres and suburbs.
The terminals for automobiles are parking lots, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.
For freight, terminals act as transshipment points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use.
The financing of infrastructure can either be public or private.
Transport is often a natural monopoly and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports, are funded through taxation.
New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through debt.
Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as landing fees at airports or toll plazas on roads.
Independent of this, authorities may impose taxes on the purchase or use of vehicles.
Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.
Animals used in transportation include pack animals and riding animals.
A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods.
Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders.
Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a steam engine, combustion engine, electric motor, jet engine, or rocket, though other means of propulsion also exist.
Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through wheels, propellers, and pressure.
Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a driver.
However, some systems, such as people movers and some rapid transits, are fully automated.
For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers.
Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles, or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.
Recently, the progress related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought a lot of new emerging technologies for transportation and automotive fields such as Connected Vehicles and Autonomous Driving.
These innovations are said to form future mobility, but concerns remain on safety and cybersecurity, particularly concerning connected and autonomous mobility.
Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves.
For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through private enterprise or by governments.
The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities.
Traditionally, many countries have had a national airline and national railway.
Since the 1980s, many of these have been privatized.
International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation, but ports can be public-owned.
As the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and population—according to the United Nations, 55% of the world's population live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%.
Public transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world.
The institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible.
This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.
Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport.
However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical relocation of armed forces during warfare, or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment.
Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into public and private transport.
Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire.
The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity and a higher environmental impact.
Travel may be as part of daily commuting or for business, leisure, or migration.
Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit.
The latter consists of buses in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams, and rapid transit in larger cities.
Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, coaches, and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel.
Intermodal passenger transport is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal.
Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a transport hub, such as a bus or railway station.
Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum.
Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive.
In the middle is demand-responsive transport, offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.
International travel may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and visa requirements.
An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment, and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical care to the patient.
The word is often associated with road-going "emergency ambulances", which form part of emergency medical services, administering emergency care to those with acute medical problems.
Air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes.
Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft.
Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the value chain in manufacturing.
With increased specialization and globalization, production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport.
Transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption.
While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.
Logistics refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information.
Incoterm deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of risk during transport.
Containerization, with the standardization of ISO containers on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized international and domestic trade, offering a huge reduction in transshipment costs.
Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in economy of scale in vehicle operation.
This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s.
Bulk transport is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are ore, coal, cereals, and petroleum.
Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently.
The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk.
Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.
Air freight has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value.
Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as postponement and just-in-time within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio.
In addition to mail, common items sent by air include electronics and fashion clothing.
Transport is a key necessity for specialization—allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations.
Throughout history, transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more trade and a greater spread of people.
Economic growth has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.
But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making transport sustainability a major issue.
Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities.
Passenger transport is also the essence of tourism, a major part of recreational transport.
Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed.
In lean thinking, transporting materials or work in process from one location to another is seen as one of the seven wastes (Japanese term: muda) which do not add value to a product.
Transport planning allows for high use and less impact regarding new infrastructure.
Using models of transport forecasting, planners are able to predict future transport patterns.
On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the supply chain.
Transport as a field is also studied through transport economics, a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities.
Transport engineering, a sub-discipline of civil engineering, must take into account trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and route assignment, while the operative level is handled through traffic engineering.
Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity.
Automotive transport can be seen as a tragedy of the commons, where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all.
Density of development depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial use.
Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport.
There are economies of agglomeration.
Beyond transport, some land uses are more efficient when clustered.
Transport facilities consume land, and in cities pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use.
An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.
Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput mean that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it.
It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places; as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociology, and economics—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned.
Transport is a major use of energy and burns most of the world's petroleum.
This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.
By sub-sector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.
Environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle.
Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.
Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased transport electrification and energy efficiency.
Other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion and automobile-oriented urban sprawl, which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands.
By reducing transport emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's air quality, acid rain, smog, and climate change.
While electric cars are being built to cut down CO2 emission at the point of use, an approach that is becoming popular among cities worldwide is to prioritize public transport, bicycles, and pedestrian movement.
Redirecting vehicle movement to create 20-minute neighbourhoods that promotes exercise while greatly reducing vehicle dependency and pollution.
Some policies are levying a congestion charge to cars for travelling within congested areas during peak time.
Airplane emissions change depending on the flight distance.
It takes a lot of energy to take off and land, so longer flights are more efficient per mile traveled.
However, longer flights naturally use more fuel in total.
Short flights produce the most CO2 per passenger mile, while long flights produce slightly less.
Things get worse when planes fly high in the atmosphere.
Their emissions trap much more heat than those released at ground level.
This isn't just because of CO2, but a mix of other greenhouse gases in the exhaust.
City buses produce about 0.3 kg of CO2 for every mile traveled per passenger.
For long-distance bus trips (over 20 miles), that pollution drops to about 0.08 kg of CO2 per passenger mile.
On average, commuter trains produce around 0.17 kg of CO2 for each mile traveled per passenger.
Long-distance trains are slightly higher at about 0.19 kg of CO2 per passenger mile.
The fleet emission average for delivery vans, trucks and big rigs is 10.17 kg (22.4 lb) CO2 per gallon of diesel consumed.
Delivery vans and trucks average about 7.8 mpg (or 1.3 kg of CO2 per mile) while big rigs average about 5.3 mpg (or 1.92 kg of CO2 per mile).
The United Nations first formally recognized the role of transport in sustainable development in the 1992 United Nations Earth summit.
In the 2012 United Nations World Conference, global leaders unanimously recognized that transport and mobility are central to achieving the sustainability targets.
In recent years, data has been collected to show that the transport sector contributes to a quarter of the global greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore sustainable transport has been mainstreamed across several of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, especially those related to food, security, health, energy, economic growth, infrastructure, and cities and human settlements.
Meeting sustainable transport targets is said to be particularly important to achieving the Paris Agreement.
There are various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are promoting sustainable transport to meet the defined goals.
These include SDG 3 on health (increased road safety), SDG 7 on energy, SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 on resilient infrastructure, SDG 11 on sustainable cities (access to transport and expanded public transport), SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production (ending fossil fuel subsidies), and SDG 14 on oceans, seas, and marine resources.
Humans' first ways to move included walking, running, and swimming.
The domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration.
Inventions such as the wheel and the sled (U.K. sledge) helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of vehicles.
The first forms of road transport involved animals, such as horses (domesticated in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), oxen (from about 8000 BCE), or humans carrying goods over dirt tracks that often followed game trails.
Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to time immemorial and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the Industrial Revolution.
The first watercraft were canoes cut out from tree trunks.
Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two.
The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water.
Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.
The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century saw several inventions fundamentally change transport.
With telegraphy, communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects.
The invention of the steam engine, closely followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles.
Both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources.
The 19th century also saw the development of the steam ship, which sped up global transport.
With the development of the combustion engine and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated.
The first "modern" highways were constructed during the 19th century with macadam.
Later, tarmac and concrete became the dominant paving materials.
In 1903 the Wright brothers demonstrated the first successful controllable airplane, and after World War I (1914–1918) aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.
After World War II (1939–1945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services.
Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled.
In the 1950s the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering globalization.
International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s with the commercialization of the jet engine.
Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance.
After the introduction of the Shinkansen in Japan in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes away from the airlines.
Early in U.S. history, private joint-stock corporations owned most aqueducts, bridges, canals, railroads, roads, and tunnels.
Most such transport infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the nationalization of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of Amtrak.
Recently, however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some ground and adherents.
A drive wheel is a wheel of a motor vehicle that transmits force, transforming torque into tractive force from the tires to the road, causing the vehicle to move.
The powertrain delivers enough torque to the wheel to overcome stationary forces, resulting in the vehicle moving forwards or backwards.
A two-wheel drive vehicle has two driven wheels, typically both at the front or back, while a four-wheel drive has four.
A steering wheel is a wheel that turns to change the direction of a vehicle.
A trailer wheel is one that is neither a drive wheel, nor a steer wheel.
Front-wheel drive vehicles typically have the rear wheels as trailer wheels.
Front-wheel drive (FWD) vehicles' engines drive the front wheels.
Using the front wheels for delivery of power as well as steering allows the driving force to act in the same direction as the wheel is pointing.
This layout is commonly used in modern passenger cars.
A rare example of front wheel drive was the Opperman Motocart.
This slow-speed agricultural and light freight vehicle was a tricycle with the front wheel carrying a large tractor tyre.
The wheel was powered by a small single cylinder Douglas engine carried on the front mono fork that formed the steering gear.
See also Front-engine, front-wheel drive layout.
Rear-wheel drive (RWD) typically places the engine in the front of the vehicle, with a driveshaft running the length of the vehicle to the differential transmission.
However, mid engine and rear engine layouts can also be used.
It was a common layout used in automobiles throughout the 20th century.
At this time, FWD designs were not practical due to complexity (in FWD, engine power and steering must both be combined in the front axle).
For four-wheeled vehicles, two-wheel drive describes vehicles that transmit torque to at most two road wheels, referred to as either front- or rear-wheel drive.
The term 4x2 is also used, to indicate four total road-wheels with two being driven.
For vehicles that have partial four-wheel drive, the term two-wheel drive refers to the mode when four-wheel drive is deactivated and torque is applied to only two wheels.
This configuration allows all four road wheels to receive torque from the power plant simultaneously.
It is often used in rally racing on mostly paved roads.
Four-wheel drive is common in off-road vehicles because powering all four wheels provides better control on loose and slippery surfaces.
Four-wheel drive manufacturers have different systems such as "High Range 4WD" and "Low Range 4WD".
These systems may provide added features such as a varying of torque distribution between axles or varying gear ratios.
Common terms for this configuration include four-wheel drive, 4WD, 4x4 (pronounced "four-by-four"), integral, and all-wheel drive (AWD).
Ten-wheel drive (10WD, 10×10) is a drivetrain configuration of ten wheels, all of which are driven simultaneously by the engine.
Unlike four-wheel drive drivetrains, this configuration is only used in extreme off-road and military uses, in particular heavy haulage and missile carriers.
Some severe/extreme duty semi tractors may also have this drive configuration.
The Oshkosh M1074 and M1075 prime mover units in the U.S. Army's Palletized Load System (PLS), the U.S. Marine's 10x10 Oshkosh Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), and the Tatra T816 10×10 cargo carrier are examples of ten-wheel drive vehicles.
10x10's are not as common as 4×4's, 6×6's and 8×8's.
Twelve-wheel drive (12WD, 12×12), refers to a twelve-wheeled vehicle with a drivetrain that allows all twelve wheels to receive power from the engine simultaneously.
This configuration is typically used in heavy-duty and extreme off-road and military purposes.
In an internal combustion engine, a turbocharger (also known as a turbo or a turbosupercharger) is a forced induction device that is powered by the flow of exhaust gases.
It uses this energy to compress the intake air, forcing more air into the engine in order to produce more power for a given displacement.
The current categorisation is that a turbocharger is powered by the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, whereas a supercharger is mechanically powered (usually by a belt from the engine's crankshaft).
However, up until the mid-20th century, a turbocharger was called a "turbosupercharger" and was considered a type of supercharger.
Prior to the invention of the turbocharger, forced induction was only possible using mechanically-powered superchargers.
Use of superchargers began in 1878, when several supercharged two-stroke gas engines were built using a design by Scottish engineer Dugald Clerk.
Then in 1885, Gottlieb Daimler patented the technique of using a gear-driven pump to force air into an internal combustion engine.
The 1905 patent by Alfred Büchi, a Swiss engineer working at Sulzer is often considered the birth of the turbocharger.
This patent was for a compound radial engine with an exhaust-driven axial flow turbine and compressor mounted on a common shaft.
The first prototype was finished in 1915 with the aim of overcoming the power loss experienced by aircraft engines due to the decreased density of air at high altitudes.
However, the prototype was not reliable and did not reach production.
Another early patent for turbochargers was applied for in 1916 by French steam turbine inventor Auguste Rateau, for their intended use on the Renault engines used by French fighter planes.
Separately, testing in 1917 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and Sanford Alexander Moss showed that a turbocharger could enable an engine to avoid any power loss (compared with the power produced at sea level) at an altitude of up to 4,250 m (13,944 ft) above sea level.
The testing was conducted at Pikes Peak in the United States using the Liberty L-12 aircraft engine.
The first commercial application of a turbocharger was in June 1924 when the first heavy duty turbocharger, model VT402, was delivered from the Baden works of Brown, Boveri & Cie, under the supervision of Alfred Büchi, to SLM, Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works in Winterthur.
This was followed very closely in 1925, when Alfred Büchi successfully installed turbochargers on ten-cylinder diesel engines, increasing the power output from 1,300 to 1,860 kilowatts (1,750 to 2,500 hp).
This engine was used by the German Ministry of Transport for two large passenger ships called the Preussen and Hansestadt Danzig.
The design was licensed to several manufacturers and turbochargers began to be used in marine, railcar and large stationary applications.
Turbochargers were used on several aircraft engines during World War II, beginning with the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in 1938, which used turbochargers produced by General Electric.
Other early turbocharged airplanes included the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and experimental variants of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190.
Automobile manufacturers began research into turbocharged engines during the 1950s, however the problems of "turbo lag" and the bulky size of the turbocharger were not able to be solved at the time.
The first turbocharged cars were the short-lived Chevrolet Corvair Monza and the Oldsmobile Jetfire, both introduced in 1962.
Greater adoption of turbocharging in passenger cars began in the 1980s, as a way to increase the performance of smaller displacement engines.
Like other forced induction devices, a compressor in the turbocharger pressurises the intake air before it enters the inlet manifold.
In the case of a turbocharger, the compressor is powered by the kinetic energy of the engine's exhaust gases, which is extracted by the turbocharger's turbine.
The turbine uses a series of blades to convert kinetic energy from the flow of exhaust gases to mechanical energy of a rotating shaft (which is used to power the compressor section).
The turbine housings direct the gas flow through the turbine section, and the turbine itself can spin at speeds of up to 250,000 rpm.
Some turbocharger designs are available with multiple turbine housing options, allowing a housing to be selected to best suit the engine's characteristics and the performance requirements.
A turbocharger's performance is closely tied to its size, and the relative sizes of the turbine wheel and the compressor wheel.
Large turbines typically require higher exhaust gas flow rates, therefore increasing turbo lag and increasing the boost threshold.
Small turbines can produce boost quickly and at lower flow rates, since it has lower rotational inertia, but can be a limiting factor in the peak power produced by the engine.
Various technologies, as described in the following sections, are often aimed at combining the benefits of both small turbines and large turbines.
Large diesel engines often use a single-stage axial inflow turbine instead of a radial turbine.
A twin-scroll turbocharger uses two separate exhaust gas inlets, to make use of the pulses in the flow of the exhaust gasses from each cylinder.
In a standard (single-scroll) turbocharger, the exhaust gas from all cylinders is combined and enters the turbocharger via a single intake, which causes the gas pulses from each cylinder to interfere with each other.
For a twin-scroll turbocharger, the cylinders are split into two groups in order to maximize the pulses.
The exhaust manifold keeps the gases from these two groups of cylinders separated, then they travel through two separate spiral chambers ("scrolls") before entering the turbine housing via two separate nozzles.
The scavenging effect of these gas pulses recovers more energy from the exhaust gases, minimizes parasitic back losses and improves responsiveness at low engine speeds.
Another common feature of twin-scroll turbochargers is that the two nozzles are different sizes: the smaller nozzle is installed at a steeper angle and is used for low-rpm response, while the larger nozzle is less angled and optimised for times when high outputs are required.
Variable-geometry turbochargers (also known as variable-nozzle turbochargers) are used to alter the effective aspect ratio of the turbocharger as operating conditions change.
This is done with the use of adjustable vanes located inside the turbine housing between the inlet and turbine, which affect flow of gases towards the turbine.
Some variable-geometry turbochargers use a rotary electric actuator to open and close the vanes, while others use a pneumatic actuator.
If the turbine's aspect ratio is too large, the turbo will fail to create boost at low speeds; if the aspect ratio is too small, the turbo will choke the engine at high speeds, leading to high exhaust manifold pressures, high pumping losses, and ultimately lower power output.
By altering the geometry of the turbine housing as the engine accelerates, the turbo's aspect ratio can be maintained at its optimum.
Because of this, variable-geometry turbochargers often have reduced lag, a lower boost threshold, and greater efficiency at higher engine speeds.
The benefit of variable-geometry turbochargers is that the optimum aspect ratio at low engine speeds is very different from that at high engine speeds.
An electrically-assisted turbocharger combines a traditional exhaust-powered turbine with an electric motor, in order to reduce turbo lag.
This differs from an electric supercharger, which solely uses an electric motor to power the compressor.
The compressor draws in outside air through the engine's intake system, pressurises it, then feeds it into the combustion chambers (via the inlet manifold).
The compressor section of the turbocharger consists of an impeller, a diffuser, and a volute housing.
The operating characteristics of a compressor are described by the compressor map.
Some turbochargers use a "ported shroud", whereby a ring of holes or circular grooves allows air to bleed around the compressor blades.
Ported shroud designs can have greater resistance to compressor surge and can improve the efficiency of the compressor wheel.
Some CHRAs are water-cooled and have pipes for the engine's coolant to flow through.
One reason for water cooling is to protect the  turbocharger's lubricating oil from overheating.
The simplest type of turbocharger is the free floating turbocharger.
This system would be able to achieve maximum boost at maximum engine revs and full throttle, however additional components are needed to produce an engine that is driveable in a range of load and rpm conditions.
Turbo lag refers to delay – when the engine rpm is within the turbocharger's operating range – that occurs between pressing the throttle and the turbocharger spooling up to provide boost pressure.
This delay is due to the increasing exhaust gas flow (after the throttle is suddenly opened) taking time to spin up the turbine to speeds where boost is produced.
The effect of turbo lag is reduced throttle response, in the form of a delay in the power delivery.
Superchargers do not suffer from turbo lag because the compressor mechanism is driven directly by the engine.
Electric turbochargers and hybrid turbochargers.
A similar phenomenon that is often mistaken for turbo lag is the boost threshold.
This is where the engine speed (rpm) is currently below the operating range of the turbocharger system, therefore the engine is unable to produce significant boost.
At low rpm, the exhaust gas flow rate is unable to spin the turbine sufficiently.
The boost threshold causes delays in the power delivery at low rpm (since the unboosted engine must accelerate the vehicle to increase the rpm above the boost threshold), while turbo lag causes delay in the power delivery at higher rpm.
Some engines use multiple turbochargers, usually to reduce turbo lag, increase the range of rpm where boost is produced, or simplify the layout of the intake/exhaust system.
The most common arrangement is twin turbochargers, however triple-turbo or quad-turbo arrangements have been occasionally used in production cars.
The key difference between a turbocharger and a supercharger is that a supercharger is mechanically driven by the engine (often through a belt connected to the crankshaft) whereas a turbocharger is powered by the kinetic energy of the engine's exhaust gas.
A turbocharger does not place a direct mechanical load on the engine, although turbochargers place exhaust back pressure on engines, increasing pumping losses.
Supercharged engines are common in applications where throttle response is a key concern, and supercharged engines are less likely to heat soak the intake air.
A combination of an exhaust-driven turbocharger and an engine-driven supercharger can mitigate the weaknesses of both.
This technique is called twincharging.
In 2017, 27% of vehicles sold in the US were turbocharged.
In Europe 67% of all vehicles were turbocharged in 2014.
Historically, more than 90% of turbochargers were diesel, however, adoption in petrol engines is increasing.
The companies which manufacture the most turbochargers in Europe and the U.S. are Garrett Motion (formerly Honeywell), BorgWarner and Mitsubishi Turbocharger.
Turbocharger failures and resultant high exhaust temperatures are among the causes of car fires.
Failure of the seals will cause oil to leak into the cylinders causing blue-gray smoke.
In diesel engines, this can cause an overspeed, a condition known as diesel engine runaway.
The turning radius (alternatively, turning diameter or turning circle) of a vehicle defines the minimum dimension (typically the radius or diameter, respectively) of available space required for that vehicle to make a semi-circular U-turn without skidding.
The Oxford English Dictionary describes turning circle as "the smallest circle within which a ship, motor vehicle, etc., can be turned round completely".
The term thus refers to a theoretical minimal circle in which for example an aeroplane, a ground vehicle or a watercraft can be turned around.
The terms (radius, diameter, or circle) can have different meanings; refer to the § Alternative nomenclature section.
On wheeled vehicles with the common type of front wheel steering (i.e. one, two or even four wheels at the front capable of steering), the vehicle's turning diameter measures the minimum space needed to turn the vehicle around while the steering is set to its maximum displacement from the central 'straight ahead' position - i.e. either extreme left or right.
If a marker pen was placed on the point of the vehicle furthest from the center of the turn, the diameter of the circle traced during the turn defines the value of that vehicle's turning diameter.
Mathematically, the turning radius would be half of the turning diameter.
Turning diameter is sometimes used in everyday language as a generalized term rather than with numerical figures.
For example, a wheeled vehicle with a very small turning circle may be described as having a "tight turning radius", meaning that it is easier to turn around very tight corners.
Wheeled vehicles with four-wheel steering will have a smaller turning radius than vehicles that steer wheels on one axle.
Technically, the minimum possible turning circle for a vehicle would be where it does not move either forwards or backwards while turning and simply pivots on its central axis.
For a rectangular vehicle capable of doing this, the smallest turning circle would be equal to the diagonal length of the vehicle.
As an example, some boats can be turned in this way, generally by using azimuth thrusters.
Some wheeled vehicles are designed to spin around their central axis by making all wheels steerable, such as certain lawnmowers and wheelchairs as they do not follow a circular path as they turn.
In this case the vehicle is referred to as a "zero turning radius" vehicle.
Some camera dollies used in the film industry have a "round" mode which allows them to spin around their z axis by allowing synchronized inverse rotation of their left and right wheel sets, effectively giving them "zero" turning radius.
Many conventionally steerable vehicles (only one axle with steerable wheels) can reverse the direction of travel in a space smaller than the stated turning radius by executing a specialized maneuver, such as a J-turn or similar skid, or in a discontinuous motion such as a three-point turn.
Other terms are sometimes used synonymously for turning diameter, which can lead to confusion.
The automotive term turning radius has been used as equivalent and interchangeable with the turning diameter.
For example, the 2017 Audi A4 is specified by the manufacturer as having a turning diameter (curb-to-curb) of 11.6 m (38 ft).
Mathematically, the radius of a circle is half the diameter, so the correct turning radius in this example would be ⁠11.6 m/2⁠
= 5.8 m. However, another source lists the turning radius of the same vehicle as also being 11.6 m, which is the turning diameter.
In practice, the values of turning diameter tend to be listed more frequently in vehicle specifications, so the term turning diameter will therefore be more correct in most cases.
The turning diameter will always give a higher number for a given vehicle, and the turning diameter measurement is usually preferred by automotive manufacturers.
Such mixing of terms can lead to confusion among consumers.
, about 6.28 times as big).
For example, Motor Trend refers to a "curb-to-curb turning circle" of a 2008 Cadillac CTS as 10.82 metres (35.5 ft), but the terminology is not yet settled.
AutoChannel.com refers to the "turning radius" of the same car as 10.82 metres (35.5 ft).
Turning circle is also sometimes used to refer to the path swept in the manoeuvre, i.e. the arc, or the circle's circumference in the case when the manoeuvre makes a complete turn.
There are two methods for measuring the vehicle turning diameter which will give slightly different results.
These two methods are called wall-to-wall and curb-to-curb (US spelling), or alternatively kerb-to-kerb (UK spelling).
The wall-to-wall turning circle is the minimum distance between two walls, both of which exceed the height of the vehicle, in which the vehicle can make a U-turn.
The kerb-to-kerb turning circle is the minimum distance between two raised curbs, both of which are lower than the lowest body protrusions, in which the vehicle can make a U-turn.
The wall-to-wall turning circle is greater than the kerb-to-kerb measure for the same vehicle because of the front and rear body overhangs.
One can find these two ways of measuring the turning circle used in auto specifications, for example, a van might be listed as having a turning circle (in meters) of 12.1 (C) / 12.4 (W).
A curb or curb-to-curb turning circle will show the straight-line distance from one side of the circle to the other, through the center.
The name "curb-to-curb" indicates that a street would have to be this wide before this car can make a U-turn and not hit a street curb with a wheel.
If you took the street curb and built it higher, as high as the car, and tried to make a U-turn in the street, parts of the car (bumper) would hit the wall.
The kerb-to-kerb turning circle can be smaller than the turning circle as it refers to only a partial circle (~180°) with the vehicle alongside one kerb to start with.
To perform a U turn in a forward direction only, the centre of the turn is not coincident with the centre of the road - thus a complete circle would not be possible (without driving onto the pavement to complete the manoeuvre).
It also does not take into account that part of the vehicle that overhangs the wheels where as 'turning circle' does.
The name wall or wall-to-wall turning circle denotes how far apart the two walls would have to be to allow a U-turn without scraping the walls.
Road vehicles must be able to carry out a 360 degrees turn on an annulus with an outer radius of 12.5 metres (41 ft) and an inner radius of 5.3 metres (17 ft), measured wall-to-wall.
In addition, when entering this annulus, no part of the vehicle can overreach a tangent by more than 80 centimetres (31 in); this tangent is drawn at the outer, 12.5 m limit of the annulus.
New Zealand requires that road vehicles can perform a 360 degrees turn on a circle with a 25 metres (82 ft) diameter, measured wall-to-wall.
The only part of the vehicle that may reach over this limitation are collapsible mirrors.
Two-wheel-drive (2WD) denotes vehicles with a drivetrain that allows two wheels to be driven, and receive power and torque from the engine, simultaneously.
For four-wheeled vehicles (and by extension, vehicles with six, eight, or more wheels), this term is used to describe vehicles that are able to power at most two wheels, referred to as either front, or rear-wheel-drive.
The term 4x2 is also used, to denote four total wheels with two being driven.
Most road vehicles use a 2WD layout due to its lightweight and simplicity.
Traction on the road is usually sufficient that the driving force can be reliably transmitted through only two wheels.
For vehicles that have part-time four-wheel drive, the term refers to the mode when 4WD is deactivated and power is applied to only two wheels.
For two-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycles and bicycles, the term is used to describe vehicles that can power the front as well as the back wheel.
The term 2x2 is also used to denote two total wheels with both being driven.
2x2 vehicles are typically either mechanically driven, via a chain, belt, or shaft, or are hydraulic-driven.
This scheme greatly improves offroad performance, but is quite complicated and requires more power to operate, thus most 2WD machines are either "exotic" bikes for enthusiasts or created with special uses in mind.
Manufacturers who have one in production include Rokon, Jeep, Tarus and Christini.
Manufacturers who are working or have worked on a prototype include ZID, Suzuki, Yamaha, KTM, Honda, and Nissan.
For three-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycles with sidecars, the term is used to describe vehicles that can power the sidecar as well as the back wheel.
Sidecar-drive vehicles are typically mechanically driven via a shaft and may or may not have a differential.
This scheme greatly improves offroad performance, but is more complicated and requires more power to operate, thus most 2WD machines are vehicles created with special uses in mind such as trials or military use.
The first use of the sidecar drive appears in 1928 with the apparent independent invention of Baughan in the UK, and Mokharov in the USSR.
A tram (also known as a streetcar or trolley in the United States and Canada) is a type of urban rail transit consisting of rail vehicles, either individual railcars or self-propelled trains coupled into multiple units that run on tramway tracks on urban public streets; some include segments on segregated right-of-way.
The tramlines or tram networks operated as public transport are called tramways or simply trams/streetcars.
Trams are now commonly included in the wider term light rail, which also includes grade-separated systems.
Tram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than main line and rapid transit trains.
Today, most trams use electrical power, usually fed by a pantograph sliding on an overhead line; older systems may use a trolley pole or a bow collector.
In some cases, a contact shoe on a third rail is used.
If necessary, they may have dual power systems—electricity in city streets and diesel in more rural environments.
Occasionally, trams also carry freight.
Some trams, known as tram-trains, may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks, similar to interurban systems.
The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct and a given system may combine multiple features.
One of the advantages over earlier forms of transit was the low rolling resistance of metal wheels on steel rails, allowing the trams to haul a greater load for a given effort.
Another factor which contributed to the rise of trams was the high total cost of ownership of horses.
Electric trams largely replaced animal power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Improvements in other vehicles such as buses led to decline of trams in the mid 20th century.
However, trams have seen resurgence since the 1990s.
The history of passenger trams, streetcars and trolley systems, began in the early nineteenth century.
It can be divided into several distinct periods defined by the principal means of power used.
Precursors to the tramway included the wooden or stone wagonways that were used in central Europe to transport mine carts with unflanged wheels since the 1500s, and the paved limestone trackways designed by the Romans for heavy horse and ox-drawn transportation.
By the 1700s, paved plateways with cast iron rails were introduced in England for transporting coal, stone or iron ore from the mines to the urban factories and docks.
The Swansea and Mumbles Railway (see below) originally operated as an industrial tramway from 1804-07.
The world's first passenger train or tram was the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, in Wales, UK.
The British Parliament passed the Mumbles Railway Act in 1804, and horse-drawn service started in 1807.
The service closed in 1827, but was restarted in 1860, again using horses.
It was worked by steam from 1877, and then, from 1929, by very large (106-seater) electric tramcars, until closure in 1960.
The Swansea and Mumbles Railway was something of a one-off however, and no street tramway appeared in Britain until 1860 when one was built in Birkenhead by the American George Francis Train.
Street railways developed in America before Europe, largely due to the poor paving of the streets in American cities which made them unsuitable for horsebuses, which were then common on the well-paved streets of European cities.
Running the horsecars on rails allowed for a much smoother ride.
There are records of a street railway running in Baltimore as early as 1828, however the first authenticated streetcar in America, was the New York and Harlem Railroad developed by the Irish coach builder John Stephenson, in New York City which began service in the year 1832.
The New York and Harlem Railroad's Fourth Avenue Line ran along the Bowery and Fourth Avenue in New York City.
It was followed in 1835 by the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad in New Orleans, Louisiana, which still operates as the St. Charles Streetcar Line.
Other American cities did not follow until the 1850s, after which the "animal railway" became an increasingly common feature in the larger towns.
The first permanent tram line in continental Europe was opened in Paris in 1855 by Alphonse Loubat who had previously worked on American streetcar lines.
The tram was developed in numerous cities of Europe (some of the most extensive systems were found in Berlin, Budapest, Birmingham, Saint Petersburg, Lisbon, London, Manchester, Paris, Kyiv).
The first tram in South America opened in 1858 in Santiago, Chile.
The first trams in Australia opened in 1860 in Sydney.
Africa's first tram service started in Alexandria on 8 January 1863.
The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in Batavia (now Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia).
Problems with horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing of.
Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar.
In 1905 the British newspaper Newcastle Daily Chronicle reported that, "A large number of London's discarded horse tramcars have been sent to Lincolnshire where they are used as sleeping rooms for potato pickers".
Horsecars were largely replaced by electric-powered trams following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on trams for collecting electricity from overhead wires by Frank J. Sprague.
His spring-loaded trolley pole used a wheel to travel along the wire.
In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system in Richmond, Virginia.
Within a year, the economy of electric power had replaced more costly horsecars in many cities.
By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents.
Horses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century, and many large metropolitan lines lasted into the early 20th century.
New York City had a regular horsecar service on the Bleecker Street Line until its closure in 1917.
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had its Sarah Street line drawn by horses until 1923.
The last regular mule-drawn cars in the US ran in Sulphur Rock, Arkansas, until 1926 and were commemorated by a U.S. postage stamp issued in 1983.
The last mule tram service in Mexico City ended in 1932, and a mule tram in Celaya, Mexico, survived until 1954.
The last horse-drawn tram to be withdrawn from public service in the UK took passengers from Fintona railway station to Fintona Junction one mile away on the main Omagh to Enniskillen railway in Northern Ireland.
The tram made its last journey on 30 September 1957 when the Omagh to Enniskillen line closed.
The "van" now lies at the Ulster Transport Museum.
Horse-drawn trams still operate on the 1876-built Douglas Bay Horse Tramway on the Isle of Man, and at the 1894-built  horse tram at Victor Harbor in South Australia.
New horse-drawn systems have been established at the Hokkaidō Museum in Japan and also in Disneyland.
A horse-tram route in Polish gmina Mrozy, first built in 1902, was reopened in 2012.
The first mechanical trams were powered by steam.
Generally, there were two types of steam tram.
The first and most common had a small steam locomotive (called a tram engine in the UK) at the head of a line of one or more carriages, similar to a small train.
Systems with such steam trams included Christchurch, New Zealand; Sydney, Australia; other city systems in New South Wales; Munich, Germany (from August 1883 on), British India (from 1885) and the Dublin & Blessington Steam Tramway (from 1888) in Ireland.
Steam tramways also were used on the suburban tramway lines around Milan and Padua; the last Gamba de Legn ("Peg-Leg") tramway ran on the Milan-Magenta-Castano Primo route in late 1957.
The other style of steam tram had the steam engine in the body of the tram, referred to as a tram engine (UK) or steam dummy (US).
The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris.
French-designed steam trams also operated in Rockhampton, in the Australian state of Queensland between 1909 and 1939.
Stockholm, Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of Södermalm between 1887 and 1901.
Tram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas.
The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter.
Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam.
Usually the engines used coke rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; condensers or superheating were used to avoid emitting visible steam.
A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered.
Steam tram engines faded out around the 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams.
Another motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a fixed track by a moving steel cable.
The power to move the cable was normally provided at a "powerhouse" site a distance away from the actual vehicle.
The London and Blackwall Railway, which opened for passengers in east London, England, in 1840 used such a system.
The first practical cable car line was tested in San Francisco, in 1873.
Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable cable grip mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage.
The second city to operate cable trams was Dunedin, from 1881 to 1957.
The most extensive cable system in the US was built in Chicago, having been built in stages between 1859 and 1892.
New York City developed multiple cable car lines, that operated from 1883 to 1909.
Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.
From 1885 to 1940, the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on 75 kilometres (47 mi) of track.
There were also two isolated cable lines in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900, and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905.
In Dresden, Germany, in 1901 an elevated suspended cable car following the Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system started operating.
Cable cars operated on Highgate Hill in North London and Kennington to Brixton Hill in South London.
They also worked around "Upper Douglas" in the Isle of Man from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet).
In Italy, in Trieste, the Trieste–Opicina tramway was opened in 1902, with the steepest section of the route being negotiated with the help of a funicular and its cables.
Cable cars suffered from high infrastructure costs, since an expensive system of cables, pulleys, stationary engines and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided.
They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars.
The cable had to be disconnected ("dropped") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line.
The cable then had to be "picked up" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism.
Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired.
Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) had to be replaced on a regular schedule.
After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.
Cable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels did not lose traction as they climbed or descended a steep hill.
The moving cable pulled the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car.
Cable cars do have wheel brakes and track brakes, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed.
Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.
The San Francisco cable cars, though significantly reduced in number, continue to perform a regular transportation function, in addition to being a well-known tourist attraction.
A single cable line also survives in Wellington (rebuilt in 1979 as a funicular but still called the "Wellington Cable Car").
Another system, actually two separate cable lines with a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of Llandudno up to the top of the Great Orme hill in North Wales, UK.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, naphtha gas or coal gas in particular.
Gas trams are known to have operated between Alphington and Clifton Hill in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia (1886–1888); in Berlin and Dresden, Germany; in Estonia (1921–1951); between Jelenia Góra, Cieplice, and Sobieszów in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at Lytham St Annes, Trafford Park, Manchester (1897–1908) and Neath, Wales (1896–1920).
On 29 December 1886 the Melbourne newspaper The Argus reprinted a report from the San Francisco Bulletin that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'.
The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a cable grip car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'.
The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'.
Comparatively little has been published about gas trams.
However, research on the subject was carried out for an article in the October 2011 edition of "The Times", the historical journal of the Australian Association of Timetable Collectors, now the Australian Timetable Association.
A tram system powered by compressed natural gas was due to open in Malaysia in 2012, but the news about the project appears to have dried up.
The world's first electric tram line operated in Sestroretsk near Saint Petersburg invented and tested by inventor Fyodor Pirotsky in 1875.
Later, using a similar technology, Pirotsky put into service the first public electric tramway in St. Petersburg, which operated only during September 1880.
The second demonstrative tramway was presented by Siemens & Halske at the 1879 Berlin Industrial Exposition.
The first public electric tramway used for permanent service was the Gross-Lichterfelde tramway in Lichterfelde near Berlin in Germany, which opened in 1881.
It was built by Werner von Siemens who contacted Pirotsky.
This was the world's first commercially successful electric tram.
It initially drew current from the rails, with overhead wire being installed in 1883.
In Britain, Volk's Electric Railway was opened in 1883 in Brighton.
This two kilometer line along the seafront, re-gauged to 2 ft 8+1⁄2 in (825 mm) in 1884, remains in service to this day and is the oldest operating electric tramway in the world.
Also in 1883, Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram was opened near Vienna in Austria.
It was the first tram in the world in regular service that was run with electricity served by an overhead line with pantograph current collectors.
The Blackpool Tramway was opened in Blackpool, UK on 29 September 1885 using conduit collection along Blackpool Promenade.
This system is still in operation in a modernised form.
The earliest tram system in Canada was built by John Joseph Wright, brother of the famous mining entrepreneur Whitaker Wright, in Toronto in 1883, introducing electric trams in 1892.
In the US, multiple functioning experimental electric trams were exhibited at the 1884 World Cotton Centennial World's Fair in New Orleans, Louisiana, but they were not deemed good enough to replace the Lamm fireless engines then propelling the St. Charles Avenue Streetcar in that city.
The first commercial installation of an electric streetcar in the United States was built in 1884 in Cleveland, Ohio, and operated for a period of one year by the East Cleveland Street Railway Company.
The first city-wide electric streetcar system, was implemented in 1886 in Montgomery, Alabama, by the Capital City Street Railway Company, and ran for 50 years.
In 1888, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway began to operate trams in Richmond, Virginia, that Frank J. Sprague had built.
Sprague later developed multiple unit control, first demonstrated in Chicago in 1897, allowing multiple cars to be coupled together and operated by a single motorman.
This gave rise to the modern subway train.
Following the improvement of an overhead "trolley" system on streetcars for collecting electricity from overhead wires by Sprague, electric tram systems were rapidly adopted across the world.
Earlier electric trains proved difficult or unreliable and experienced limited success until the second half of the 1880s, when new types of current collectors were developed.
Siemens' line, for example, provided power through a live rail and a return rail, like a model train, limiting the voltage that could be used, and delivering electric shocks to people and animals crossing the tracks.
Siemens later designed his own version of overhead current collection, called the bow collector.
One of the first systems to use it was in Thorold, Ontario, opened in 1887, and it was considered quite successful at the time.
While this line proved quite versatile as one of the earliest fully functional electric streetcar installations, it required horse-drawn support while climbing the Niagara Escarpment and for two months of the winter when hydroelectricity was not available.
It continued in service in its original form into the 1950s.
Sidney Howe Short designed and produced the first electric motor that operated a streetcar without gears.
The motor had its armature direct-connected to the streetcar's axle for the driving force.
Short pioneered "use of a conduit system of concealed feed" thereby eliminating the necessity of overhead wire and a trolley pole for street cars and railways.
While at the University of Denver he conducted important experiments which established that multiple unit powered cars were a better way to operate trains and trolleys.
Helsinki, Finland; and Madrid and Barcelona, Spain, in 1899.
Sarajevo built a citywide system of electric trams in 1895.
Budapest established its tramway system in 1887, and its ring line has grown to be the busiest tram line in Europe, with a tram running every 60 seconds at rush hour.
Bucharest and Belgrade ran a regular service from 1894.
Ljubljana introduced its tram system in 1901 – it closed in 1958.
Oslo had the first tramway in Scandinavia, starting operation on 2 March 1894.
By the 1970s, the only full tramway system remaining in Australia was the Melbourne tram system.
However, there were also a few single lines remaining elsewhere: the Glenelg tram line, connecting Adelaide to the beachside suburb of Glenelg, and tourist trams in the Victorian Goldfields cities of Bendigo and Ballarat.
In recent years the Melbourne system, generally recognised as the largest urban tram network in the world, has been considerably modernised and expanded.
The Adelaide line has also been extended to the Entertainment Centre, and work is progressing on further extensions.
Sydney re-introduced trams (or light rail) on 31 August 1997.
A completely new system, known as G:link, was introduced on the Gold Coast, Queensland, on 20 July 2014.
The Newcastle Light Rail opened in February 2019, while the Canberra light rail opened on 20 April 2019.
This is the first time that there have been trams in Canberra, even though Walter Burley Griffin's 1914–1920 plans for the capital then in the planning stage did propose a Canberra tram system.
In Japan, the Kyoto Electric railroad was the first tram system, starting operation in 1895.
By 1932, the network had grown to 82 railway companies in 65 cities, with a total network length of 1,479 km (919 mi).
By the 1960s the tram had generally died out in Japan.
The convenience and economy of electricity resulted in its rapid adoption once the technical problems of production and transmission of electricity were solved.
Electric trams largely replaced animal power and other forms of motive power including cable and steam, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
There was one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley pole off an overhead line on the early electrified systems.
Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails.
In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as interior lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts DC.
In British terminology, such a tram was said to be 'grounded'—not to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite.
Any person stepping off the tram and completing the earth return circuit with their body could receive a serious electric shock.
In such an event, the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley pole, before allowing passengers off the tram.
Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram, the water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.
With improved technology, this is not anymore an issue.
As early as 1834, Thomas Davenport, a Vermont blacksmith, had invented a battery-powered electric motor which he later patented.
The following year he used it to operate a small model electric car on a short section of track four feet in diameter.
Attempts to use batteries as a source of electricity were made from the 1880s and 1890s, with unsuccessful trials conducted in among other places Bendigo and Adelaide in Australia, and for about 14 years as The Hague accutram of HTM in the Netherlands.
The first trams in Bendigo, Australia, in 1892, were battery-powered, but within as little as three months they were replaced with horse-drawn trams.
In New York City some minor lines also used storage batteries.
Then, comparatively recently, during the 1950s, a longer battery-operated tramway line ran from Milan to Bergamo.
In China there is a Nanjing battery Tram line and has been running since 2014.
More recently in 2019, the West Midlands Metro in Birmingham, England, has adopted battery-powered trams on sections through the city centre close to Grade I listed Birmingham Town Hall.
Paris and Berne (Switzerland) operated trams that were powered by compressed air using the Mekarski system.
Trials on street tramways in Britain, including by the North Metropolitan Tramway Company between Kings Cross and Holloway, London (1883), achieved acceptable results but were found not to be economic because of the combined coal consumption of the stationary compressor and the onboard steam boiler.
The Convict Tramway was hauled by human power in the form of convicts from the Port Arthur convict settlement.
and was created to replace the hazardous sea voyage from Hobart to Port Arthur, Tasmania.
Charles O'Hara Booth oversaw the construction of the tramway.
It opened in 1836 and ran for 8 km (5.0 mi) from Oakwood to Taranna.
By most definitions, the tramway was the first passenger-carrying railway/tramway in Australia.
An unconfirmed report says that it continued to Eaglehawk Neck and, if this was so, the length of the tramway would have been more than doubled.
The tramway carried passengers and freight, and ran on wooden rails.
The gauge is unknown.
The date of closure is unknown, but it was certainly prior to 1877.
In March 2015, China South Rail Corporation (CSR) demonstrated the world's first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao.
The chief engineer of the CSR subsidiary CSR Sifang Co Ltd., Liang Jianying, said that the company is studying how to reduce the running costs of the tram.
The Trieste–Opicina tramway in Trieste operates a hybrid funicular tramway system.
Conventional electric trams are operated in street running and on reserved track for most of their route.
However, on one steep segment of track, they are assisted by cable tractors, which push the trams uphill and act as brakes for the downhill run.
For safety, the cable tractors are always deployed on the downhill side of the tram vehicle.
Similar systems were used elsewhere in the past, notably on the Queen Anne Counterbalance in Seattle and the Darling Street wharf line in Sydney.
Hastings and some other tramways, for example Stockholms Spårvägar in Sweden and some lines in Karachi, used petrol trams.
Galveston Island Trolley in Texas operated diesel trams due to the city's hurricane-prone location, which would have resulted in frequent damage to an electrical supply system.
Although Portland, Victoria promotes its tourist tram as being a cable car it actually operates using a hidden diesel motor.
The tram, which runs on a circular route around the town of Portland, uses dummies and salons formerly used on the extensive Melbourne cable tramway system and now beautifully restored.
In the mid-20th century many tram systems were disbanded, replaced by buses, trolleybuses, automobiles or rapid transit.
The General Motors streetcar conspiracy was a case study of the decline of trams in the United States.
In the 21st century, trams have been re-introduced in cities where they had been closed down for decades (such as Tramlink in London), or kept in heritage use (such as Spårväg City in Stockholm).
Most trams made from the 1990s onwards (such as the Bombardier Flexity series and Alstom Citadis) are articulated low-floor trams with features such as regenerative braking.
There are two main types of tramways, the classic tramway built in the early 20th century with the tram system operating in mixed traffic, and the later type which is most often associated with the tram system having its own right of way.
Tram systems that have their own right of way are often called light rail but this does not always hold true.
Though these two systems differ in their operation, their equipment is much the same.
Trams were traditionally operated with separate levers for applying power and brakes.
More modern vehicles use a locomotive-style controller which incorporate a dead man's switch.
The success of the PCC streetcar had also seen trams use automobile-style foot controls allowing hands-free operation, particularly when the driver was responsible for fare collection.
Electric trams use various devices to collect power from overhead lines.
The most common device found today is the pantograph, while some older systems use trolley poles or bow collectors.
Ground-level power supply has become a recent innovation.
Another new technology uses supercapacitors; when an insulator at a track switch cuts off power from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use energy stored in a large capacitor to drive the tram past the gap in the power feed.
A rather obsolete system for power supply is conduit current collection.
The old tram systems in London, Manhattan (New York City), and Washington, D.C., used live rails, like those on third-rail electrified railways, but in a conduit underneath the road, from which they drew power through a plough.
It was called Conduit current collection.
Washington's was the last of these to close, in 1962.
Today, no commercial tramway uses this system.
More recently, a modern equivalent to these systems has been developed which allows for the safe installation of a third rail on city streets, which is known as surface current collection or ground-level power supply; the main example of this is the new tramway in Bordeaux.
A ground-level power supply system also known as surface current collection or alimentation par le sol (APS) is an updated version of the original stud type system.
APS uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre powered segments with three-metre neutral sections between.
Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energize the power rail segments as the tram passes over them.
Older systems required mechanical switching systems which were susceptible to environmental problems.
At any one time no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live.
Wireless and solid state switching remove the mechanical problem.
Alstom developed the system primarily to avoid intrusive power supply cables in the sensitive area of the old city of old Bordeaux.
Most systems start by building up a strongly nucleated radial pattern of routes linking the city centre with residential suburbs and traffic hubs such as railway stations and hospitals, usually following main roads.
Some of these, such as those in Hong Kong, Blackpool and Bergen, still essentially comprise a single route.
Some suburbs may be served by loop lines connecting two adjacent radial roads.
Some modern systems have started by reusing existing radial railway tracks, as in Nottingham and Birmingham, sometimes joining them together by a section of street track through the city centre, as in Manchester.
Later developments often include tangential routes linking adjacent suburbs directly, or multiple routes through the town centre to avoid congestion (as in Manchester's Second City Crossing).
Other new systems, particularly those in large cities which already have well-developed metro and suburban railway systems, such as London and Paris, have started by building isolated suburban lines feeding into railway or metro stations.
In Paris these have then been linked by ring lines.
A third, weakly nucleated, route pattern may grow up where a number of nearby small settlements are linked, such as in the coal-mining areas served by BOGESTRA or the Silesian Interurbans.
A fourth starting point may be a loop in the city centre, sometimes called a downtown circulator, as in Portland or El Paso.
Occasionally a modern tramway system may grow from a preserved heritage line, as in Stockholm.
The resulting route patterns are very different.
Some have a rational structure, covering their catchment area as efficiently as possible, with new suburbs being planned with tramlines integral to their layout – such is the case in Amsterdam.
Bordeaux and Montpellier have built comprehensive networks, based on radial routes with numerous interconnections, within the last two decades.
Some systems serve only parts of their cities, with Berlin being the prime example, owing to the fact that trams survived the city's political division only in the Eastern part.
Other systems have ended up with a rather random route map, for instance when some previous operating companies have ceased operation (as with the tramways vicinaux/buurtspoorwegen in Brussels) or where isolated outlying lines have been preserved (as on the eastern fringe of Berlin).
In Rome, the remnant of the system comprises 3 isolated radial routes, not connecting in the ancient city centre, but linked by a ring route.
Some apparently anomalous lines continue in operation where a new line would not on rational grounds be built, because it is much more costly to build a new line than to continue operating an existing one.
In some places, the opportunity is taken when roads are being repaved to lay tramlines (though without erecting overhead cables) even though no service is immediately planned: such is the case in Leipzigerstraße in Berlin, the Haarlemmer Houttuinen in Amsterdam, and Botermarkt in Ghent.
Tram systems operate across national borders in Basel (from Switzerland into France and Germany), Geneva (from Switzerland into France) and Strasbourg (from France into Germany).
A planned line linking Hasselt (Belgium) with Maastricht (Netherlands) was cancelled in June 2022.
Where tracks diverge, the driver chooses the route, usually either by flicking a switch on the dashboard or by use of the power pedal – generally if power is applied the tram goes straight on, whereas if no power is applied the tram turns.
Some systems use automatic point-setting systems, where the route for each journey is downloaded from a central computer, and an onboard computer actuates each point as it comes to it via an induction loop.
Such is the case at Manchester Metrolink.
If the powered system breaks down, most points may be operated manually, by inserting a metal lever ('point iron') into the point machine.
Tramway track can have different rail profiles to accommodate the various operating environments of the vehicle.
They may be embedded into concrete for street-running operation, or use standard ballasted track with railroad ties on high-speed sections.
A more ecological solution is to embed tracks into grass turf, an approach known as green track.
Tramway tracks use a grooved rail with a groove designed for tramway or railway track in pavement or grassed surfaces (grassed track or track in a lawn).
The rail has the railhead on one side and the guard on the other.
The guard provides accommodation for the flange.
The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail.
Grooved rail was invented in 1852 by Alphonse Loubat, a French inventor who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris.
The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove.
The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or after a period of idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a "scrubber" tram.
Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.
In narrow situations double-track tram lines sometimes reduce to single track, or, to avoid switches, have the tracks interlaced, e.g. in the Leidsestraat in Amsterdam on three short stretches (see map detail); this is known as interlaced or gauntlet track.
There is a UK example of interlaced track on the Tramlink, just west of Mitcham Station, where the formation is narrowed by an old landslip causing an obstruction.
(See photo in Tramlink entry).
Historically, the track gauge has had considerable variations, with narrow gauge common in many early systems.
However, most light rail systems are now standard gauge.
An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than custom-built machinery.
Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives.
Another factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout.
Standard gauge also enables – at least in theory – a larger choice of manufacturers and thus lower procurement costs for new vehicles.
However, other factors such as electrification or loading gauge for which there is more variation may require costly custom built units regardless.
Tram stops may be similar to bus stops in design and use, particularly in street-running sections, where in some cases other vehicles are legally required to stop clear of the tram doors.
Some stops may resemble to railway platforms, particularly in private right-of-way sections and where trams are boarded at standard railway platform height, as opposed to using steps at the doorway or low-floor trams.
Approximately 5,000 new trams are manufactured each year.
As of February 2017, 4,478 new trams were on order from their makers, with options being open for a further 1,092.
Trams (and road public transport in general) can be much more efficient in terms of road usage than cars – one vehicle replaces about 40 cars (which take up a far larger area of road space).
Vehicles run more efficiently compared to similar vehicles that use rubber tyres, since the rolling resistance of steel on steel is lower than rubber on asphalt.
Being guided by rails means that even very long tram units can navigate tight, winding city streets that are inaccessible to long buses.
Tram vehicles are very durable, with some being in continuous revenue service for more than fifty years.
This is especially true compared to internal combustion buses, which tend to require high amounts of maintenance and break down after less than 20 years, mostly due to the vibrations of the engine.
In many cases tram networks have a higher capacity than similar buses.
This has been cited as a reason for the replacement of one of Europe's busiest bus lines (with three-minute headways in peak times) with a tram by Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe.
Due to the above-mentioned capacity advantage, labor costs (which form the biggest share of operating costs of many public transit systems) per passenger can be significantly lower compared to buses.
Trams and light rail systems can be cheaper to install than subways or other forms of heavy rail.
In Berlin the commonly cited figure is that one kilometer of subway costs as much as ten kilometers of tramway.
ULR Ultra Light Rail developments with prefabricated track and onboard power (no OHL Over Head Line) in the UK are aiming for £10 m per km as opposed to convention tram rail and OHL at £20–£30 m per km.
Tramways can take advantage of old heavy rail alignments some examples include the Manchester Metrolink of which the Bury Line was part of the East Lancashire Railway.
Other examples can be found in Paris, London, Boston, Melbourne and Sydney.
They hence sometimes take advantage of high speed track while on train tracks.
As tram lines are permanent this allows local authorities to redevelop and revitalise their towns and cities provided suitable planning changes are made.
Melbourne will allow higher buildings (5 to 6 story) along tram routes leaving the existing suburbs behind unchanged whilst doubling the cities density.
The tram with its fixed route gives developers confidence to invest as opposed to a changeable bus route.
Trams produce less air pollution than rubber tyred transport which produce tyre, asphalt and brake based pollutants.
The use of regenerative electric motor braking in trams lowers mechanical brake use.
Steel wheel and rail particulates are produced but regular wheel alignment and flexible track mounting can reduce emissions.
Tram networks can link to other operational heavy rail and rapid transit systems, allowing vehicles to move directly from one to the other without passengers needing to alight.
Trams that are compatible with heavy rail systems are called tram-trains, while those that can use subway tunnels are called pre-metro or Stadtbahn.
Passengers can reach surface stations quicker than underground stations.
Subjective safety at surface stations is often seen to be higher.
Trams can be tourist attractions in ways buses usually are not.
Many modern tram systems plant low growing vegetation – mostly grasses – between the tracks which has a psychological effect on perceived noise levels and the benefits of greenspace.
This is not possible for buses as they deviate too much from an "ideal" track in daily operations.
There is a well studied effect that the installation of a tram service – even if service frequency, speed and price all remain constant – leads to higher ridership and mode shift away from cars compared to buses.
Conversely, the abandonment of tram service leads to measurable declines in ridership.
Installing rails for tram tracks and overhead lines for power means a higher up-front cost than using buses which require no modifications to streets to begin operations.
Tram tracks can be hazardous for cyclists, as bikes, particularly those with narrow tyres, may get their wheels caught in the track grooves.
It is possible to close the grooves of the tracks on critical sections by rubber profiles that are pressed down by the wheelflanges of the passing tram but that cannot be lowered by the weight of a cyclist.
If not well-maintained, however, these lose their effectiveness over time.
When wet, tram tracks tend to become slippery and thus dangerous for bicycles and motorcycles, especially in traffic.
In some cases, even cars can be affected.
The opening of new tram and light rail systems has sometimes been accompanied by a marked increase in car accidents, as a result of drivers' unfamiliarity with the physics and geometry of trams.
Though such increases may be temporary, long-term conflicts between motorists and light rail operations can be alleviated by segregating their respective rights-of-way and installing appropriate signage and warning systems.
Rail transport can expose neighbouring populations to moderate levels of low-frequency noise.
However, transportation planners use noise mitigation strategies to minimise these effects.
Most of all, the potential for decreased private motor vehicle operations along the tram's service line because of the service provision could result in lower ambient noise levels than without.
The overhead power lines and supporting poles utilized by trams (except for those using a third rail) can be unsightly and contribute to visual pollution.
Trams are in a period of growth, with about 800 tram systems operating around the world, 10 or so new systems being opened each year, and many being gradually extended.
Some of these systems date from the late 19th or early 20th centuries.
In the past 20 years their numbers have been augmented by modern tramway or light rail systems in cities that had discarded this form of transport.
There have also been some new tram systems in cities that never previously had them.
Tramways with tramcars (British English) or street railways with streetcars (North American English) were common throughout the industrialised world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but they had disappeared from most British, Canadian, French and US cities by the mid-20th century.
By contrast, trams in parts of continental Europe continued to be used by many cities, although there were contractions in some countries, including the Netherlands.
Since 1980 trams have returned to favour in many places, partly because their tendency to dominate the roadway, formerly seen as a disadvantage, is now considered to be a merit since it raises the visibility of public transport (encouraging car users to change their mode of travel), and enables streets to be reconfigured to give more space to pedestrians, making cites more pleasant places to live.
New systems have been built in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, France, Australia and many other countries.
In Milan, Italy, the old "Ventotto" trams are considered by its inhabitants a "symbol" of the city.
The same can be said of trams in Melbourne in general, but particularly the iconic W class.
The Toronto streetcar system had similarly become an iconic symbol of the city, operating the largest network in the Americas as well as the only large-scale tram system in Canada (not including light rail systems, or heritage lines).
The longest single tram line and route in the world is the 68 km (42 mi) interurban Belgian Coast Tram (Kusttram), which runs almost the entire length of the Belgian coast.
Another fairly long interurban line is the Valley Metro Rail in agglomeration of Phoenix, Arizona, with its 42 km (26 mi).
The world's longest urban (intracity) tram line is 33 km (21 mi) counter-ring routes 5/5a in Kazan (Tatarstan, Russia).
The longest systems are in Melbourne (254 km or 158 mi), Saint Petersburg (228 km or 142 mi), Katowice (Upper Silesian Industrial Region) (200 km or 120 mi), Cologne (193 km or 120 mi), Berlin (192 km or 119 mi), Milan (182 km or 113 mi), Budapest (172 km or 107 mi), and Vienna (170 km or 110 mi).
The most intensely used networks (passengers per km of, per year) are: Istanbul, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sarajevo.
Between 1997 and 2014, 400–450 vehicles have been built per year.
As of October 2015, Hong Kong has the world's only exclusively double-decker tramway system.
The most intensively used junction in any tram network is the Lazarská x Spálená junction in Prague with appx.
150 vehicles passing through per hour.
World's longest 9-sectioned 56 metres (184 ft)-meter articulated tram vehicle CAF Urbos 3/9 started operation in Budapest in 2016.
Škoda ForCity vehicles family allows expansion of length up to 72 metres (236 ft) with 539 passengers.
Historically, the Paris Tram System was, at its peak, the world's largest system, with 1,111 km (690 mi) of track in 1925 (according to other sources, ca.
640 km (400 mi) of route length in 1930).
However it was completely closed in 1938.
The next largest system appears to have been 857 km (533 mi), in Buenos Aires before 19 February 1963.
The third largest was Chicago, with over 850 km (530 mi) of track, but it was all converted to trolleybus and bus services by 21 June 1958.
Before its decline, the BVG in Berlin operated a very large network with 634 km (394 mi) of route.
Before its system started to be converted to trolleybus (and later bus) services in the 1930s (last tramway closed 6 July 1952), the first-generation London network had 555 km (345 mi) of route in 1931.
In 1958 trams in Rio de Jainero were employed on (433 km; 269 mi) of track.
The final line, the Santa Teresa route was closed in 1968.
During a period in the 1980s, the world's largest tram system was in Leningrad (now known as St. Petersburg) with 350 km (220 mi), USSR, and was included as such in the Guinness World Records; however Saint Petersburg's tram system has declined in size since the fall of the Soviet Union.
Vienna in 1960 had 340 km (211 mi), before the expansion of bus services and the opening of a subway (1976).
Substituting subway services for tram routes continues.
320 km (199 mi) was in Minneapolis–Saint Paul in 1947:
There streetcars ended 31 October 1953 in Minneapolis and 19 June 1954 in St. Paul.
The Sydney tram network, before it was closed on 25 February 1961, had 291 km (181 mi) of route, and was thus the largest in Australia.
As from 1961, the Melbourne system (currently recognised as the world's largest) took over Sydney's title as the largest network in Australia.
Tramway systems were well established in the Asian region at the start of the 20th century but started a steady decline during the mid to late 1930s.
The 1960s marked the end of its dominance in public transportation with most major systems closed and the equipment and rails sold for scrap; however, some extensive original systems still remain in service in Japan.
In recent years there has been renewed interest in the tram with modern systems being built in Japan and China.
Tram services in China exist in several cities during the 20th century; however, by the end of the century, only the systems in Dalian, Hong Kong, and Changchun remained extant.
However, the 21st century has seen a resurgence in the development of tram transport as China struggles with urban traffic congestion and pollution with at least 15 systems operating.
Hong Kong has an exclusive fleet of double-decker trams.
As of 2019, Wuyishan, Baoshan, Jiaxing, and Haikou have new tram systems under construction.
The first Japanese tram line was inaugurated in 1895 as the Kyoto Electric Railroad.
The tram reached its zenith in 1932 when 82 rail companies operated 1,479 kilometres of track in 65 cities.
The tram declined in popularity through the remaining years of the 1930s and during the 1960s many of the remaining operational tramways were shut down or converted into commuter railway lines.
In India, the tram service in Kolkata is the only active service, with a gauge up to 30 km (19 mi) across the city.
Trams were discontinued in Chennai in 1954 and in Mumbai in 1960.
Tram service was started in 1884 in Karachi but was closed in 1975.
The Northern and Central areas of the City of Colombo in Sri Lanka had an electric Tram Car system (3 ft 6 in or 1,067 mm gauge).
This system commenced operations about 1900 and was discontinued by 1960.
However, a new tram system is in the process of being brought to Colombo as part of the plan of Western Region Megapolis.
The 13-kilometre-long Jerusalem Light Rail system began operation in August 2011 and is currently being extended, with the full system expected to be in operation by 2023.
A significant portion of it will be underground.
A light rail system for Beersheba is also currently planned.
In Thailand, an extensive tram system ran in Bangkok from 1888, until it was suspended in 1968.
A smaller single-route tram route tram in Lopburi was also suspended in the early 1960s.
Other countries with discontinued tram systems include Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, and Vietnam.
However, a tram system is planned for construction in Gwadar, Pakistan, where construction started in late 2011.
Trams are also under construction in DHA City, Karachi.
Several Tram systems are under construction and proposal in Taiwan, Mostly in Kaohsiung (Phase III) and Taipei (New Taipei City).
The First LRT system was established in Kaohsiung (Circular LRT), followed by the Danhai Light Rail Transit in Northern Taiwan.
In Batavia (now Jakarta), the capital of the former Dutch colony of the Netherlands East Indies, a horse tram service started in 1869.
A steam tram ran from 1881, and electrification followed in 1897.
All Jakarta trams were discontinued in the 1960s by an independent Indonesia due to pressure from Sukarno, which saw tram network as "antiquated" and a "relic of [the] colonial era".
The other cities in Indonesia who used to have urban tram network were Surabaya and Semarang.
The Semarang tram network was constructed between 1882 and 1883, and it was essentially an inner suburb extension of the Samarang Joana Railway (SJS) network.
The company already had an extensive rural tram network to the east of Semarang.
Due to financial difficulties that hampered the SJS railway company, the Semarang tram network was closed down in 1940 (despite public protest in Semarang) and their rolling stock transferred to the Surabaya tram network.
Surabaya's tram network was first built in 1886.
Initially consisting of steam trams only, later electric trams were added in 1923.
They served Surabaya commuters well into the independence era.
The electric tram bowed out from service in 1968, while its steam counterpart outlived the electrics, becoming the world's last urban steam tram service before its closure in 1978.
In 2012, there was talk of reviving Surabaya's tram network as a part of Surabaya Mass Rapid Transit project, which will see parts of the old electric tram right of way reactivated, and it will be combined with the future monorail network.
The project is aimed to alleviate Surabaya's traffic congestion and provide cheap public transportation for Surabaya commuters.
In 2014, the project entered the tender phase.
In many European cities, much tramway infrastructure was lost in the mid-20th century, though not always on the same scale as in other parts of the world such as North America.
Most of Central and Eastern Europe retained the majority of its tramway systems and it is here that the largest and busiest tram systems in the world are found.
Germany and France have the most tram systems, with over 50 and over 30 networks.
Urban public transportation has been experiencing a sustained revival since the 1990s.
Many European cities are rehabilitating, upgrading, expanding and reconstructing their old tramway lines and building new tramway lines.
In 2014, the Aubagne tramway in Southern France became the first tram system in the world not to charge fares.
In the UK, most of the old Victorian era tramways were decommissioned from the 1950s-70s and replaced by buses.
The exceptions were Blackpool Tramway, opened in 1885 and one of the few tramways to still use double decker trams in the 21st century, and Great Orme Tramway which has operated at Llandudno since 1902.
Many decommissioned trams have preserved at transport museums and heritage railways.
The first of these was Seaton Tramway, which opened at its current site in 1971 but dates back to 1949.
Other notable preserved tramways include Crich Tramway (opened 1963), East Anglia Transport Museum (opened 1965), Heaton Tramway (opened 1979), Telford steam tram (opened 1980), and Wirral Tramway (opened 1995).
Additionally, Beamish Museum has reconstructed a turn of the century tramway using original rails and preserved tramcars.
In North America, these vehicles are called "streetcars" (or "trolleys" in parts of the United States); the term tram is more likely to be understood as an aerial tramway or a people-mover, though "tram" may be used colloquially in Canada.
Streetcar systems were developed in late 19th to early 20th centuries in a number of cities throughout North America.
However, most North American cities saw their streetcar lines removed in the mid-20th century for a variety of financial, technological and social reasons.
Exceptions included Boston, Cleveland, Mexico City, New Orleans, Newark, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Toronto.
Toronto currently operates the largest streetcar system in the Americas in terms of track length and ridership.
Operated by the Toronto Transit Commission, the system consists of both street-running and grade-separated tramways.
The streetcar system was established in 1861, and used a variety of vehicles in its history, including horse-drawn streetcars, Peter Witt streetcars, the PCC streetcar, and the Canadian Light Rail Vehicle and its articulated counterpart, the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle.
Since 29 December 2019, the system exclusively uses the Flexity Outlook made by Bombardier Transportation.
Streetcars once existed in the Canadian cities of Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Hamilton, Kingston, Kitchener, London, Montreal, Ottawa, Peterborough, Quebec City, Regina, Saskatoon, Windsor, Winnipeg, St. John's and Vancouver.
However, Canadian cities excluding Toronto, removed their streetcar systems in the mid-20th century.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, light rail systems were introduced in Calgary and Edmonton; with another light rail system established in Ottawa in 2001.
There is now something of a renaissance for light railways in mid-sized cities with Waterloo, Ontario the first to come on line and construction underway in Mississauga, Ontario and Hamilton, Ontario.
In the late 20th century, several Canadian locales restored portions of their defunct streetcar lines, operating them as a heritage feature for tourists.
Heritage streetcar lines in Canada include the High Level Bridge Streetcar in Edmonton, the Nelson Electric Tramway in Nelson, and the Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley in Whitehorse.
Pittsburgh had kept most of its streetcar system serving the city and many suburbs, making it the longest-lasting large-network streetcar system in the United States.
However, most of the city's streetcar lines had been abandoned by the early 1970s, and the handful of surviving streetcar lines were converted to light rail in the 1980s.
San Francisco's Muni Metro system is the largest surviving streetcar system in the United States, and has even revived previously closed streetcar lines such as the F Market & Wharves heritage streetcar line.
In the late 20th century, several cities installed modern light rail systems, in part along the same corridors as their old streetcars systems, the first of these being the San Diego Trolley in San Diego in 1981.
In the 1980s, some cities in the United States brought back streetcars lines, including Memphis, Tampa, and Little Rock; However, these streetcar systems were designed as heritage streetcar lines, and used vintage or replica-vintage vehicles.
The first "second-generation streetcar systems" in North America was opened in Portland in 2001.
The "second-generation streetcar system", utilizes modern vehicles – vehicles that feature low-floor streetcars.
These newer streetcar systems were built in several American cities in the early 21st century including Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Dallas, Detroit, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Oklahoma City, Seattle, Tucson, and Washington, D.C.
Historically, there have been trams in the following Australian cities and towns:
Adelaide, Ballarat, Bendigo, Brisbane, Broken Hill, Derby, Fremantle, Gawler, Geelong, Hobart, Kalgoorlie, Launceston, Leonora, Maitland, Melbourne, Moonta–Wallaroo, Newcastle, Perth, Rockhampton, Sorrento, Sydney and Victor Harbor.
They ranged from extensive systems to single lines.
Virtually all known types of motive power have been utilised in Australia at some stage.
The Sydney system, which closed in 1961, was the most extensive and the largest passenger carrier of any Australian public transport system then or since, moving over 400 million passengers per annum, at its peak.
In 1997, Sydney reintroduced tram services on a modern light rail network; the 2010s saw a significant expansion of the network.
Trams were retained in Melbourne (by length, the world's largest system) and, to a lesser extent, Adelaide.
All other cities had largely dismantled their networks by the 1970s.
Ballarat and Bendigo have retained some trams as heritage vehicles operating on limited trackage.
In 2008 and 2009, Bendigo trialled using its heritage trams for regular public transport, but the service was too infrequent to be useful for that.
Portland, Victoria, introduced a tourist tram line in 1996, which uses two replicas of a Melbourne cable tram grip car or dummy, driven by a concealed diesel motor, and two restored trailer cars.
A completely new tram system opened on the Gold Coast on 20 July 2014, with a major extension completed in December 2017.
The new system is known as the G:link and is the first tram/light rail system in the state of Queensland since Brisbane closed its tram network in 1969.
The construction of light rail in Canberra became the major issue of the 2016 ACT election, with the governing coalition supporting the project and the opposition against it.
The government was returned and Stage 1 of the light rail launched in April 2019.
The railway into the centre of Newcastle was truncated at Wickham on 25 December 2014, and the railway line was replaced by the Newcastle Light Rail line in February 2019.
There are also tentative plans for new tram systems in Hobart and on the Sunshine Coast.
New Zealand's tram gauges were not standardised; the 15 systems used no less than five gauges, making swapping of rolling stock from system to system difficult.
Buenos Aires in Argentina once had one of the most extensive tramway networks in the world with over 857 km (533 mi) of track, most of it dismantled during the 1960s in favour of bus transportation.
A new line, the PreMetro line E2 system feeding the Line E of the Buenos Aires Underground has been operating since 1987 on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.
In Cuenca, Ecuador, a tram line started operating since March 2019 as the main public transportation system in the city.
The L1 of the Cuenca tram is 20.4 km (12.7 mi) long with 20 stops and uses Alstom Citadis (302) trains.
A historic tram line known as the Santa Teresa Tram operates in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
In 2016, a new tram line started operating in Rio de Janeiro, known as the Light rail transportation system.
The Tranvía del Este in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires, operated from 2007 to 2012, and it is now dismantled.
Also in the city of Mendoza, in Argentina, a new tramway system is currently on service since 2012, the Metrotranvía of Mendoza, which will have a route of 12.5 km (7.8 mi) and will link five districts of the Greater Mendoza conurbation.
In Medellín, Colombia, a tram line began operation on 15 October 2015, as a revival of old Ayacucho tram.
In January 1864, well-known Anglo-Australian musician and composer Isaac Nathan was hit and killed by a Sydney horse tram when his clothing was caught in the door, whilst he was attempting to alight.
Nathan is reputed to be one of the first tram fatalities in the Southern Hemisphere (many sources claim that it was the first such accident).
On the morning of 18 August 1901, four masked men, described as "urban bushrangers", held up an eastbound horse tram in Riversdale Road, Melbourne, just past Power Street.
For their trouble the men received £2 10/- in fares from driver Thomas Taylor, and £21 19/- from eight passengers.
One passenger was injured.
The bandits were never caught.
Contemporary newspapers hypothesised that the bandits were after a specific commuter who travelled regularly on this particular tram and who was in the habit of carrying large amounts of cash.
In the Tottenham Outrage in 1909, two armed robbers hijacked a tram and were chased by the police in another tram.
On 7 June 1926 Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí was knocked down by a Barcelona tram and subsequently died.
It is reputed that in the 1930s a murdered body was dragged out of the River Thames in London.
The body had been stripped of anything that might have identified him.
The only clue to the person's identity was a portion of a tram ticket hidden in the lining of his coat.
The local police did not recognise the ticket but images in newspapers led to it being identified as a Melbourne tram ticket.
Serendipitously, the serial number on the ticket was intact.
Victoria Police in Melbourne, acting as agents for the Metropolitan Police in London, contacted the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board.
From the serial number, the M&MTB were able to tell which tram depot had issued the ticket, on what day and on which specific tram, and in which section of a particular route (North Balwyn).
Police then interviewed regular commuters and discovered the identity of a man whom, they believed, had recently travelled to London.
This led to the arrest and conviction of the murderer.
Decades after the event, the M&MTB were still citing the incident in training courses as a reason for tram conductors, etc., to keep proper and efficient records.
Model trams are popular in HO scale (1:87) and O scale (1:48 in the US and generally 1:43,5 and 1:45 in Europe and Asia).
They are typically powered and will accept plastic figures inside.
Common manufacturers are Roco and Lima, with many custom models being made as well.
The German firm Hödl and the Austrian Halling specialise in 1:87 scale.
In the US, Bachmann Industries is a mass supplier of HO streetcars and kits.
Bowser Manufacturing has produced white metal models for over 50 years.
There are many boutique vendors offering limited run epoxy and wood models.
At the high end are highly detailed brass models which are usually imported from Japan or Korea and can cost in excess of $500.
Many of these run on 16.5 mm (0.65 in) gauge track, which is correct for the representation of 4 ft 8+1⁄2 in (1,435 mm) (standard gauge) in HO scale as in US and Japan, but incorrect in 4 mm (1:76.2) scale, as it represents 4 ft 8+1⁄2 in (1,435 mm).
This scale/gauge hybrid is called OO scale.
O scale trams are also very popular among tram modellers because the increased size allows for more detail and easier crafting of overhead wiring.
In the US these models are usually purchased in epoxy or wood kits and some as brass models.
The Saint Petersburg Tram Company produces highly detailed polyurethane non-powered O Scale models from around the world which can easily be powered by trucks from vendors like Q-Car.
In the US, one of the best resources for model tram enthusiasts is the East Penn Traction Club of Philadelphia and Trolleyville a website of the Southern California Traction Club.
It is thought that the first example of a working model tramcar in the UK built by an amateur for fun was in 1929, when Frank E. Wilson created a replica of London County Council Tramways E class car 444 in 1:16 scale, which he demonstrated at an early Model Engineer Exhibition.
Another of his models was London E/1 1800, which was the only tramway exhibit in the Faraday Memorial Exhibition of 1931.
Together with likeminded friends, Frank Wilson went on to found the Tramway & Light Railway Society in 1938, establishing tramway modelling as a hobby.
The English terms tram and tramway are derived from the Scots word tram, referring respectively to a type of truck (goods wagon or freight railroad car) used in coal mines and the tracks on which they ran.
The word tram probably derived from Middle Flemish trame ("beam, handle of a barrow, bar, rung").
The identical word trame with the meaning "crossbeam" is also used in the French language.
Etymologists believe that the word tram refers to the wooden beams the railway tracks were initially made of before the railroad pioneers switched to the much more wear-resistant tracks made of iron and, later, steel.
The word Tram-car is attested from 1873.
Although the terms tram and tramway have been adopted by many languages, they are not used universally in English; North Americans prefer streetcar, trolley, or trolleycar.
The term streetcar is first recorded in 1840, and originally referred to horsecars.
The terms streetcar and trolley are often used interchangeably in the United States, with trolley being the preferred term in the eastern US and streetcar in the western US.
Streetcar is preferred in English Canada, while tramway is preferred in Quebec.
In parts of the United States, internally powered buses made to resemble a streetcar are often referred to as "trolleys".
To avoid further confusion with trolley buses, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) refers to them as "trolley-replica buses".
In the United States, the term tram has sometimes been used for rubber-tired trackless trains, which are unrelated to other kinds of trams.
A widely held belief holds the word trolley to derive from the troller (said to derive from the words traveler and roller), a four-wheeled device that was dragged along dual overhead wires by a cable that connected the troller to the top of the car and collected electrical power from the overhead wires; this portmanteau derivation is, however, most likely folk etymology.
"Trolley" and variants refer to the verb troll, meaning "roll" and probably derived from Old French, and cognate uses of the word were well established for handcarts and horse drayage, as well as for nautical uses.
The alternative North American term 'trolley' may strictly speaking be considered incorrect, as the term can also be applied to cable cars, or conduit cars that instead draw power from an underground supply.
Conventional diesel tourist buses decorated to look like streetcars are sometimes called trolleys in the US (tourist trolley).
Furthering confusion, the term tram has instead been applied to open-sided, low-speed segmented vehicles on rubber tires generally used to ferry tourists short distances, for example on the Universal Studios backlot tour and, in many countries, as tourist transport to major destinations.
The term may also apply to an aerial ropeway, e.g. the Roosevelt Island Tramway.
The New South Wales government in Australia has decided to use the term "light rail" for their trams.
Although the use of the term trolley for tram was not adopted in Europe, the term was later associated with the trolleybus, a rubber-tired vehicle running on hard pavement, which draws its power from pairs of overhead wires.
These electric buses, which use twin trolley poles, are also called trackless trolleys (particularly in the northeastern US), or sometimes simply trolleys (in the UK, as well as the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle, and Vancouver).
A trolleybus (also known as trolley bus, trolley coach, trackless trolley, trackless tram – in the 1910s and 1920s – or trolley) is an electric bus that draws power from dual overhead wires (generally suspended from roadside posts) using spring-loaded trolley poles.
Two wires, and two trolley poles, are required to complete the electrical circuit.
This differs from a tram or streetcar, which normally uses the track as the return path, needing only one wire and one pole (or pantograph).
They are also distinct from other kinds of electric buses, which usually rely on batteries.
Power is most commonly supplied as 600-volt direct current, but there are exceptions.
Currently, around 300 trolleybus systems are in operation, in cities and towns in 43 countries.
Altogether, more than 800 trolleybus systems have existed, but not more than about 400 concurrently.
The trolleybus dates back to 29 April 1882, when Dr. Ernst Werner Siemens demonstrated his "Elektromote" in a Berlin suburb.
This experiment continued until 13 June 1882, after which there were few developments in Europe, although separate experiments were conducted in the United States.
In 1899, another vehicle which could run either on or off rails was demonstrated in Berlin.
The next development was when Louis Lombard-Gérin operated an experimental line at the Paris Exhibition of 1900 after four years of trials, with a circular route around Lake Daumesnil that carried passengers.
Routes followed in six places including Eberswalde and Fontainebleau.
Max Schiemann on 10 July 1901 opened the world's fourth passenger-carrying trolleybus system, which operated at Bielatal (Biela Valley, near Dresden), Germany.
Schiemann built and operated the Bielatal system, and is credited with developing the under-running trolley current collection system, with two horizontally parallel overhead wires and rigid trolleypoles spring-loaded to hold them up to the wires.
Although this system operated only until 1904, Schiemann had developed what is now the standard trolleybus current collection system.
In the early days there were many other methods of current collection.
The Cédès-Stoll (Mercédès-Électrique-Stoll) system was first operated near Dresden between 1902 and 1904, and 18 systems followed.
The Lloyd-Köhler or Bremen system was tried out in Bremen with 5 further installations, and the Cantono Frigerio system was used in Italy.
Throughout this period, trackless freight systems and electric canal boats were also built.
Leeds and Bradford became the first cities to put trolleybuses into service in Great Britain, on 20 June 1911.
Supposedly, though it was opened on 20 June, the public was not admitted to the Bradford route until the 24th.
Bradford was also the last city to operate trolleybuses in the UK; the system closed on 26 March 1972.
The last rear-entrance trolleybus in service in Britain was also in Bradford and is now owned by the Bradford Trolleybus Association.
Birmingham was the first UK city to replace a tram route with trolleybuses, while Wolverhampton, under the direction of Charles Owen Silvers, became world-famous for its trolleybus designs.
There were 50 trolleybus systems in the UK, London's being the largest.
By the time trolleybuses arrived in Britain in 1911, the Schiemann system was well established and was the most common, although the Cédès-Stoll (Mercédès-Électrique-Stoll) system was tried in West Ham (in 1912) and in Keighley (in 1913).
Smaller trackless trolley systems were built in the US early as well.
The first non-experimental system was a seasonal municipal line installed near Nantasket Beach in 1904; the first year-round commercial line was built to open a hilly property to development just outside Los Angeles in 1910.
The trackless trolley was often seen as an interim step, leading to streetcars.
In the US, some systems subscribed to the all-four concept of using buses, trolleybuses, streetcars (trams, trolleys), and rapid transit subway and/or elevated lines (metros), as appropriate, for routes ranging from the lightly used to the heaviest trunk line.
Buses and trolleybuses in particular were seen as entry systems that could later be upgraded to rail as appropriate.
In a similar fashion, many cities in Britain originally viewed trolleybus routes as extensions to tram (streetcar) routes where the cost of constructing or restoring track could not be justified at the time, though this attitude changed markedly (to viewing them as outright replacements for tram routes) in the years after 1918.
Trackless trolleys were the dominant form of new post-World War I electric traction, with extensive systems in among others, Los Angeles, Chicago, Rhode Island, and Atlanta; Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia still maintain an "all-four" fleet.
Some trolleybus lines in the United States (and in Britain, as noted above) came into existence when a trolley or tram route did not have sufficient ridership to warrant track maintenance or reconstruction.
In a similar manner, a proposed tram scheme in Leeds, United Kingdom, was changed to a trolleybus scheme to cut costs.
Trolleybuses are uncommon today in North America, but their use is widespread in Europe and Russia.
They remain common in many countries which were part of the Soviet Union.
Generally trolleybuses occupy a position in usage between street railways (trams) and motorbuses.
Worldwide, around 300 cities or metropolitan areas on 5 continents are served by trolleybuses (further detail under Use and preservation, below).
This mode of transport operates in large cities, such as Belgrade, Lyon, Pyongyang, São Paulo, Seattle, Sofia, St. Petersburg, and Zurich, as well as in smaller ones such as Dayton, Gdynia, Lausanne, Limoges, Modena, and Salzburg.
As of 2020, Kyiv has, due to its history in the former Soviet Union, the largest trolleybus system in the world in terms of route length while another formerly Soviet city, Minsk, has the largest system in terms of number of routes (which also date back to the Soviet era).
Landskrona has the smallest system in terms of route length, while Mariánské Lázně is the smallest city to be served by trolleybuses.
Opened in 1914, Shanghai's trolleybus system is the oldest operating system in the world.
With a length of 86 km, route #52 of Crimean Trolleybus is the longest trolleybus line in the world.
See also Trolleybus usage by country.
Transit authorities in some cities have reduced or discontinued the use of trolleybuses in recent years, while others, wanting to add or expand use of zero-emission vehicles in an urban environment, have opened new systems or are planning new systems.
For example, new systems opened in Lecce, Italy, in 2012; in Malatya, Turkey, in 2015; and in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2017.
Beijing and Shanghai have been expanding their respective systems, with Beijing expanding to a 31-line system operated with a fleet of over 1,250 trolleybuses.
Trolleybuses have been long encouraged in North Korea with the newest city to have a network being Manpo in December 2019.
Since the year 2022, the city of Prague is constructing a new trolleybus system.
Meanwhile, in 2023, plans for a trolleybus line in Berlin were scrapped in favour of a solution with battery-powered vehicles.
Cheaper infrastructure – The initial start up cost of trams is much higher, due to rail, signals, and other infrastructure.
Trolleybuses can pull over to the kerb like other buses, eliminating the need for special boarding stations or boarding islands in the middle of the street, thus stations can be moved as needed.
Better hill climbing – Trolleybuses' rubber tyres have better adhesion than trams' steel wheels on steel rails, giving them better hill-climbing capability and braking.
Easier traffic avoidance – Unlike trams (where side tracks are often unavailable), an out-of-service vehicle can be moved to the side of the road and its trolley poles lowered.
The ability to drive a substantial distance from the power wires allows trackless vehicles to avoid obstacles, although it also means a possibility that the vehicle may steer or skid far enough that the trolley pole can no longer reach the wire, stranding the vehicle.
Trackless trolleys also are able to avoid collisions by manoeuvring around obstacles, similar to motor buses and other road vehicles, while trams can only change speed.
Quietness – Trolleybuses are generally quieter than trams.
Easier training – The control of trolleybuses is relatively similar to motorbuses; the potential operator pool for all buses is much larger than for trams.
Note: As there are numerous variations of tram and light-rail technology, the disadvantages listed may be applicable only with a specific technology or design.
Like any bus, much less capacity than trams.
More control required – Trolleybuses must be driven like motorbuses, requiring directional control by the driver.
Higher rolling resistance – Rubber-tired vehicles generally have more rolling resistance than steel wheels, which decreases energy efficiency.
Less efficient use of right-of-way – Lanes must be wider for unguided buses than for streetcars, since unguided buses can drift side-to-side.
The use of guidance rail allows trams running in parallel lanes to pass closer together than drivers could safely steer.
Difficulties with platform loading – Implementation of level platform loading with minimal gap, either at design stage or afterwards, is easier and cheaper to implement with rail vehicles.
Difficult to re-route – When compared to motorbuses, trolleybuses have greater difficulties with temporary or permanent re-routings, wiring for which is not usually readily available outside of downtown areas where the buses may be re-routed via adjacent business area streets where other trolleybus routes operate.
This problem was highlighted in Vancouver in July 2008, when an explosion closed several roads in the city's downtown core.
Because of the closure, trolleys were forced to detour several miles off their route in order to stay on the wires, leaving major portions of their routes not in service and off-schedule.
Aesthetics – The jumble of overhead wires may be seen as unsightly.
Intersections often have a "webbed ceiling" appearance, due to multiple crossing and converging sets of trolley wires.
Dewirements – Trolley poles sometimes come off the wire.
Dewirements are relatively rare in modern systems with well-maintained overhead wires, hangers, fittings and contact shoes.
Trolleybuses are equipped with special insulated pole ropes which drivers use to reconnect the trolley poles with the overhead wires.
When approaching switches, trolleybuses usually must decelerate in order to avoid dewiring, and this deceleration can potentially add slightly to traffic congestion.
In 1998, a dewirement in Shenyang on poorly maintained infrastructure killed 5 people and ultimately led to the destruction of the trolleybus network.
Unable to overtake other trolleybuses – Trolleybuses cannot overtake one another in regular service unless two separate sets of wires with a switch are provided or the vehicles are equipped with off-wire capability, with the latter an increasingly common feature of new trolleybuses.
Higher capital cost of equipment – Trolleybuses are often long-lived equipment, with limited market demand.
This generally leads to higher prices relative to internal combustion buses.
The long equipment life may also complicate upgrades.
More training required – Drivers must learn how to prevent dewiring, slowing down at turns and through switches in the overhead wire system, for example.
Overhead wires create obstruction – Trolleybus systems employ overhead wires above the roads, often shared with other vehicles.
The wires can restrict tall motor vehicles such as delivery trucks ("lorries") and double decker buses from using or crossing roads fitted with overhead wires, as such vehicles would hit the wires or pass dangerously close to them, risking damage and dangerous electrical faults.
The wires also may impede positioning of overhead signage and create a hazard to activities such as road repairs using tall excavators or piling rigs, use of scaffolding, etc.
With the re-introduction of hybrid designs, trolleybuses are no longer tied to overhead wires.
The Public Service Company of New Jersey, with Yellow Coach, developed "All Service Vehicles"; trackless trolleys capable of operating as gas-electric buses when off wire, and used them successfully between 1935 and 1948.
Since the 1980s, systems such as Muni in San Francisco, TransLink in Vancouver, and Beijing, among others, have bought trolleybuses equipped with batteries to allow them to operate fairly long distances away from the wires.
Supercapacitors can be also used to move buses short distances.
Trolleybuses can optionally be equipped either with limited off-wire capability—a small diesel engine or battery pack—for auxiliary or emergency use only, or full dual-mode capability.
A simple auxiliary power unit can allow a trolleybus to get around a route blockage or can reduce the amount (or complexity) of overhead wiring needed at operating garages (depots).
This capability has become increasingly common in newer trolleybuses, particularly in China, North America and Europe, where the vast majority of new trolleybuses delivered since the 1990s are fitted with at least limited off-wire capability.
These have gradually replaced older trolleybuses which lacked such capability.
In Philadelphia, new trackless trolleys equipped with small hybrid diesel-electric power units for operating short distances off-wire were placed in service by SEPTA in 2008.
This is instead of the trolleys using a conventional diesel drive train or battery-only system for their off-wire movement.
King County Metro in Seattle, Washington and the MBTA in Boston's Silver Line have used dual-mode buses that run on electric power from overhead wires on a fixed right-of-way and on diesel power on city streets.
Metro used special-order articulated Breda buses, introduced in 1990, and most were retired in 2005.
A limited number of the Breda dual-mode buses had their diesel engines removed, and operated exclusively as trolleybuses until 2016.
Since 2004, the MBTA has used dual-mode buses on its Silver Line (Waterfront) route.
The last of these were be replaced by diesel hybrid and battery-electric buses in June 2023.
With the development of battery technology in recent years, trolleybuses with extended off-wire capability through on-board batteries are becoming popular.
The on-board battery is charged while the vehicle is in motion under the overhead wires and then allows off-wire travel for significant distances, often in excess of 15 km.
Such trolleybuses are called, among others, trolleybuses with In-Motion Charging, hybrid trolleybuses, battery trolleybuses and electric buses with dynamic charging.
The main advantages of this technology over conventional battery electric buses are reduced cost and weight of the battery due to its smaller size, no delays for charging at end stops as the vehicle charges while in motion and reduced need for dedicated charging stations that take up public space.
This new development allows the extension of trolleybus routes or the electrification of bus routes without the need to build overhead wires along the whole length of the route.
Cities that utilize such trolleybuses include Beijing, Ostrava, Shanghai, Mexico City, Saint Petersburg, and Bergen.
The new trolleybus systems in Marrakesh, Baoding and Prague are based exclusively on battery trolleybuses.
In 2020, the city of Berlin, Germany announced plans to build a new trolleybus system with 15 routes and 190 battery trolleybuses.
However, in early 2023 it was announced that the planned lines would use battery powered electric buses instead.
With increasing diesel fuel costs and problems caused by particulate matter and NOx emissions in cities, trolleybuses can be an attractive alternative, either as the primary transit mode or as a supplement to rapid transit and commuter rail networks.
Trolleybuses are quieter than internal combustion engine vehicles.
Mainly a benefit, it also provides much less warning of a trolleybus's approach.
A speaker attached to the front of the vehicle can raise the noise to a desired "safe" level.
This noise can be directed to pedestrians in front of the vehicle, as opposed to motor noise which typically comes from the rear of a bus and is more noticeable to bystanders than to pedestrians.
Trolleybuses can share overhead wires and other electrical infrastructure (such as substations) with tramways.
This can result in cost savings when trolleybuses are added to a transport system that already has trams, though this refers only to potential savings over the cost of installing and operating trolleybuses alone.
The wires are attached to poles next to the street and carefully stretched and mounted so that they are the same width apart and same height over the road (usually about 18 to 20 feet (~5.7m)).
The pair of wires is insulated from the poles and provides about 500 to 600 volts to the bus below.
Trolleybus wire switches (called "frogs" in the UK) are used where a trolleybus line branches into two or where two lines join.
A switch may be either in a "straight through" or "turnout" position; it normally remains in the "straight through" position unless it has been triggered, and reverts to it after a few seconds or after the pole shoe passes through and strikes a release lever (in Boston, the resting or "default" position is the "leftmost" position).
Triggering is typically accomplished by a pair of contacts, one on each wire close to and before the switch assembly, which power a pair of electromagnets, one in each frog with diverging wires ("frog" generally refers to one fitting that guides one trolley wheel/shoe onto a desired wire or across one wire.
Occasionally, "frog" has been used to refer to the entire switch assembly).
Multiple branches may be handled by installing more than one switch assembly.
For example, to provide straight-through, left-turn or right-turn branches at an intersection, one switch is installed some distance from the intersection to choose the wires over the left-turn lane, and another switch is mounted closer to or in the intersection to choose between straight through and a right turn (this would be the arrangement in countries such as the United States, where traffic directionality is right-handed; in left-handed traffic countries such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the first switch (before the intersection) would be used to access the right-turn lanes, and the second switch (usually in the intersection) would be for the left-turn).
Three common types of switches exist: power-on/power-off (the picture of a switch above is of this type), Selectric, and Fahslabend.
A power-on/power-off switch is triggered if the trolleybus is drawing considerable power from the overhead wires, usually by accelerating, at the moment the poles pass over the contacts (the contacts are lined up on the wires in this case).
If the trolleybus "coasts" through the switch, the switch will not activate.
Some trolleybuses, such as those in Philadelphia and Vancouver, have a manual "power-coast" toggle switch that turns the power on or off.
This allows a switch to be triggered in situations that would otherwise be impossible, such as activating a switch while braking or accelerating through a switch without activating it.
One variation of the toggle switch will simulate accelerating by causing a larger power draw (through a resistance grid), but will not simulate coasting and prevent activation of the switch by cutting the power.
A Selectric switch has a similar design, but the contacts on the wires are skewed, often at a 45-degree angle, rather than being lined up.
This skew means that a trolleybus going straight through will not trigger the switch, but a trolleybus making a turn will have its poles match the contacts in a matching skew (with one pole shoe ahead of the other), which will trigger the switch regardless of power draw (accelerating versus coasting).
For a Fahslabend switch, the trolleybus' turn indicator control (or a separate driver-controlled switch) causes a coded radio signal to be sent from a transmitter, often attached to a trolley pole.
The receiver is attached to the switch and causes it to trigger if the correct code is received.
This has the advantage that the driver does not need to be accelerating the bus (as with a power-on/power-off switch) or trying to make a sharp turn (as with a Selectric switch).
Trailing switches (where two sets of wires merge) do not require action by the operator.
The frog runners are pushed into the desired position by the trolley shoe, or the frog is shaped so the shoe is guided onto the exit wire without any moving parts.
Well over 200 different trolleybus makers have existed – mostly commercial manufacturers, but in some cases (particularly in communist countries), built by the publicly owned operating companies or authorities.
91–125  Of the defunct or former trolleybus manufacturers, the largest producers in North America and Western Europe – ones whose production totalled more than 1,000 units each – included the U.S. companies Brill (approx.
3,250 total), Pullman-Standard (2,007), and Marmon-Herrington (1,624); the English companies AEC (approx. 1,750), British United Traction (BUT) (1,573), Leyland (1,420) and Sunbeam (1,379); France's Vétra (more than 1,750); and the Italian builders Alfa Romeo (2,044) and Fiat (approx. 1,700).
The largest former trolleybus manufacture is Trolza (formerly Uritsky, or ZiU) since 1951, until they declared their bankruptcy in 2017, building over 65000 trolleybuses.
Also, Canadian Car and Foundry built 1,114 trolleybuses based on designs by Brill.
A significant change to trolleybus designs starting in the early 1990s was the introduction of low-floor models, which began only a few years after the first such models were introduced for motorbuses.
These have gradually replaced high-floor designs, and by 2012, every existing trolleybus system in Western Europe had purchased low-floor trolleybuses, with the La Spezia (Italy) system being the last one to do so, and several systems in other parts of the world have purchased low-floor vehicles.
In the United States, some transit agencies had already begun to accommodate persons in wheelchairs by purchasing buses with wheelchair lifts, and early examples of fleets of lift-equipped trolleybuses included 109 AM General trolleybuses built for the Seattle trolleybus system in 1979 and the retrofitting of lifts in 1983 to 64 Flyer E800s in the Dayton system's fleet.: 61  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required that all new transit vehicles placed into service after 1 July 1993 be accessible to such passengers.
Trolleybuses in other countries also began to introduce better access for the disabled in the 1990s, when the first two low-floor trolleybus models were introduced in Europe, both built in 1991, a "Swisstrolley" demonstrator built by Switzerland's NAW/Hess and an N6020 demonstrator built by Neoplan.
The first production-series low-floor trolleybuses were built in 1992: 13 by NAW for the Geneva system and 10 Gräf & Stift for the Innsbruck system.
By 1995, such vehicles were also being made by several other European manufacturers, including Skoda, Breda, Ikarus, and Van Hool.
The first Solaris "Trollino" made its debut in early 2001.
: 30  In the former Soviet Union countries, Belarus' Belkommunmash built its first low-floor trolleybus (model AKSM-333) in 1999, and other manufacturers in the former Soviet countries joined the trend in the early 2000s.
However, because the lifespan of a trolleybus is typically longer than that of a motorbus, the budget allocation and purchase typically factored in the longevity; the introduction of low-floor vehicles applied pressures on operators to retire high-floor trolleybuses that were only a few years old and replace them with low-floor trolleybuses.
Responses varied, with some systems keeping their high-floor fleets, and others retiring them early but, in many instances, selling them second-hand for continued use in countries where there was a demand for low-cost second-hand trolleybuses, in particular in Romania and Bulgaria.
The Lausanne system dealt with this dilemma in the 1990s by purchasing new low-floor passenger trailers to be towed by its high-floor trolleybuses, a choice later also made by Lucerne.
Outside Europe, 14 vehicles built by, and for, the Shanghai trolleybus system in mid-1999 were the first reported low-floor trolleybuses in Southeast Asia.
Wellington, New Zealand, took delivery of its first low-floor trolleybus in March 2003, and by the end of 2009 had renewed its entire fleet with such vehicles.
Unlike Europe, where low floor means "100%" low floor from front to back, most "low floor" buses on other continents are actually only low-entry or part-low floor.
With regard to non-passenger aspects of vehicle design, the transition from high-floor to low-floor has meant that some equipment previously placed under the floor has been moved to the roof.
Some transit operators have needed to modify their maintenance facilities to accommodate this change, a one-time expense.
Since the end of 1997, no double-decker trolleybuses have been in service anywhere in the world, but, in the past, several manufacturers made such vehicles.
Most builders of double-deck trolleybuses were in the United Kingdom, but there were a few, usually solitary, instances of such trolleybuses being built in other countries, including in Germany by Henschel (for Hamburg); in Italy, by Lancia (for Porto, Portugal); in Russia, by the Yaroslavl motor plant (for Moscow) and in Spain, by Maquitrans (for Barcelona).
British manufacturers of double-deck trolleybuses included AEC, BUT, Crossley, Guy, Leyland, Karrier, Sunbeam and others.
In 2001, Citybus (Hong Kong) converted a Dennis Dragon (#701) into a double-decker trolleybus, and it was tested on a 300-metre track in Wong Chuk Hang in that year.
Hong Kong decided not to build a trolleybus system, and the testing of this prototype did not lead to any further production of vehicles.
There are currently 300 cities or metropolitan areas where trolleybuses are operated, and more than 500 additional trolleybus systems have existed in the past.
For an overview, by country, see Trolleybus usage by country, and for complete lists of trolleybus systems by location, with dates of opening and (where applicable) closure, see List of trolleybus systems and the related lists indexed there.
Of the systems existing as of 2012, the majority are located in Europe and Asia, including 85 in Russia and 43 in Ukraine.
However, there are eight systems existing in North America and nine in South America.
Trolleybuses have been preserved in most of the countries where they have operated.
The United Kingdom has the largest number of preserved trolleybuses with more than 110, while the United States has around 70.
Most preserved vehicles are on static display only, but a few museums are equipped with a trolleybus line, allowing trolleybuses to operate for visitors.
Museums with operational trolleybus routes include three in the UK – the Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft, the East Anglia Transport Museum, and the Black Country Living Museum – and three in the United States – the Illinois Railway Museum, the Seashore Trolley Museum, and the Shore Line Trolley Museum – but operation of trolleybuses does not necessarily occur on a regular schedule of dates at these museums.
Understeer and oversteer are vehicle dynamics terms used to describe the sensitivity of the vehicle to changes in steering angle associated with changes in lateral acceleration.
This sensitivity is defined for a level road for a given steady state operating condition by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in document J670 and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in document 8855.
Whether the vehicle is understeer or oversteer depends on the rate of change of the understeer angle.
The Understeer Angle is the amount of additional steering (at the road wheels, not the hand wheel) that must be added in any given steady-state maneuver beyond the Ackermann steer angle.
The Ackermann Steer Angle is the steer angle at which the vehicle would travel about a curve when there is no lateral acceleration required (at negligibly low speed).
Car and motorsport enthusiasts often use the terminology informally in magazines and blogs to describe vehicle response to steering in a variety of manoueuvres.
Several tests can be used to determine understeer gradient: constant radius (repeat tests at different speeds), constant speed (repeat tests with different steering angles), or constant steer (repeat tests at different speeds).
Formal descriptions of these three kinds of testing are provided by ISO.
Gillespie goes into some detail on two of the measurement methods.
Results depend on the type of test, so simply giving a deg/g value is not sufficient; it is also necessary to indicate the type of procedure used to measure the gradient.
Vehicles are inherently nonlinear systems, and it is normal for U to vary over the range of testing.
It is possible for a vehicle to show understeer in some conditions and oversteer in others.
Therefore, it is necessary to specify the speed and lateral acceleration whenever reporting understeer/oversteer characteristics.
Many properties of the vehicle affect the understeer gradient, including tyre cornering stiffness, camber thrust, lateral force compliance steer, self aligning torque, lateral weight transfer, and compliance in the steering system.
Weight distribution affects the normal force on each tyre and therefore its grip.
These individual contributions can be identified analytically or by measurement in a Bundorf analysis.
Great care must be taken to avoid conflating the understeer/oversteer behavior with the limit behavior of a vehicle.
The physics are very different.
They have different handling implications and different causes.
The former is concerned with tire distortion effects due to slip and camber angles as increasing levels of lateral acceleration are attained.
The latter is concerned with the limiting friction case in which either the front or rear wheels become saturated first.
It is best to use race driver's descriptive terms "push (plow) and loose (spin)" for limit behavior so that these concepts are not confused.
Tyres transmit lateral (side to side) and longitudinal (front to back) forces to the ground.
The total traction force (grip) available to the a tyre is the vector sum of the lateral and longitudinal forces, a function of the normal force and coefficient of friction.
If the lateral and longitudinal forces presented at the tyre during operations exceeds the tyre's available traction force then the tyre is said to be saturated and will loose its grip on the ground and start to slip.
Push (plow) can be understood as a condition where, while cornering, the front tyres become saturated before the rear and slip first.
Since the front tyres cannot provide any additional lateral force and the rear tyres can, the front of the vehicle will follow a path of greater radius than the rear and if there are no changes to the steering angle (i.e. the steering wheel stays in the same position), the vehicle's front will slide to the outside of the curve.
If the rear tyres become saturated before the front, the front tyres will keep the front of the vehicle on the desired path but the rear tyres will slip and follow a path with a greater radius.
The back end will swing out and the vehicle will turn toward the inside of the curve.
If the steering angle is not changed, then the front wheels will trace out a smaller and smaller circle while the rear wheels continue to swing around the front of the car.
This is what is happening when a car 'spins out'.
A car susceptible to being loose is sometimes known as 'tail happy', as in the way a dog wags its tail when happy and a common problem is fishtailing.
In real-world driving, there are continuous changes in speed, acceleration (vehicle braking or accelerating), steering angle, etc.
Those changes are all constantly altering the load distribution of the vehicle, which, along with changes in tyre temperatures and road surface conditions are is constantly changing the maximum traction force available at each tyre.
Generally, though, it is changes to the center of mass which cause tyre saturation and inform limit handling characteristics.
If the center of mass is moved forward, the understeer gradient tends to increase due to tyre load sensitivity.
When the center of mass is moved rearward, the understeer gradient tends to decrease.
The shifting of the center of mass is proportional to acceleration and affected by the height of the center of mass.
When braking, more of the vehicles weight (load) is put on the front tyres and an less on the rear tyres.
Conversely, when the vehicle accelerates, the opposite happens, the weight shifts to the rear tires.
Similarly, as the center of mass of the load is shifted from one side to the other, the inside or outside tyres traction changes.
In extreme cases, the inside or front tyres may completely lift off the ground, eliminating or reducing the steering input that can be transferred to the ground.
While weight distribution and suspension geometry have the greatest effect on measured understeer gradient in a steady-state test, power distribution, brake bias and front-rear weight transfer will also affect which wheels lose traction first in many real-world scenarios.
When an understeer vehicle is taken to the grip limit of the tyres, where it is no longer possible to increase lateral acceleration, the vehicle will follow a path with a radius larger than intended.
Although the vehicle cannot increase lateral acceleration, it is dynamically stable.
When an oversteer vehicle is taken to the grip limit of the tyres, it becomes dynamically unstable with a tendency to spin.
Although the vehicle is unstable in open-loop control, a skilled driver can maintain control past the point of instability with countersteering and/or correct use of the throttle or even brakes; this is done purposely in the sport of drifting.
If a rear-wheel-drive vehicle has enough power to spin the rear wheels, it can initiate oversteer at any time by sending enough engine power to the wheels that they start spinning.
Once traction is broken, they are relatively free to swing laterally.
Under braking load, more work is typically done by the front brakes.
If this forward bias is too great, then the front tyres may lose traction, causing understeer.
Understeer gradient is one of the main measures for characterizing steady-state cornering behavior.
It is involved in other properties such as characteristic speed (the speed for an understeer vehicle where the steer angle needed to negotiate a turn is twice the Ackermann angle), lateral acceleration gain (g's/deg), yaw velocity gain (1/s), and critical speed (the speed where an oversteer vehicle has infinite lateral acceleration gain).
In the United States, VIN etching is a countermeasure to motor vehicle theft, that involves etching a vehicle's VIN onto its windows to reduce the value of a stolen vehicle to thieves.
The Federal Trade Commission includes VIN etching on a list of upsold services including extended warranties, service and maintenance plans, payment programs, guaranteed automobile or asset protection, emergency road service, and other theft protection devices, and warns consumers about the practice of upselling when buying a vehicle.
VIN etching uses a variety of methods, commonly a stencil and an acidic etching paste, to engrave a vehicle's vehicle identification number (VIN) onto the windshield and windows.
Most parts on a vehicle already have at least a partial VIN stamped onto them, and many auto parts buyers will not purchase parts that carry identification numbers.
Should a thief try to sell the parts from a vehicle for profit, those marked parts carry a higher risk for the thief and the auto parts seller.
Since automotive glass generally does not have identification numbers and is often interchangeable among many different years and models of vehicles, it usually yields a much greater profit for a thief compared to other components on the vehicle; because a vehicle's windows are stamped with the VIN, thieves would need to discard the glass before "parting out" the stolen vehicle, thus reducing or eliminating their profit.
VIN etching can also increase the odds of recovery of a stolen car by police.
VIN etching is recommended by police departments, insurance agencies, and government automobile/vehicle theft prevention agencies
This service is sometimes offered free of charge at sponsored events.
Vehicles with VIN-etched windows may be eligible for insurance rate reductions of as much as 15% in some US states.
Some automobile dealers try to include VIN etching as an extra service to boost their profit margin when selling a vehicle; they may even pre-print a charge for VIN etching on the bill of sale, as if to suggest that VIN etching is mandatory rather than an optional, add-on service.
Inflated dealership fees of $200 to $2,000 for VIN etching are not unheard of.
However, consumer advocates note that while some states do require that dealers offer VIN etching, no states require that consumers purchase it from the dealer.
Consumers who want to have the VIN etched on their vehicle windows but are unable to find a free etching service in their area can often save hundreds of dollars over the dealership fee by using a do-it-yourself VIN etching kit purchased from an Internet retailer or a local auto parts dealer, for as little as $20–25.
The unsprung mass (colloquially unsprung weight) of a vehicle is the mass of the suspension, wheels or tracks (as applicable), and other components directly connected to them.
This contrasts with the sprung mass (or weight) supported by the suspension, which includes the body and other components within or attached to it.
Components of the unsprung mass include the wheel axles, wheel bearings, wheel hubs, tires, and a portion of the weight of driveshafts, springs, shock absorbers, and suspension links.
Brakes that are mounted inboard (i.e. as on the drive shaft, and not part of the wheel or its hub) are part of a vehicle's sprung mass.
The unsprung mass of a typical wheel/tire combination represents a trade-off between the pair's bump-absorbing/road-tracking ability and vibration isolation.
Bumps and surface imperfections in the road cause tire compression, inducing a force on the unsprung mass.
The unsprung mass then reacts to this force with movement of its own.
The motion amplitude for small duration and amplitude bumps is inversely proportional to the weight.
A lighter wheel which readily rebounds from road bumps will have more grip and more constant grip when tracking over an imperfect road.
For this reason, lighter wheels are sought especially for high-performance applications.
However, the lighter wheel will soak up less vibration.
The irregularities of the road surface will transfer to the cabin through the suspension and hence ride quality and road noise are worse.
For longer duration bumps that the wheels follow, greater unsprung mass causes more energy to be absorbed by the wheels and makes the ride worse.
Pneumatic or elastic tires help by restoring some spring to the (otherwise) unsprung mass, but the damping possible from tire flexibility is limited by considerations of fuel economy and overheating.
The shock absorbers, if any, also damp the spring motion and must be less stiff than would optimally damp the wheel bounce.
So the wheels still vibrate after each bump before coming to rest.
On dirt roads and on some softly paved roads, the induced motion generates small bumps, known as corrugations, washboarding or "corduroy" because they resemble smaller versions of the bumps in roads made of logs.
These cause sustained wheel bounce in subsequent axles, enlarging the bumps.
High unsprung mass also exacerbates wheel control issues under hard acceleration or braking.
If the vehicle does not have adequate wheel location in the vertical plane (such as a rear-wheel drive car with Hotchkiss drive, a live axle supported by simple leaf springs), vertical forces exerted by acceleration or hard braking combined with high unsprung mass can lead to severe wheel hop, compromising traction and steering control.
A beneficial effect of unsprung mass is that high frequency road irregularities, such as the gravel in an asphalt or concrete road surface, are isolated from the body more completely because the tires and springs act as separate filter stages, with the unsprung mass tending to uncouple them.
Likewise, sound and vibration isolation is improved (at the expense of handling), in production automobiles, by the use of rubber bushings between the frame and suspension, by any flexibility in the frame or body work, and by the flexibility of the seats.
Unsprung mass is a consideration in the design of a vehicle's suspension and the materials chosen for its components.
Beam axle suspensions, in which wheels on opposite sides are connected as a rigid unit, generally have greater unsprung mass than independent suspension systems, in which the wheels are suspended and allowed to move separately.
Heavy components such as the differential can be made part of the sprung mass by connecting them directly to the body (as in a de Dion tube rear suspension).
Lightweight materials, such as aluminum, plastic, carbon fiber, and/or hollow components can provide further weight reductions at the expense of greater cost and/or fragility.
The term 'unsprung mass' was coined by the mathematician Albert Healey of the Dunlop tyre company.
He presented one of the first lectures taking a rigid analytical approach to suspension design, 'The Tyre as a part of the Suspension System'  to the Institution of Automobile Engineers in November 1924.
This lecture was published as a 100-page paper.
Inboard brakes can significantly reduce unsprung mass, but put more load on half axles and (constant velocity) universal joints, and require space that may not be easily accommodated.
If located next to a differential or transaxle, waste heat from the brakes may overheat the differential or vice versa, particularly in hard use, such as racing.
They also make anti-dive suspension characteristics harder to achieve because the moment created by braking does not act on the suspension arms.
The Chapman strut used the driveshafts as suspension arms, thus requiring only the weight of one component rather than two.
Jaguar's patented independent rear suspension (IRS) similarly reduced unsprung mass by replacing the upper wishbone arms of the suspension with the drive shafts, as well as mounting the brakes inboard in some versions.
Scooter-type motorcycles use an integrated engine-gearbox-final drive system that pivots as part of the rear suspension and hence is partly unsprung.
This arrangement is linked to the use of quite small wheels, further affecting their poor reputation for road-holding.
A universal joint (also called a universal coupling or U-joint) is a joint or coupling connecting rigid shafts whose axes are inclined to each other.
It is commonly used in shafts that transmit rotary motion.
It consists of a pair of hinges located close together, oriented at 90° to each other, connected by a cross shaft.
The universal joint is not a constant-velocity joint.
The main concept of the universal joint is based on the design of gimbals, which have been in use since antiquity.
One anticipation of the universal joint was its use by the ancient Greeks on ballistae.
In Europe the universal joint is often called the Cardano joint (and a drive shaft that uses the joints, a Cardan shaft), after the 16th century Italian mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, who was an early writer on gimbals, although his writings mentioned only gimbal mountings, not universal joints.
The mechanism was later described in Technica curiosa sive mirabilia artis (1664) by Gaspar Schott, who mistakenly claimed that it was a constant-velocity joint.
Shortly afterward, between 1667 and 1675, Robert Hooke analysed the joint and found that its speed of rotation was nonuniform, but that property could be used to track the motion of the shadow on the face of a sundial.
In fact, the component of the equation of time which accounts for the tilt of the equatorial plane relative to the ecliptic is entirely analogous to the mathematical description of the universal joint.
The first recorded use of the term universal joint for this device was by Hooke in 1676, in his book Helioscopes.
He published a description in 1678, resulting in the use of the term Hooke's joint in the English-speaking world.
In 1683, Hooke proposed a solution to the nonuniform rotary speed of the universal joint: a pair of Hooke's joints 90° out of phase at either end of an intermediate shaft, an arrangement that is now known as a type of constant-velocity joint.
Christopher Polhem of Sweden later re-invented the universal joint, giving rise to the name Polhemsknut ("Polhem knot") in Swedish.
In 1841, the English scientist Robert Willis analyzed the motion of the universal joint.
By 1845, the French engineer and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet had analyzed the movement of the universal joint using spherical trigonometry.
The term universal joint was used in the 18th century and was in common use in the 19th century.
Edmund Morewood's 1844 patent for a metal coating machine called for a universal joint, by that name, to accommodate small alignment errors between the engine and rolling mill shafts.
Ephriam Shay's locomotive patent of 1881, for example, used double universal joints in the locomotive's drive shaft.
Charles Amidon used a much smaller universal joint in his bit-brace patented 1884.
Beauchamp Tower's spherical, rotary, high speed steam engine used an adaptation of the universal joint c. 1885.
The term Cardan joint appears to be a latecomer to the English language.
Many early uses in the 19th century appear in translations from French or are strongly influenced by French usage.
Examples include an 1868 report on the Exposition Universelle of 1867 and an article on the dynamometer translated from French in 1881.
In the 20th century, Clarence W. Spicer and the Spicer Manufacturing Company, as well as the Hardy Spicer successor brand, helped further popularize universal joints in the automotive, farm equipment, heavy equipment, and industrial machinery industries.
the bend angle of the joint, or angle of the axles with respect to each other, with zero being parallel or straight through.
with respect to its beginning position along the y axis.
A configuration known as a double Cardan joint drive shaft partially overcomes the problem of jerky rotation.
This configuration uses two U-joints joined by an intermediate shaft, with the second U-joint phased in relation to the first U-joint to cancel the changing angular velocity.
In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven shaft will match that of the driving shaft, provided that both the driving shaft and the driven shaft are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate shaft (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase.
This assembly is commonly employed in rear wheel drive vehicles, where it is known as a drive shaft or propeller (prop) shaft.
Even when the driving and driven shafts are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate shaft, if these angles are greater than zero, oscillating moments are applied to the three shafts as they rotate.
These tend to bend them in a direction perpendicular to the common plane of the shafts.
This applies forces to the support bearings and can cause "launch shudder" in rear wheel drive vehicles.
The intermediate shaft will also have a sinusoidal component to its angular velocity, which contributes to vibration and stresses.
and it is seen that the output drive is just 90 degrees out of phase with the input shaft, yielding a constant-velocity drive.
A double Cardan joint consists of two universal joints mounted back to back with a centre yoke; the centre yoke replaces the intermediate shaft.
Provided that the angle between the input shaft and centre yoke is equal to the angle between the centre yoke and the output shaft, the second Cardan joint will cancel the velocity errors introduced by the first Cardan joint and the aligned double Cardan joint will act as a CV joint.
A Thompson coupling is a refined version of the double Cardan joint.
It offers slightly increased efficiency with the penalty of great increase in complexity.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA  NITS-ə) is an agency of the U.S. federal government, part of the Department of Transportation, focused on transportation safety in the United States.
NHTSA is charged with writing and enforcing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards as well as regulations for motor vehicle theft resistance and fuel economy, as part of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) system.
FMVSS 209 was the first standard to become effective on March 1, 1967.
NHTSA licenses vehicle manufacturers and importers, allows or blocks the import of vehicles and safety-regulated vehicle parts, administers the vehicle identification number (VIN) system, develops the anthropomorphic dummies used in U.S. safety testing as well as the test protocols themselves, and provides vehicle insurance cost information.
The agency has asserted preemptive regulatory authority over greenhouse gas emissions, but this has been disputed by such state regulatory agencies as the California Air Resources Board.
The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards are contained in the United States 49 CFR 571.
Additional federal vehicle standards are contained elsewhere in the CFR.
Another of NHTSA's activities is the collection of data about motor vehicle crashes, available in various data files maintained by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis, in particular the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), the  Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS, where technicians investigate a random sample of police crash reports), and others.
In 1964 and 1966, public pressure grew in the United States to increase the safety of cars, culminating with the publishing of Unsafe at Any Speed, by Ralph Nader, an activist lawyer, and the report prepared by the National Academy of Sciences entitled Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society.
In 1966, Congress held a series of publicized hearings regarding highway safety, passed legislation to make the installation of seat belts mandatory, and created the U.S. Department of Transportation on October 15, 1966 (Pub.
L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 89–670).
Legislation signed by President Lyndon Johnson earlier on September 9, 1966, included the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Pub.
L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 89–563) and Highway Safety Act (Pub.
L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 89–564) that created the National Traffic Safety Agency, the National Highway Safety Agency, and the National Highway Safety Bureau, predecessor agencies to what would eventually become NHTSA.
Once the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) came into effect, vehicles not certified by the maker or importer as compliant with US safety standards were no longer legal to import into the United States.
Congress established NHTSA in 1970 with the Highway Safety Act of 1970 (Title II of Pub.
L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 91–605, 84 Stat. 1713, enacted December 31, 1970, at 84 Stat. 1739).
In 1972, the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Pub.
L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 92–513, 86 Stat.
947, enacted October 20, 1972) expanded NHTSA's scope to include consumer information programs.
Despite improvements in vehicle design and public awareness of issues like drunk driving, traffic fatalities have remained stubbornly high.
In the early 2020s, more than 40,000 U.S. residents died in automotive collisions every year.
NHTSA has conducted numerous high-profile investigations of automotive safety issues, including the Audi 5000/60 Minutes affair, the Ford Explorer rollover problem, and the Toyota sticky accelerator pedal problem.
The agency has introduced a proposal to mandate Electronic Stability Control on all passenger vehicles by the 2012 model year.
This technology was first brought to public attention in 1997, with the Swedish moose test.
Other than that, NHTSA has issued only a few regulations in the past 25 years.
Most of the reduction in vehicle fatality rates during the last third of the 20th century were gained from the initial NHTSA safety standards during 1968–1984 and subsequent voluntary changes in vehicle crashworthiness by vehicle manufacturers.
Audits by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of the Inspector General in 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2021 have concluded that NHTSA is ineffectual; the 2021 audit found NHTSA failing to issue or update Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards effectively or to act within timeframes on petitions and investigations; having no process in place for critical agency responsibilities like evaluating petitions, and having failed to implement consensus recommendations derived from the Inspector General's audit a decade before, in 2011.
The 2018 audit found NHTSA incapable of conducting adequate, timely safety recalls.
The 2015 audit found NHTSA's collection and analysis of safety-related data to be inadequate, and the agency to be lackadaisical and careless in examining safety defects.
Research suggests one reason the U.S. continues to lag in traffic safety is the relatively high prevalence in the U.S. of pickup trucks and SUVs, which a 2003 study by the U.S. Transportation Research Board found are significantly less safe than passenger cars.
Comparisons of past data with the present in the U.S. can result in distortions, due to a significant population increase and since the level of large commercial truck traffic has substantially increased from the 1960s, but highway capacity has not kept up.
However, other factors exert significant influence; Canada has lower roadway death and injury rates despite a vehicle mix and regulations similar to those of the U.S.
Nevertheless, the widespread use of truck-based vehicles as passenger carriers is correlated with roadway deaths and injuries not only directly by dint of vehicular safety performance per se, but also indirectly through the relatively low fuel costs that facilitate the use of such vehicles in North America.
Motor vehicle fatalities decline as gasoline prices increase.
In 1958, under the auspices of the United Nations, a consortium called the Economic Commission for Europe had been established to normalize vehicle regulations across Europe to standardize best practices in vehicle design and equipment and minimize technical barriers to pan-European vehicle trade and traffic.
This eventually became the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, which began to promulgate what would eventually become the UN Regulations on the design, construction, and safety and emissions performance of vehicles and their components.
Many of the world's countries accept or require vehicles and equipment built to the UN Regulations, but the U.S does not recognize the UN Regulations and blocks the importation of vehicles and components not manufacturer-certified as complying with the U.S. regulations.
Because of the unavailability in America of certain vehicle models, a grey market arose in the late 1970s.
This provided a method to acquire vehicles not officially offered in the United States, but enough vehicles imported this way were faulty, shoddy, and unsafe that Mercedes-Benz of North America helped launch a successful congressional lobbying effort to close down the grey market in 1988.
As a result, it was no longer possible to import foreign vehicles into the United States as a personal import, with few exceptions—primarily vehicles meeting Canadian regulations substantially similar to those of the United States, and vehicles imported temporarily for display or research purposes.
In practice, the gray market involved a few thousand cars annually, before its virtual elimination in 1988.
In 1998, NHTSA exempted vehicles older than 25 years from the rules it administers, since these are presumed to be collector vehicles.
In 1999, certain very low production volume specialist vehicles were also exempt for "Show and Display" purposes.
In the mid-1960s, when the framework was established for US vehicle safety regulations, the US auto market was an oligopoly, with three companies (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) controlling 85% of the market.
The ongoing ban on newer vehicles considered safe in countries with lower vehicle-related death rates has created a perception that an effect of NHTSA's regulatory activity is to protect the U.S. market for a modified oligopoly consisting of the three U.S.-based automakers and the American operations of foreign-brand producers.
It has been suggested that the impetus for NHTSA's seeming preoccupation with market control rather than vehicular safety performance is a result of overt market protections such as tariffs and local-content laws having become politically unpopular due to the increasing popularity of free trade, thus driving the industry to adopt less visible forms of trade restrictions in the form of technical regulations different from those outside the United States.
An example of the market-control effects of NHTSA's regulatory protocol is found in the agency's 1974 banning of the Citroën SM automobile, which contemporary journalists described as one of the safest vehicles available at the time.
NHTSA disapproved the SM's designs featuring steerable headlamps that were not of the sealed beam design that was then mandatory in the U.S. as well as its height adjustable suspension, which made compliance with the 1973 bumper requirements cost-prohibitive.
The initial bumper regulations were intended to prevent functional damage to a vehicle's safety-related components such as lights and fuel system components when subjected to barrier crash tests at 5 miles per hour (8 km/h) at the front and 2.5 mph (4 km/h) at the rear.
However, these regulations at low-speed collisions did not enhance occupant safety.
Vehicle manufacturers have acknowledged the functional equivalence of the UN and U.S. regulations, encouraged developing countries to recognize and accept both, and advocated for equal recognition of both systems in developed countries.
However, some structural features of the U.S. legal system are incompatible with some aspects of the UN regulatory system.
Studies have concluded that commonizing regulations between the US and the rest of the world (which uses U.N. Regulations) would save significant money, likely without affecting safety.
NHTSA uses cost–benefit analysis for every safety device, system, or design feature mandated for installation on vehicles.
No device, system, or design feature may be mandated unless it costs no more than a specified amount of money per life saved, or will save more money (in property damage, health care, etc.)
than it costs.
Requirements are balanced through estimated costs and estimated benefits.
For example, FMVSS #208 effectively mandates the installation of frontal airbags in all new vehicles in the United States, for it is written such that no other technology can meet the stipulated requirements.
It has been argued that even using conservative cost figures and optimistic benefit figures, airbags' cost–benefit ratio so extreme that it may fall outside of the cost–benefit requirements for mandatory safety devices.
Cost–benefit requirements have been used as the basis for lighting-related regulation in the U.S; for example, while many countries in the world since at least the early 1970s have required rear turn signals to emit amber light so they might be distinguished from adjacent red brake lamps, U.S. regulations permit rear turn signals to emit either amber or red light.
This has historically been justified on grounds of lower manufacturing cost and greater automaker styling freedom in the context of no demonstrated safety benefit to amber over red.
More recent NHTSA-sponsored research has demonstrated that amber rear turn signals provide significantly better crash avoidance than red ones, and NHTSA has found there is no significant cost penalty to amber signals versus red ones, yet the agency has not moved to require amber—instead proposing in 2015 to award extra NCAP points to passenger vehicles with amber rear turn signals.
As of September 2022, however, the agency has not put this proposal into effect.
NHTSA administers the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE), which is intended to incentivize the production of fuel-efficient vehicles by dint of fuel economy requirements measured against the sales-weighted harmonic average of each manufacturer's range of vehicles.
Many governments outside North America promote fuel economy by heavily taxing motor fuel and/or by including a vehicle's weight, engine size, or fuel economy in calculating vehicle registration taxes (road tax).
United States has been the first country/region to have a NCAP program before being copied by other regional, European, American, Asiatic, Oceanic or global NCAP programs.
This makes the New Car Assessment Program colloquial and design either US NCAP or generic NCAP.
In 1979, NHTSA created the/a New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) in response to Title II of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, to encourage manufacturers to build safer vehicles and consumers to buy them.
Since that time, the agency has improved the program by adding rating programs, facilitating access to test results, and revising the format of the information to make it easier for consumers to understand.
NHTSA asserts the program has influenced manufacturers to build vehicles that consistently achieve high ratings.
The first standardized 35 mph (56 km/h) front crash test was on May 21, 1979, and the first results were released on October 15 that year.
The agency established a frontal impact test protocol based on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 ("Occupant Crash Protection"), except that the frontal 4 NCAP test is conducted at 35 mph (56 km/h), rather than 30 mph (48 km/h) as required by FMVSS No. 208.
To improve the dissemination of NCAP ratings, and as a result of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA–LU), the agency has issued a Final Rule requiring manufacturers to place NCAP star ratings on the Monroney sticker (automobile price sticker).
The rule had a September 1, 2007 compliance date.
Since 2020, it is mandatory to show a safety label with all display vehicles in Malaysia.
The printed information does not show the presence of crash eCall, presence eCall, drunk driving warning, anti-theft and lack of keyless technology as features.
It does not seem that NCAPs less strict than the local one or which do not penalize flammability, fire toxicity, lifecycle toxicity, true climate impact, water impact, worker and population impact, biodiversity impact, weak cybersecurity, or heavy or pedestrian-unfriendly vehicles are banned.
The agency has an annual budget of $1.09 billion (FY2020).
The agency classifies most of its spending under the driver safety heading, with a minority spent on vehicle safety, and a smaller amount on energy security matters of which it is in charge, i.e., vehicular fuel economy.
A two-stroke (or two-stroke cycle) engine is a type of internal combustion engine that completes a power cycle with two strokes of the piston (one up and one down movement) in one revolution of the crankshaft.
A four-stroke engine requires four strokes of the piston to complete a power cycle in two crankshaft revolutions.
In a two-stroke engine, the end of the combustion stroke and the beginning of the compression stroke happen simultaneously, with the intake and exhaust (or scavenging) functions occurring at the same time.
Two-stroke engines often have a high power-to-weight ratio, power being available in a narrow range of rotational speeds called the power band.
Two-stroke engines have fewer moving parts than four-stroke engines, and thus are cheaper to manufacture.
In countries and regions with stringent emissions regulation, two-stroke engines have been phased out in automotive and motorcycle uses.
In regions where regulations are less stringent, small displacement two-stroke engines remain popular in mopeds and motorcycles.
They are also used in power tools such as chainsaws and leaf blowers.
The first commercial two-stroke engine involving cylinder compression is attributed to Scottish engineer Dugald Clerk, who patented his design in 1881.
However, unlike most later two-stroke engines, his had a separate charging cylinder.
The crankcase-scavenged engine, employing the area below the piston as a charging pump, is generally credited to Englishman Joseph Day.
On 31 December 1879, German inventor Karl Benz produced a two-stroke gas engine, for which he received a patent in 1880 in Germany.
The first truly practical two-stroke engine is attributed to Yorkshireman Alfred Angas Scott, who started producing twin-cylinder water-cooled motorcycles in 1908.
Two-stroke gasoline engines with electrical spark ignition are particularly useful in lightweight or portable applications such as chainsaws and motorcycles.
However, when weight and size are not an issue, the cycle's potential for high thermodynamic efficiency makes it ideal for diesel compression ignition engines operating in large, weight-insensitive applications, such as marine propulsion, railway locomotives, and electricity generation.
In a two-stroke engine, the exhaust gases transfer less heat to the cooling system than a four-stroke, which means more energy to drive the piston, and if present, a turbocharger.
Crankcase-compression two-stroke engines, such as common small gasoline-powered engines, are lubricated by a petroil mixture in a total-loss system.
Oil is mixed in with their petrol fuel beforehand, in a fuel-to-oil ratio of around 32:1.
This oil then forms emissions, either by being burned in the engine or as droplets in the exhaust, historically resulting in more exhaust emissions, particularly hydrocarbons, than four-stroke engines of comparable power output.
The combined opening time of the intake and exhaust ports in some two-stroke designs can also allow some amount of unburned fuel vapors to exit in the exhaust stream.
The high combustion temperatures of small, air-cooled engines may also produce NOx emissions.
Two-stroke gasoline engines are preferred when mechanical simplicity, light weight, and high power-to-weight ratio are design priorities.
By mixing oil with fuel, they can operate in any orientation as the oil reservoir does not depend on gravity.
A number of mainstream automobile manufacturers have used two-stroke engines in the past, including the Swedish Saab, German manufacturers DKW, Auto-Union, VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau, VEB Automobilwerk Eisenach, and VEB Fahrzeug- und Jagdwaffenwerk, and Polish manufacturers FSO and FSM.
The Japanese manufacturers Suzuki and Subaru did the same in the 1970s.
Production of two-stroke cars ended in the 1980s in the West, due to increasingly stringent regulation of air pollution.
Eastern Bloc countries continued until around 1991, with the Trabant and Wartburg in East Germany.
Two-stroke engines are still found in a variety of small propulsion applications, such as outboard motors, small on- and off-road motorcycles, mopeds, scooters, motorized bicycles, tuk-tuks, snowmobiles, go-karts, ultralight and model airplanes.
Particularly in developed countries, pollution regulations have meant that their use for many of these applications is being phased out.
Honda, for instance, ceased selling two-stroke off-road motorcycles in the United States in 2007, after abandoning road-going models considerably earlier.
Due to their high power-to-weight ratio and ability to be used in any orientation, two-stroke engines are common in handheld outdoor power tools including leaf blowers, chainsaws, and string trimmers.
Two-stroke diesel engines are found mostly in large industrial and marine applications, as well as some trucks and heavy machinery.
Although the principles remain the same, the mechanical details of various two-stroke engines differ depending on the type.
The design types vary according to the method of introducing the charge to the cylinder, the method of scavenging the cylinder (exchanging burnt exhaust for fresh mixture) and the method of exhausting the cylinder.
Piston port is the simplest of the designs and the most common in small two-stroke engines.
All functions are controlled solely by the piston covering and uncovering the ports as it moves up and down in the cylinder.
In the 1970s, Yamaha worked out some basic principles for this system.
They found that, in general, widening an exhaust port increases the power by the same amount as raising the port, but the power band does not narrow as it does when the port is raised.
However,  a mechanical limit exists to the width of a single exhaust port, at about 62% of the bore diameter for reasonable piston ring life.
Beyond this, the piston rings bulge into the exhaust port and wear quickly.
A maximum 70% of bore width is possible in racing engines, where rings are changed every few races.
Intake duration is between 120 and 160°.
Transfer port time is set at a minimum of 26°.
The strong, low-pressure pulse of a racing two-stroke expansion chamber can drop the pressure to -7 psi when the piston is at bottom dead center, and the transfer ports nearly wide open.
One of the reasons for high fuel consumption in two-strokes is that some of the incoming pressurized fuel-air mixture is forced across the top of the piston, where it has a cooling action, and straight out the exhaust pipe.
An expansion chamber with a strong reverse pulse  stops this outgoing flow.
A fundamental difference from typical four-stroke engines is that the two-stroke's crankcase is sealed and forms part of the induction process in gasoline and hot-bulb engines.
Diesel two-strokes often add a Roots blower or piston pump for scavenging.
The reed valve is a simple but highly effective form of check valve commonly fitted in the intake tract of the piston-controlled port.
It allows asymmetric intake of the fuel charge, improving power and economy, while widening the power band.
Such valves are widely used in motorcycle, ATV, and marine outboard engines.
The intake pathway is opened and closed by a rotating member.
A familiar type sometimes seen on small motorcycles is a slotted disk attached to the crankshaft, which covers and uncovers an opening in the end of the crankcase, allowing charge to enter during one portion of the cycle (called a disc valve).
Another form of rotary inlet valve used on two-stroke engines employs two cylindrical members with suitable cutouts arranged to rotate one within the other - the inlet pipe having passage to the crankcase only when the two cutouts coincide.
The crankshaft itself may form one of the members, as in most glow-plug model engines.
In another version, the crank disc is arranged to be a close-clearance fit in the crankcase, and is provided with a cutout that lines up with an inlet passage in the crankcase wall at the appropriate time, as in Vespa motor scooters.
The advantage of a rotary valve is that it enables the two-stroke engine's intake timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines.
The piston-port type engine's intake timing opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.
Rotary valve engines can be tailored to deliver power over a wider speed range or higher power over a narrower speed range than either a  piston-port or reed-valve engine.
Where a portion of the rotary valve is a portion of the crankcase itself, of particular importance, no wear should be allowed to take place.
In a cross-flow engine, the transfer and exhaust ports are on opposite sides of the cylinder, and a deflector on the top of the piston directs the fresh intake charge into the upper part of the cylinder, pushing the residual exhaust gas down the other side of the deflector and out the exhaust port.
The deflector increases the piston's weight and exposed surface area, and the fact that it makes piston cooling and achieving an effective combustion chamber shape more difficult is why this design has been largely superseded by uniflow scavenging after the 1960s, especially for motorcycles, but for smaller or slower engines using direct injection, the deflector piston can still be an acceptable approach.
This method of scavenging uses carefully shaped and positioned transfer ports to direct the flow of fresh mixture toward the combustion chamber as it enters the cylinder.
The fuel/air mixture strikes the cylinder head, then follows the curvature of the combustion chamber, and then is deflected downward.
Usually, a piston deflector is not required, so this approach has a distinct advantage over the cross-flow scheme (above).
Often referred to as "Schnuerle" (or "Schnürle") loop scavenging after Adolf Schnürle, the German inventor of an early form in the mid-1920s, it became widely adopted in that country during the 1930s and spread further afield after World War II.
Loop scavenging is the most common type of fuel/air mixture transfer used on modern two-stroke engines.
Suzuki was one of the first manufacturers outside of Europe to adopt loop-scavenged, two-stroke engines.
This operational feature was used in conjunction with the expansion chamber exhaust developed by German motorcycle manufacturer, MZ, and Walter Kaaden.
Loop scavenging, disc valves, and expansion chambers worked in a highly coordinated way to significantly increase the power output of two-stroke engines, particularly from the Japanese manufacturers Suzuki, Yamaha, and Kawasaki.
Suzuki and Yamaha enjoyed success in Grand Prix motorcycle racing in the 1960s due in no small way to the increased power afforded by loop scavenging.
An additional benefit of loop scavenging was the piston could be made nearly flat or slightly domed, which allowed the piston to be appreciably lighter and stronger, and consequently to tolerate higher engine speeds.
The "flat top" piston also has better thermal properties and is less prone to uneven heating, expansion, piston seizures, dimensional changes, and compression losses.
SAAB built 750- and 850-cc three-cylinder engines based on a DKW design that proved reasonably successful employing loop charging.
The original SAAB 92 had a two-cylinder engine of comparatively low efficiency.
At cruising speed, reflected-wave, exhaust-port blocking occurred at too low a frequency.
Using the asymmetrical three-port exhaust manifold employed in the identical DKW engine improved fuel economy.
The 750-cc standard engine produced 36 to 42 hp, depending on the model year.
The Monte Carlo Rally variant, 750-cc (with a filled crankshaft for higher base compression), generated 65 hp.
An 850-cc version was available in the 1966 SAAB Sport (a standard trim model in comparison to the deluxe trim of the Monte Carlo).
Base compression comprises a portion of the overall compression ratio of a two-stroke engine.
Work published at SAE in 2012 points that loop scavenging is under every circumstance more efficient than cross-flow scavenging.
In a uniflow engine, the mixture, or "charge air" in the case of a diesel, enters at one end of the cylinder controlled by the piston and the exhaust exits at the other end controlled by an exhaust valve or piston.
The scavenging gas-flow is, therefore, in one direction only, hence the name uniflow.
The design using exhaust valve(s) is common in on-road, off-road, and stationary two-stroke engines (Detroit Diesel), certain small marine two-stroke engines (Gray Marine Motor Company, which adapted the Detroit Diesel Series 71 for marine use), certain railroad two-stroke diesel locomotives (Electro-Motive Diesel) and large marine two-stroke main propulsion engines (Wärtsilä).
Ported types are represented by the opposed piston design in which two pistons are in each cylinder, working in opposite directions such as the Junkers Jumo 205 and Napier Deltic.
The once-popular split-single design falls into this class, being effectively a folded uniflow.
With advanced-angle exhaust timing, uniflow engines can be supercharged with a crankshaft-driven blower, either piston or Roots-type.
The piston of this engine is "top-hat"-shaped; the upper section forms the regular cylinder, and the lower section performs a scavenging function.
The units run in pairs, with the lower half of one piston charging an adjacent combustion chamber.
The upper section of the piston still relies on total-loss lubrication, but the other engine parts are sump lubricated with cleanliness and reliability benefits.
The mass of the piston is only about 20% more than a loop-scavenged engine's piston because skirt thicknesses can be less.
Many modern two-stroke engines employ a power-valve system.
The valves are normally in or around the exhaust ports.
They work in one of two ways; either they alter the exhaust port by closing off the top part of the port, which alters port timing, such as Rotax R.A.V.E, Yamaha YPVS, Honda RC-Valve, Kawasaki K.I.P.S., Cagiva C.T.S., or Suzuki AETC systems, or by altering the volume of the exhaust, which changes the resonant frequency of the expansion chamber, such as the Suzuki SAEC and Honda V-TACS system.
The result is an engine with better low-speed power without sacrificing high-speed power.
However, as power valves are in the hot gas flow, they need regular maintenance to perform well.
Direct injection has considerable advantages in two-stroke engines.
In carburetted two-strokes, a major problem is a portion of the fuel/air mixture going directly out, unburned, through the exhaust port, and direct injection effectively eliminates this problem.
Two systems are in use, low-pressure air-assisted injection and high-pressure injection.
Since the fuel does not pass through the crankcase, a separate source of lubrication is needed.
For the purpose of this discussion, it is convenient to think in motorcycle terms, where the exhaust pipe faces into the cooling air stream, and the crankshaft commonly spins in the same axis and direction as do the wheels i.e. "forward".
Some of the considerations discussed here apply to four-stroke engines (which cannot reverse their direction of rotation without considerable modification), almost all of which spin forward, too.
It is also useful to note that the "front" and "back" faces of the piston are - respectively - the exhaust port and intake port sides of it, and are not to do with the top or bottom of the piston.
Regular gasoline two-stroke engines can run backward for short periods and under light load with little problem, and this has been used to provide a reversing facility in microcars, such as the Messerschmitt KR200, that lacked reverse gearing.
Where the vehicle has electric starting, the motor is turned off and restarted backward by turning the key in the opposite direction.
Two-stroke golf carts have used a similar system.
Traditional flywheel magnetos (using contact-breaker points, but no external coil) worked equally well in reverse because the cam controlling the points is symmetrical, breaking contact before top dead center  equally well whether running forward or backward.
Reed-valve engines run backward just as well as piston-controlled porting, though rotary valve engines have asymmetrical inlet timing and do not run very well.
Serious disadvantages exist for running many engines backward under load for any length of time, and some of these reasons are general, applying equally to both two-stroke and four-stroke engines.
This disadvantage is accepted in most cases where cost, weight, and size are major considerations.
The problem comes about because in "forward" running, the major thrust face of the piston is on the back face of the cylinder, which in a two-stroke particularly, is the coolest and best-lubricated part.
The forward face of the piston in a trunk engine is less well-suited to be the major thrust face, since it covers and uncovers the exhaust port in the cylinder, the hottest part of the engine, where piston lubrication is at its most marginal.
The front face of the piston is also more vulnerable since the exhaust port, the largest in the engine, is in the front wall of the cylinder.
Piston skirts and rings risk being extruded into this port, so  having them pressing hardest on the opposite wall (where there are only the transfer ports in a crossflow engine) is always best and  support is good.
In some engines, the small end is offset to reduce thrust in the intended rotational direction and the forward face of the piston has been made thinner and lighter to compensate, but when running backward, this weaker forward face suffers increased mechanical stress it was not designed to resist.
This can be avoided by the use of crossheads and also using thrust bearings to isolate the engine from end loads.
Large two-stroke ship diesels are sometimes made to be reversible.
Like four-stroke ship engines (some of which are also reversible), they use mechanically operated valves, so require additional camshaft mechanisms.
These engines use crossheads to eliminate sidethrust on the piston and isolate the under-piston space from the crankcase.
On top of other considerations, the oil pump of a modern two-stroke may not work in reverse, in which case the engine suffers oil starvation within a short time.
Running a motorcycle engine backward is relatively easy to initiate, and in rare cases, can be triggered by a back-fire.
It is not advisable.
Model airplane engines with reed valves can be mounted in either tractor or pusher configuration without needing to change the propeller.
These motors are compression ignition, so  no ignition timing issues and little difference between running forward and running backward are seen.
A ute ( YOOT), originally an abbreviation for "utility" or "coupé utility", is a term used in Australia and New Zealand to describe vehicles with a tonneau behind the passenger compartment, that can be driven with a regular driver's licence.
Traditionally, the term referred to vehicles built on passenger car chassis and with the cargo tray integrated with the passenger body (coupé utility vehicles).
However, present-day usage of the term "ute" in Australia and New Zealand has expanded to include any vehicle with an open cargo area at the rear, which would be called a pickup truck in other countries.
Historically, the term "ute" (short for 'utility vehicle') has been used to describe a 2-door vehicle based on a passenger car chassis, such as the Ford Ranchero, Holden Commodore, Australian Ford Falcon, Chevrolet El Camino and Subaru BRAT.
Australian-produced utes were traditionally rear-wheel drive and with the cargo tray integrated with the passenger body (as opposed to a pickup truck, where the cargo tray is separated from the passenger body).
In the 21st century, the term has become more broadly used, for any vehicle with a cargo tray at the rear (which would be called a pickup truck in other countries).
The concept of a two-door vehicle based on a passenger car chassis with a tray at the rear began in the United States in the 1920s with the roadster utility (also called "roadster pickup" or "light delivery") models.
These vehicles were soft-top convertibles, compared with the fixed steel roof used by most utes.
Ford Australia was the first company to produce an Australian Coupe ute, which was released in 1934.
This was the result of a 1932 letter from the unnamed wife of a farmer in Australia asking for "a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays".
In response, Ford designer Lew Bandt designed a two-door body with a tray at the rear for the American Ford Model A chassis, and the model was named "coupe utility".
When the Australian version was displayed in the US, Henry Ford nicknamed it the "Kangaroo Chaser".
A convertible version, known as the roadster utility was produced in limited numbers by Ford in the 1930s.
In 1951, Holden released a "utility" model, which was based on the 48–215 sedan.
With both Ford and Holden now producing utes, this started the long-standing tradition of Australian-designed 2 door vehicles with a tray at the back, based on a passenger-car sedan chassis.
Australia has developed a culture around utes, particularly in rural areas with events known as ute musters.
It is common, particularly in rural areas, to customise utes in the "B&S style" with bullbars, spotlights, oversized mudflaps, exhaust pipe flaps and UHF aerials.
Since 1998, the "Deni Ute Muster" has been held in the town of Deniliquin, which has become a major attraction for the area.
High performance utes were also sold in Australia, including the FPV F6 and the HSV Maloo.
The 2017 HSV GTSR Maloo is powered by a 6.2 L (378 cu in) supercharged V8 engine producing 435 kW (583 hp).
The Australian V8 Utes is a racing series based on lightly modified production Holden and Ford utes.
The ute variant of the Ford Falcon was produced from 1961 to 2016.
For the first 38 years of production, the design used a coupe ute style, but with the introduction of the 1999 AU Falcon, the Falcon ute switched to a cargo bed that is separate from the cabin, while still retaining the Falcon sedan front-end and cabin.
The cargo bed was separated so that both "utility" and "cab chassis" body styles could be produced together.
In addition, the Ford Ranger (T6) was designed by Ford Australia, but built elsewhere.
It was the second best selling new car in Australia in 2019 and 2020.
From 1951 to 1968, the "utility" was sold as part of the 48–215 to HR model ranges.
From 1968 to 1984 the "utility" was included in the Holden Belmont/Kingswood range.
In 1984, Holden discontinued the ute variant and it was not part of the VB to VL Commodore ranges.
The model returned in 1990 based on the VN Commodore chassis and remained part of the model range until Australian production ended in 2017.
In 2000, the Holden Commodore was the first Australian ute to feature independent rear suspension, the Ford Falcon ute retained a live axle rear suspension design until production ended in 2016.
In 2008, the VE Commodore Ute was proposed to be exported to North America as the Pontiac G8 ST.
At least one prototype was built, but GM decided not to proceed with production due to the Global Financial Crisis.

Between 2002 and 2010, the Proton Jumbuck was sold in Australia as a ute.
Subaru produced the Subaru Brumby, a small AWD model derived from the second generation Leone.
It was sold between 1978 and 1993 and known as the BRAT, Shifter, MV, and Targa in countries other than Australia.
It is relatively well known due to its long production life and use in popular culture.
It was built in Japan, but never sold there.
From 1983 to 1988, Suzuki built a ute version of their Alto kei car called the Mighty Boy.
It was sold in Japan, Australia, and Cyprus.
Between 1960 and 1970, Toyota sold a ute variant of the second- and third-generation Corona with an integral bed.
It was sold alongside its eventual replacement, the Toyota Hilux, for a couple of years before it was discontinued.
Toyota also sold a locally produced CKD ute based on the second- and third-generation Crown (also known as S40 and S50), assembled by Australian Motor Industries.
Toyota currently sells a ute variant of the Toyota Land Cruiser (J70).
In 2011, the Toyota Hilux was Australia's highest selling ute.
Between 2017 and 2020, the Mercedes-Benz X-Class was sold in Australia.
It used the chassis of the Nissan Navara.
Volkswagen has sold the Volkswagen Amarok, a pickup style ute since 2010.
From 1979 to 2004, Volkswagen sold the Caddy, a pickup based upon the Volkswagen Golf platform.
Valentigney (French pronunciation: [valɑ̃ti'ɲɛ]) is a commune in the Doubs department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in eastern France.
Valentigney is best known as the place where Peugeot began operations; several members of the Peugeot family still live in the area.
During the 19th century and into the early 20th century, many Montbeliardaise from Valentigney and neighboring areas immigrated to northwest Ohio, particularly Williams County.
A V engine, sometimes called a Vee engine, is a common configuration for internal combustion engines.
It consists of two cylinder banks—usually with the same number of cylinders in each bank—connected to a common crankshaft.
These cylinder banks are arranged at an angle to each other, so that the banks form a "V" shape when viewed from the front of the engine.
V engines typically have a shorter length than equivalent inline engines, however the trade-off is a larger width.
V6, V8 and V12 engines are the most common layout for automobile engines with 6, 8 or 12 cylinders respectively.
The first V engine, a two-cylinder V-twin, was designed by Wilhelm Maybach and used in the 1889 Daimler Stahlradwagen automobile.
The first V8 engine was produced in 1903, in the form of the Antoinette engine designed by Léon Levavasseur for racing boats and airplanes.
The first V12 engine was produced the following year by Putney Motor Works in London, again for use in racing boats.
The first V6 engine to reach production appeared soon after in 1908, by the Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik in Germany for use as a generator for gasoline-electric railway engines.
However, it was not until 1950 that the V6 engine was used in series production automobiles, with the first example being the Lancia V6 engine.
This V6 engine used a 60-degree V angle and separate crankpins for each cylinder, to reduce the vibration issues experienced by earlier attempts at production V6 engines.
twin and straight-twin engines might be insignificant, however V8 engines have a significantly smaller length than straight engines.
Compared with the less common flat engine, a V engine is narrower, taller and has a higher center of mass.
The "V-angle" (or "included angle") between the cylinder banks varies significantly between engines.
Some engines have used a V-angle of 180 degrees (the same angle as a flat engine), such as several Ferrari V12 engines.
At the other end of the scale, the 1922-1976 Lancia V4 engine and the 1991–present Volkswagen VR6 engine use V-angles as small as 10 degrees, along with a single cylinder head used by both banks of cylinders.
The engine balance of a V12 engine is that of perfect primary and secondary balance.
For V engines with fewer cylinders, the engine balance will depend on factors such as the firing interval, crankshaft counterweights and whether balance shafts are present.
The crankpins on a V engine are usually shared by two cylinders from opposing banks, with an offset between the two cylinders.
Alternative configurations are separate crankpins per cylinder (such as several V-twin engines) or articulated connecting rods (for example, the such as the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine).
Some airplanes of the 1920s and 1930s used inverted engines, whereby the crankshaft is located at the top of the engine and the cylinder heads are at the bottom.
Advantages include better visibility in a single-engined airplane, a higher thrust line, and resultant increased ground clearance for the propeller.
Examples include the 1928 Argus As 10 V8 engine and the 1935 Daimler-Benz DB 601 V12 engines.
A vacuum servo is a component used on motor vehicles in their braking system, to provide assistance to the driver by decreasing the braking effort.
In the US it is commonly called a brake booster.
Because the servo depends on the vacuum supplied by a running engine, a check valve is typically used in the vacuum line to maintain residual vacuum without engine support, allowing limited use even after parking.
A two-stroke (or two-stroke cycle) engine is a type of internal combustion engine that completes a power cycle with two strokes of the piston (one up and one down movement) in one revolution of the crankshaft.
A four-stroke engine requires four strokes of the piston to complete a power cycle in two crankshaft revolutions.
In a two-stroke engine, the end of the combustion stroke and the beginning of the compression stroke happen simultaneously, with the intake and exhaust (or scavenging) functions occurring at the same time.
Two-stroke engines often have a high power-to-weight ratio, power being available in a narrow range of rotational speeds called the power band.
Two-stroke engines have fewer moving parts than four-stroke engines, and thus are cheaper to manufacture.
In countries and regions with stringent emissions regulation, two-stroke engines have been phased out in automotive and motorcycle uses.
In regions where regulations are less stringent, small displacement two-stroke engines remain popular in mopeds and motorcycles.
They are also used in power tools such as chainsaws and leaf blowers.
The first commercial two-stroke engine involving cylinder compression is attributed to Scottish engineer Dugald Clerk, who patented his design in 1881.
However, unlike most later two-stroke engines, his had a separate charging cylinder.
The crankcase-scavenged engine, employing the area below the piston as a charging pump, is generally credited to Englishman Joseph Day.
On 31 December 1879, German inventor Karl Benz produced a two-stroke gas engine, for which he received a patent in 1880 in Germany.
The first truly practical two-stroke engine is attributed to Yorkshireman Alfred Angas Scott, who started producing twin-cylinder water-cooled motorcycles in 1908.
Two-stroke gasoline engines with electrical spark ignition are particularly useful in lightweight or portable applications such as chainsaws and motorcycles.
However, when weight and size are not an issue, the cycle's potential for high thermodynamic efficiency makes it ideal for diesel compression ignition engines operating in large, weight-insensitive applications, such as marine propulsion, railway locomotives, and electricity generation.
In a two-stroke engine, the exhaust gases transfer less heat to the cooling system than a four-stroke, which means more energy to drive the piston, and if present, a turbocharger.
Crankcase-compression two-stroke engines, such as common small gasoline-powered engines, are lubricated by a petroil mixture in a total-loss system.
Oil is mixed in with their petrol fuel beforehand, in a fuel-to-oil ratio of around 32:1.
This oil then forms emissions, either by being burned in the engine or as droplets in the exhaust, historically resulting in more exhaust emissions, particularly hydrocarbons, than four-stroke engines of comparable power output.
The combined opening time of the intake and exhaust ports in some two-stroke designs can also allow some amount of unburned fuel vapors to exit in the exhaust stream.
The high combustion temperatures of small, air-cooled engines may also produce NOx emissions.
Two-stroke gasoline engines are preferred when mechanical simplicity, light weight, and high power-to-weight ratio are design priorities.
By mixing oil with fuel, they can operate in any orientation as the oil reservoir does not depend on gravity.
A number of mainstream automobile manufacturers have used two-stroke engines in the past, including the Swedish Saab, German manufacturers DKW, Auto-Union, VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau, VEB Automobilwerk Eisenach, and VEB Fahrzeug- und Jagdwaffenwerk, and Polish manufacturers FSO and FSM.
The Japanese manufacturers Suzuki and Subaru did the same in the 1970s.
Production of two-stroke cars ended in the 1980s in the West, due to increasingly stringent regulation of air pollution.
Eastern Bloc countries continued until around 1991, with the Trabant and Wartburg in East Germany.
Two-stroke engines are still found in a variety of small propulsion applications, such as outboard motors, small on- and off-road motorcycles, mopeds, scooters, motorized bicycles, tuk-tuks, snowmobiles, go-karts, ultralight and model airplanes.
Particularly in developed countries, pollution regulations have meant that their use for many of these applications is being phased out.
Honda, for instance, ceased selling two-stroke off-road motorcycles in the United States in 2007, after abandoning road-going models considerably earlier.
Due to their high power-to-weight ratio and ability to be used in any orientation, two-stroke engines are common in handheld outdoor power tools including leaf blowers, chainsaws, and string trimmers.
Two-stroke diesel engines are found mostly in large industrial and marine applications, as well as some trucks and heavy machinery.
Although the principles remain the same, the mechanical details of various two-stroke engines differ depending on the type.
The design types vary according to the method of introducing the charge to the cylinder, the method of scavenging the cylinder (exchanging burnt exhaust for fresh mixture) and the method of exhausting the cylinder.
Piston port is the simplest of the designs and the most common in small two-stroke engines.
All functions are controlled solely by the piston covering and uncovering the ports as it moves up and down in the cylinder.
In the 1970s, Yamaha worked out some basic principles for this system.
They found that, in general, widening an exhaust port increases the power by the same amount as raising the port, but the power band does not narrow as it does when the port is raised.
However,  a mechanical limit exists to the width of a single exhaust port, at about 62% of the bore diameter for reasonable piston ring life.
Beyond this, the piston rings bulge into the exhaust port and wear quickly.
A maximum 70% of bore width is possible in racing engines, where rings are changed every few races.
Intake duration is between 120 and 160°.
Transfer port time is set at a minimum of 26°.
The strong, low-pressure pulse of a racing two-stroke expansion chamber can drop the pressure to -7 psi when the piston is at bottom dead center, and the transfer ports nearly wide open.
One of the reasons for high fuel consumption in two-strokes is that some of the incoming pressurized fuel-air mixture is forced across the top of the piston, where it has a cooling action, and straight out the exhaust pipe.
An expansion chamber with a strong reverse pulse  stops this outgoing flow.
A fundamental difference from typical four-stroke engines is that the two-stroke's crankcase is sealed and forms part of the induction process in gasoline and hot-bulb engines.
Diesel two-strokes often add a Roots blower or piston pump for scavenging.
The reed valve is a simple but highly effective form of check valve commonly fitted in the intake tract of the piston-controlled port.
It allows asymmetric intake of the fuel charge, improving power and economy, while widening the power band.
Such valves are widely used in motorcycle, ATV, and marine outboard engines.
The intake pathway is opened and closed by a rotating member.
A familiar type sometimes seen on small motorcycles is a slotted disk attached to the crankshaft, which covers and uncovers an opening in the end of the crankcase, allowing charge to enter during one portion of the cycle (called a disc valve).
Another form of rotary inlet valve used on two-stroke engines employs two cylindrical members with suitable cutouts arranged to rotate one within the other - the inlet pipe having passage to the crankcase only when the two cutouts coincide.
The crankshaft itself may form one of the members, as in most glow-plug model engines.
In another version, the crank disc is arranged to be a close-clearance fit in the crankcase, and is provided with a cutout that lines up with an inlet passage in the crankcase wall at the appropriate time, as in Vespa motor scooters.
The advantage of a rotary valve is that it enables the two-stroke engine's intake timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines.
The piston-port type engine's intake timing opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.
Rotary valve engines can be tailored to deliver power over a wider speed range or higher power over a narrower speed range than either a  piston-port or reed-valve engine.
Where a portion of the rotary valve is a portion of the crankcase itself, of particular importance, no wear should be allowed to take place.
In a cross-flow engine, the transfer and exhaust ports are on opposite sides of the cylinder, and a deflector on the top of the piston directs the fresh intake charge into the upper part of the cylinder, pushing the residual exhaust gas down the other side of the deflector and out the exhaust port.
The deflector increases the piston's weight and exposed surface area, and the fact that it makes piston cooling and achieving an effective combustion chamber shape more difficult is why this design has been largely superseded by uniflow scavenging after the 1960s, especially for motorcycles, but for smaller or slower engines using direct injection, the deflector piston can still be an acceptable approach.
This method of scavenging uses carefully shaped and positioned transfer ports to direct the flow of fresh mixture toward the combustion chamber as it enters the cylinder.
The fuel/air mixture strikes the cylinder head, then follows the curvature of the combustion chamber, and then is deflected downward.
Usually, a piston deflector is not required, so this approach has a distinct advantage over the cross-flow scheme (above).
Often referred to as "Schnuerle" (or "Schnürle") loop scavenging after Adolf Schnürle, the German inventor of an early form in the mid-1920s, it became widely adopted in that country during the 1930s and spread further afield after World War II.
Loop scavenging is the most common type of fuel/air mixture transfer used on modern two-stroke engines.
Suzuki was one of the first manufacturers outside of Europe to adopt loop-scavenged, two-stroke engines.
This operational feature was used in conjunction with the expansion chamber exhaust developed by German motorcycle manufacturer, MZ, and Walter Kaaden.
Loop scavenging, disc valves, and expansion chambers worked in a highly coordinated way to significantly increase the power output of two-stroke engines, particularly from the Japanese manufacturers Suzuki, Yamaha, and Kawasaki.
Suzuki and Yamaha enjoyed success in Grand Prix motorcycle racing in the 1960s due in no small way to the increased power afforded by loop scavenging.
An additional benefit of loop scavenging was the piston could be made nearly flat or slightly domed, which allowed the piston to be appreciably lighter and stronger, and consequently to tolerate higher engine speeds.
The "flat top" piston also has better thermal properties and is less prone to uneven heating, expansion, piston seizures, dimensional changes, and compression losses.
SAAB built 750- and 850-cc three-cylinder engines based on a DKW design that proved reasonably successful employing loop charging.
The original SAAB 92 had a two-cylinder engine of comparatively low efficiency.
At cruising speed, reflected-wave, exhaust-port blocking occurred at too low a frequency.
Using the asymmetrical three-port exhaust manifold employed in the identical DKW engine improved fuel economy.
The 750-cc standard engine produced 36 to 42 hp, depending on the model year.
The Monte Carlo Rally variant, 750-cc (with a filled crankshaft for higher base compression), generated 65 hp.
An 850-cc version was available in the 1966 SAAB Sport (a standard trim model in comparison to the deluxe trim of the Monte Carlo).
Base compression comprises a portion of the overall compression ratio of a two-stroke engine.
Work published at SAE in 2012 points that loop scavenging is under every circumstance more efficient than cross-flow scavenging.
In a uniflow engine, the mixture, or "charge air" in the case of a diesel, enters at one end of the cylinder controlled by the piston and the exhaust exits at the other end controlled by an exhaust valve or piston.
The scavenging gas-flow is, therefore, in one direction only, hence the name uniflow.
The design using exhaust valve(s) is common in on-road, off-road, and stationary two-stroke engines (Detroit Diesel), certain small marine two-stroke engines (Gray Marine Motor Company, which adapted the Detroit Diesel Series 71 for marine use), certain railroad two-stroke diesel locomotives (Electro-Motive Diesel) and large marine two-stroke main propulsion engines (Wärtsilä).
Ported types are represented by the opposed piston design in which two pistons are in each cylinder, working in opposite directions such as the Junkers Jumo 205 and Napier Deltic.
The once-popular split-single design falls into this class, being effectively a folded uniflow.
With advanced-angle exhaust timing, uniflow engines can be supercharged with a crankshaft-driven blower, either piston or Roots-type.
The piston of this engine is "top-hat"-shaped; the upper section forms the regular cylinder, and the lower section performs a scavenging function.
The units run in pairs, with the lower half of one piston charging an adjacent combustion chamber.
The upper section of the piston still relies on total-loss lubrication, but the other engine parts are sump lubricated with cleanliness and reliability benefits.
The mass of the piston is only about 20% more than a loop-scavenged engine's piston because skirt thicknesses can be less.
Many modern two-stroke engines employ a power-valve system.
The valves are normally in or around the exhaust ports.
They work in one of two ways; either they alter the exhaust port by closing off the top part of the port, which alters port timing, such as Rotax R.A.V.E, Yamaha YPVS, Honda RC-Valve, Kawasaki K.I.P.S., Cagiva C.T.S., or Suzuki AETC systems, or by altering the volume of the exhaust, which changes the resonant frequency of the expansion chamber, such as the Suzuki SAEC and Honda V-TACS system.
The result is an engine with better low-speed power without sacrificing high-speed power.
However, as power valves are in the hot gas flow, they need regular maintenance to perform well.
Direct injection has considerable advantages in two-stroke engines.
In carburetted two-strokes, a major problem is a portion of the fuel/air mixture going directly out, unburned, through the exhaust port, and direct injection effectively eliminates this problem.
Two systems are in use, low-pressure air-assisted injection and high-pressure injection.
Since the fuel does not pass through the crankcase, a separate source of lubrication is needed.
For the purpose of this discussion, it is convenient to think in motorcycle terms, where the exhaust pipe faces into the cooling air stream, and the crankshaft commonly spins in the same axis and direction as do the wheels i.e. "forward".
Some of the considerations discussed here apply to four-stroke engines (which cannot reverse their direction of rotation without considerable modification), almost all of which spin forward, too.
It is also useful to note that the "front" and "back" faces of the piston are - respectively - the exhaust port and intake port sides of it, and are not to do with the top or bottom of the piston.
Regular gasoline two-stroke engines can run backward for short periods and under light load with little problem, and this has been used to provide a reversing facility in microcars, such as the Messerschmitt KR200, that lacked reverse gearing.
Where the vehicle has electric starting, the motor is turned off and restarted backward by turning the key in the opposite direction.
Two-stroke golf carts have used a similar system.
Traditional flywheel magnetos (using contact-breaker points, but no external coil) worked equally well in reverse because the cam controlling the points is symmetrical, breaking contact before top dead center  equally well whether running forward or backward.
Reed-valve engines run backward just as well as piston-controlled porting, though rotary valve engines have asymmetrical inlet timing and do not run very well.
Serious disadvantages exist for running many engines backward under load for any length of time, and some of these reasons are general, applying equally to both two-stroke and four-stroke engines.
This disadvantage is accepted in most cases where cost, weight, and size are major considerations.
The problem comes about because in "forward" running, the major thrust face of the piston is on the back face of the cylinder, which in a two-stroke particularly, is the coolest and best-lubricated part.
The forward face of the piston in a trunk engine is less well-suited to be the major thrust face, since it covers and uncovers the exhaust port in the cylinder, the hottest part of the engine, where piston lubrication is at its most marginal.
The front face of the piston is also more vulnerable since the exhaust port, the largest in the engine, is in the front wall of the cylinder.
Piston skirts and rings risk being extruded into this port, so  having them pressing hardest on the opposite wall (where there are only the transfer ports in a crossflow engine) is always best and  support is good.
In some engines, the small end is offset to reduce thrust in the intended rotational direction and the forward face of the piston has been made thinner and lighter to compensate, but when running backward, this weaker forward face suffers increased mechanical stress it was not designed to resist.
This can be avoided by the use of crossheads and also using thrust bearings to isolate the engine from end loads.
Large two-stroke ship diesels are sometimes made to be reversible.
Like four-stroke ship engines (some of which are also reversible), they use mechanically operated valves, so require additional camshaft mechanisms.
These engines use crossheads to eliminate sidethrust on the piston and isolate the under-piston space from the crankcase.
On top of other considerations, the oil pump of a modern two-stroke may not work in reverse, in which case the engine suffers oil starvation within a short time.
Running a motorcycle engine backward is relatively easy to initiate, and in rare cases, can be triggered by a back-fire.
It is not advisable.
Model airplane engines with reed valves can be mounted in either tractor or pusher configuration without needing to change the propeller.
These motors are compression ignition, so  no ignition timing issues and little difference between running forward and running backward are seen.
Urban decay (also known as urban rot, urban death or urban blight) is the sociological process by which a previously functioning city, or part of a city, falls into disrepair and decrepitude.
There is no single process that leads to urban decay.
Since the 1970s and 1980s, urban decay has been a phenomenon associated with some Western cities, especially in North America and parts of Europe.
Cities have experienced population flights to the suburbs and exurb commuter towns; often in the form of white flight.
Another characteristic of urban decay is blight – the visual, psychological, and physical effects of living among empty lots, buildings, and condemned houses.
Urban decay is often the result of inter-related socio-economic issues, including urban planning decisions, economic deprivation of the local populace, the construction of freeways and railroad lines that bypass or run through the area, depopulation by suburbanization of peripheral lands, real estate neighborhood redlining, and immigration restrictions.
During the Industrial Revolution, many people moved from rural areas to cities for employment in the manufacturing industry, thus causing urban populations to boom.
Subsequent economic change left many cities economically vulnerable.
Studies such as the Urban Task Force (DETR 1999), the Urban White Paper (DETR 2000), and a study of Scottish cities (2003) hypothesize areas suffering from industrial decline, high unemployment, poverty, and a decaying physical environment (sometimes including contaminated land and obsolete infrastructure)—prove "highly resistant to improvement".
Changes in transportation from public to private, (specifically the private motor car) eliminated some of the cities' public transport service advantages, e.g., fixed-route buses and trains.
In particular, at the end of World War II, many political decisions favored suburban development and encouraged suburbanization through financial incentives like government supported FHA loans and VA mortgage aid.
This allowed many veterans of World War II and their families to afford comfortable single family housing in suburbs.
The manufacturing industry has historically been a base for the prosperity of major cities.
When these industries relocate to larger, less urban environments, some cities have experienced population loss with associated urban decay, and even riots.
Cutbacks on police and fire services may result, while lobbying for government funded housing may increase.
Increased city taxes encourage residents to move out.
Libertarian economists argue that rent control contributes to urban blight by reducing new construction and investment in housing and discouraging maintenance.
Historically in the United States, the white middle class gradually left the cities for suburban areas due to African-American migration north toward cities after World War I. Some historians differentiate between the first Great Migration (1910–1930), numbering about 1.6 million African-American migrants who left mostly Southern rural areas to migrate to northern and Midwestern industrial cities, and, after a lull during the Great Depression, a Second Great Migration (1940–1970), in which 5 million or more African-Americans moved, including many to California and various western cities.
Between 1910 and 1970, African-Americans moved from southern States, especially Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to other regions of the United States, many of them townspeople with urban skills.
By the end of the Second Great Migration, African-Americans had become an urbanized population, with more than 80% of Black Americans living in cities.
A majority of 53 percent remained in the South, while 40 percent lived in the Northeast and Midwest and 7 percent in the West.
From the 1930s until 1977, African-Americans seeking borrowed capital for housing and businesses were discriminated against via the federal-government–legislated discriminatory lending practices for the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) via redlining.
In 1977, the US Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act, designed to encourage commercial banks and savings associations to help meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
Later urban centers were drained further through the advent of mass car ownership, the marketing of suburbia as a location to move to, and the building of the Interstate Highway System.
In North America, this shift manifested itself in strip malls, suburban retail and employment centers, and low-density housing estates.
Large areas of many northern cities in the United States experienced population decreases and a degradation of urban areas.
Inner-city property values declined, and economically disadvantaged populations moved in.
In the U.S., the new inner-city poor were often African-Americans that migrated from the South in the 1920s and 1930s.
As they moved into traditional white neighborhoods, ethnic frictions served to accelerate flight to the suburbs.
Like many industrial nations before the Second World War, the United Kingdom carried out extensive slum clearances.
These efforts continued after the war, however in many of these slums, depopulation became common, producing compounding decay.
The UK is unlike much of Europe in having high overall population density, but low urban population density outside of London.
In London, many former slum neighbourhoods like in Islington became "highly prized", however this was the exception to the rule, and much of the north of England remains deprived.
The Joseph Rowntree Foundation in the 1980s and 1990s undertook extensive studies culminating with a 1991 report which analyzed the 20 most difficult council estates.
Many of the most unpopular estates were in East London, Newcastle upon Tyne, Greater Manchester, Glasgow, the South Wales valleys, and Liverpool, their unpopularity driven by a variety of causes from the loss of key industries, population decline, and counterurbanization.
Population decline in particular was noted to be faster in inner city areas than in outer ones, however a decline was noted throughout the 1970s, through the 1990s in both inner and outer city areas.
Jobs declined between 1984 and 1991 (a decline observed particularly among men), while outer areas saw job growth (particularly among women).
The UK also saw urban areas become more ethnically diverse, however urban decline was not limited to areas which saw population changes.
Manchester in 1991 had a non-white population 7.5% higher than the national average, but Newcastle had a 1% smaller non-white population.
Features of British urban decay analyzed by the Foundation included empty houses; widespread demolitions; declining property values; and low demand for all property types, neighborhoods, and tenures.
Urban decay has been found by the Foundation to be "more extreme and therefore more visible" in the north of the United Kingdom.
This trend of northern decline has been observed not just in the United Kingdom but also in much of Europe.
Some seaside resort towns have also experienced urban decay towards the end of the 20th century.
The UK's period of urban decay was exemplified by popular songs, such as The Specials' 1981 single "Ghost Town" and The Jam's 1979 single "Down in the Tube Station at Midnight".
Large French cities are often surrounded by areas of urban decay.
While city centers tend to be occupied mainly by upper-class residents, cities are often surrounded by public housing developments, with many tenants being of North African origin (from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), and recent immigrants.
From the 1950s to the 1970s, publicly funded housing projects resulted in large areas of mid- to high-rise buildings.
These modern "grands ensembles" were welcomed at the time, as they replaced shanty towns and raised living standards, but these areas were heavily affected by economic depression in the 1980s.
The banlieues of large cities like Lyon, especially the northern Parisian banlieues, are criticized by the country's territorial spatial planning administration.
They have been ostracized since the French Commune government of 1871, considered as "lawless" or "outside the law", even "outside the Republic", as opposed to "deep France" or "authentic France", which is associated with the countryside.
In November 2005, the French suburbs were the scene of riots sparked by the accidental electrocution of two teenagers in the northern suburbs of Paris, and fueled in part by the substandard living conditions in these areas.
Many deprived suburbs of French cities were the scenes of clashes between youth and the police, with violence and numerous car burnings resulting in media coverage.
Today the situation remains generally unchanged; however, there is a level of disparity.
Some areas are experiencing increased drug trafficking, while some northern suburbs of Paris and areas like Vaulx-en-Velin are undergoing refurbishment and re-development.
Some previously mono-industrial towns in France are experiencing increasing crime, decay, and decreasing population.
The issue remains a divisive issue in French public politics.
In Italy, a well-known case of urban decay is represented by the Vele di Scampia, a large public housing estate built between 1962 and 1975 in the Scampia neighborhood of Naples.
The idea behind the project was to provide an urban housing project, where hundreds of families could socialize and create a community.
The design included a public transportation rail station, and a park area between the two buildings.
The planners wanted to create a small city model with parks, playing fields, and other facilities.
However, various events, starting with the 1980 earthquake in Irpinia, led to urban decay inside this project and in the surrounding areas.
Many families left homeless by the earthquake squatted inside the Vele.
The lack of police presence, led to a rise in Camorra drug trade, as well as other gang and illicit activity.
In South Africa, the most prominent urban decay case is Hillbrow, an inner-city neighborhood of Johannesburg which was formerly affluent.
At the end of apartheid in 1994, many middle-class white residents moved out and were replaced by mainly low-income workers and unemployed people, including many refugees and undocumented immigrants from neighboring countries.
Many businesses that operated in the area followed their customers to the suburbs, and some apartment buildings were "hi-jacked" by gangs who collected rentals from residents but failed to pay the utility bills, leading to termination of municipal services and a refusal by the legal owners to invest in maintenance or cleaning.
Occupied today by low-income residents and immigrants and being over-crowded; the proliferation of crime, drugs, illegal businesses, and decay of properties have become prevalent.
Many east German towns such as Hoyerswerda face or are facing population loss and urban shrinkage since the reunification of Germany in 1990.
Hoyerswerda's population has dropped about 40% since its peak and there is a significant lack of teenagers and
twenty- forty-some year olds due to the declining birthrates during the uncertainty of reunification.
Part of the blight in east Germany is due to the construction and preservation practices of the socialist government under the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
To fill the housing needs, the GDR quickly built many prefabricated apartment buildings.
In addition, historic preservation of pre-war buildings varied; in some cases, the rubble of buildings destroyed by the war were simply left there while in other cases the debris was removed, and an empty lot remained.
Other standing historical structures were left to decay in the early GDR as they did not represent the socialist ideals of the country.
The main responses to urban decay have been through positive public intervention and policy, through a plethora of initiatives, funding streams, and agencies, using the principles of New Urbanism (or through Urban Renaissance, its UK/European equivalent).
Gentrification has also had a significant effect, and remains the primary means of a natural remedy.
In the United States, early government policies included "urban renewal" and building of large-scale housing projects for the poor.
Urban renewal demolished entire neighborhoods in many inner cities and it was as much a cause of urban decay as a remedy.
These government efforts are now thought by many to have been misguided.
For multiple reasons including increased demand for urban amenities, some cities have rebounded from these policy mistakes.
Meanwhile, some of the inner suburbs built in the 1950s and 1960s are beginning the process of decay, as those who are living in the inner city are pushed out due to gentrification.
In Western Europe, where undeveloped land is scarce and urban areas are generally recognized as the drivers of the new information and service economies, urban renewal has become an industry in itself, with hundreds of agencies and charities set up to tackle the issue.
European cities have the benefit of historical organic development patterns already concurrent to the New Urbanist model, and although derelict, most cities have attractive historical quarters and buildings ripe for redevelopment.
In the inner-city estates and suburban cities, the solution is often more drastic, with 1960s and 1970s state housing projects being demolished and rebuilt in a more traditional European urban style, with a mix of housing types, sizes, prices, and tenures, as well as a mix of other uses such as retail or commercial.
One of the best examples of this is in Hulme, Manchester, which was cleared of 19th-century housing in the 1950s to make way for a large estate of high-rise flats.
During the 1990s, it was cleared again to make way for new development built along new urbanist lines.
A valvetrain is a mechanical system that controls the operation of the intake and exhaust valves in an internal combustion engine.
The intake valves control the flow of air/fuel mixture (or air alone for direct-injected engines) into the combustion chamber, while the exhaust valves control the flow of spent exhaust gases out of the combustion chamber once combustion is completed.
Flathead engine: The camshaft and the valves are located in the engine block below the combustion chamber.
Overhead valve engine: The camshaft remains in the block, however the valves are located in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber.
Overhead camshaft engine: The valves and camshafts are in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber.
The valvetrain consists of all the components responsible for transferring the rotational movement of the camshaft into the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves.
Typical components are listed below in order from the crankshaft to the valves.
The timing and lift profile of the valve opening events are controlled by the camshafts, through use of a carefully shaped lobe on a rotating shaft.
The camshaft is driven by the crankshaft and, in the case of a four-stroke engine, rotates at half the speed of the crankshaft.
Motion is transferred from the crankshaft to the camshaft most commonly by a rubber timing belt, a metallic timing chain or a set of gears.
Pushrods are long, slender metal rods that are used in overhead valve engines to transfer motion from the camshaft (located in the engine block) to the valves (located in the cylinder head).
The bottom end of a pushrod is fitted with a lifter, upon which the camshaft makes contact.
The camshaft lobe moves the lifter upwards, which moves the pushrod.
The top end of the pushrod pushes on the rocker arm, which opens the valve.
Depending on the design used, the valves are actuated by a rocker arm, finger, or bucket tappet.
Overhead valve engines use rocker arms, which are actuated from below indirectly (through the pushrods) by the cam lobes.
Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, which are actuated from above directly by the cam lobes.
Valve float occurs when the valve spring is unable to control the inertia of the valvetrain at high engine speeds (RPM).
A vehicle for hire is a vehicle providing private transport or shared transport for a fee, in which passengers are generally free to choose their points or approximate points of origin and destination, unlike public transport, and which they do not drive themselves, as in car rental and carsharing.
They may be offered via a ridesharing company.
Vehicles for hire include taxicabs pulled rickshaws, cycle rickshaws, auto rickshaws, motorcycle taxis, Zémidjans, okadas, boda bodas, sedan services, limousines, party buses, carriages (including hackney carriages, fiacres, and caleches), pet taxis, water taxis, and air charters.
Share taxis, paratransit, dollar vans, marshrutkas, dolmuş, nanny vans, demand responsive transport, public light buses, and airport buses operate along fixed routes, but offer some flexibility in the point of origin and/or destination.
Some of the largest vehicle for hire companies include Uber, Ola Cabs, Bolt, DiDi, and Grab.
Vanpools or vanpooling is an element of the transit system that allow groups of people to share the ride similar to a carpool, but on a larger scale with concurrent savings in fuel and vehicle operating costs and thus usually a lower cost to the rider.
Vanpools have a lower operating and capital cost than most transit vehicles in the United States, but due to their relatively low capacity, vanpools often require subsidies comparable to conventional bus service.
Vehicles may be provided by individuals, individuals in cooperation with various public and private support programs, through a program operated by or on behalf of an element of government, or a program operated by or on behalf of an employer.
The key concept is that people share the ride from home or one or more common meeting locations and travel together to a common destination or work center.
A number of programs exist (within the United States) to help lower the cost of that shared ride to the end user.
Among these are traditional funding available to public agencies, public-private partnerships, and the Best Work Places for Commuters (Commuter Choice Programs).
A tax benefit is available under 26 U.S.C. §132(f) Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefit allowances.
These public transportation programs seek to reduce the number of cars on the road (with all the attendant environmental benefits).
Speed: The van can use the HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) lanes because normally more than 2-3 people ride.
Fixed schedule (makes transit more predictable).
Saving the cost of gasoline (in some cases, it is part of the program).
Riders often can have significant reductions in the cost of personal automobile insurance (insurance for the rideshare component is usually provided as part of the vanpool program).
Incentives from local/federal transportation authorities offset cost.
In many cases, an employer may elect to subsidize the cost of the vanpool and the vehicles' maintenance.
In some cases, the vehicles are provided and maintained by the municipality; in others, they are provided in partnership with or by a third-party provider.
For example, UCLA operates an extensive network of vans in which faculty, staff, and students are eligible for discounted rates, although anyone commuting to the Westwood area is allowed to participate, with drivers receiving the highest discounts.
The vans are centrally maintained, fueled, and cleaned.
The King County Metro Vanpool Program is a successful demand responsive transport program in the Puget Sound area, specifically in King County, Washington.
Another successful program is operated by Pace in Illinois.
The oldest multi-employer vanpool program in the country is in Treasure Valley, Idaho.
For over 30 years Ada County Highway District’s Commuteride Vanpools have been crisscrossing the Valley helping commuters go to and from work, with their numerous vanpool routes traveling throughout the Treasure Valley.
The Vanpools also service the Military at Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Force Base (MHAFB) with multiple routes to and from Ada and Canyon County.
ACHD Commuteride serves the cities, Boise, Meridian, Kuna, Garden City, Eagle and Star as well as Ada County.
Another notable example is Swvl, a NASDAQ publicly held company, that is providing Vanpooling services in 18 countries.
A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people.
There is some variation in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries.
The smallest vans, microvans, are used for transporting either goods or people in tiny quantities.
Mini MPVs, compact MPVs, and MPVs are all small vans usually used for transporting people in small quantities.
Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students.
Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment.
Specially equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios.
Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages.
Van meaning a type of vehicle arose as a contraction of the word caravan.
The earliest records of a van as a vehicle in English are in the mid-19th century meaning a covered wagon for transporting goods; the earliest reported record of such was in 1829.
The words caravan with the same meaning has been used since the 1670s.
A caravan, meaning one wagon, had arisen as an extension, or corruption, of a caravan meaning a convoy of multiple wagons.
In Australian English, the term van is commonly used to describe a minivan, a passenger minibus, or an Australian panel van as manufactured by companies such as Holden and Ford at various times.
A full-size van used for commercial purposes is also known as a "van" in Australia; however, a passenger vehicle with more than seven or eight seats is more likely to be called a "minibus".
The term van can also sometimes be used interchangeably with what Australians usually call a "caravan", which in the U.S. is referred to as a "travel trailer".
The British term people mover is also used in Australian English to describe a passenger van.
The American usage of "van" which describes a cargo box trailer or semi-trailer is used rarely, if ever, in Australia.
In India, the van is one of the most common modes of transport and is often used for transporting school children to and from schools, usually when parents, especially working parents, are often too busy to pick their children up from school or when school buses are full and unable to accommodate other children.
Vans are also extensively used for commercial purposes and office cabs.
Some of the popular vans include Maruti Suzuki Omni and the Maruti Suzuki Eeco.
Early Japanese vans include the Kurogane Baby, Mazda Bongo, and the Toyota LiteAce.
The Japanese also produced many vans based on the American flat nose model, but also minivans which for the American market have generally evolved to the long-wheelbase front-wheel drive form.
The Nissan Prairie and Mitsubishi Chariot as well as microvans that fulfill kei car regulations, are popular for small businesses.
The term is also used to describe full-fledged station wagons (passenger car front sheet metal, flat-folding back seats, windows all around) and even hatchbacks with basic trim packages intended for commercial use.
These are referred to as "light vans" (Japanese: ライトバン), with "light" referring to the glazing rather than the weight of the vehicle.
In British English, the word van refers to vehicles that carry goods only, either on roads or on rails.
What would be called a "minivan" in American English is called a "people-carrier", "MPV" or multi-purpose vehicle, and larger passenger vehicles are called "minibuses".
The Telegraph newspaper introduced the idea of the "White Van Man", a typical working class man or small business owner who would have a white Ford Transit, Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, or similar panel van.
Today the phrase "man and van" refers to light removal firms normally operated by a sole business owner transporting anything from the contents of a whole house to just a few boxes.
The word "van" also refers to railway covered goods wagons, called "boxcars" in the United States.
In the United States, a van can also refer to a box-shaped trailer or semi-trailer used to carry goods.
In this case, there is a differentiation between a "dry van", used to carry most goods, and a refrigerated van, or "reefer", used for cold goods.
A railway car used to carry baggage is also called a "van".
A vehicle referred to in the US as a "full-size van" is usually a large, boxy vehicle that has a platform and powertrain similar to their light truck counterparts.
These vans may be sold with the space behind the front seats empty for transporting goods (cargo van), furnished for passenger use by either the manufacturer (wagon), or another company for more personal comforts (conversion van).
Full-size vans often have short hoods, with the engine placed under the passenger cabin.
A cutaway van chassis is a variation of the full-size van that was developed for use by second stage manufacturers.
Such a unit has a van front end and driver controls in a cab body that extends to a point behind the front seats, where the rest of the van body is cut off (leading to the terminology "cutaway").
From that point aft, only the chassis frame rails and running gear extend to the rear when the unit is shipped as an "incomplete vehicle".
A second-stage manufacturer, commonly known as a bodybuilder, will complete the vehicle for uses such as recreational vehicles, small school buses, minibusses, type III ambulances, and delivery trucks.
A large proportion of cutaway van chassis are equipped with dual rear wheels.
Second-stage manufacturers sometimes add third weight-bearing single wheel "tag axles" for their larger minibus models.
The term van in the US may also refer to a minivan.
Minivans are usually distinguished by their smaller size and front wheel drive powertrain, although some are equipped with four wheel drive.
Minivans typically offer seven- or eight-passenger seating capacity, and better fuel economy than full-sized vans, at the expense of power, cargo space, and towing capacity.
Minivans are often equipped with sliding doors.
The precursor to American vans would be the sedan deliveries of the 1930s to late-1950s.
The first generation of American vans were the 1960s compact vans, which were patterned in size after the Volkswagen Bus.
The Corvair-based entry even imitated the rear-mounted, air-cooled engine design.
The Ford Falcon-based first-generation Econoline had a flat nose, with the engine mounted between and behind the front seats.
The Dodge A100 had a similar layout and could accommodate a V8 engine.
Chevrolet also switched to this layout.
The Ford, Dodge, and Corvair vans were also produced as pickup trucks.
The standard or full size vans appeared with Ford's innovation of moving the engine forward under a short hood and using pickup truck components.
The engine cockpit housing is often called a dog house.
Over time, they evolved longer noses and sleeker shapes.
The Dodge Sportsman was available with an extension to the rear of its long-wheelbase model to create a 15-passenger van.
Vehicles have been sold as both cargo and passenger models, as well as in cutaway van chassis versions for second stage manufacturers to make box vans, ambulances, campers, and other vehicles.
Second-stage manufacturers also modify the original manufacturer's body to create custom vans.
In urban areas of the United States, full-size vans have been used as commuter vans since 1971, when Dodge introduced a van that could transport up to 15 passengers.
Commuter vans are used as an alternative to carpooling and other ride-sharing arrangements.
Many mobile businesses use a van to carry almost their entire business to various places where they work.
For example, those who come to homes or places of business to perform various services, installations, or repairs.
Vans are also used to shuttle people and their luggage between hotels and airports, to transport commuters between parking lots and their places of work, and along established routes as minibusses.
Vans are also used to transport elderly and mobility-impaired worshipers to and from church services or to transport youth groups for outings to amusement parks, picnics, and visiting other churches.
Vans are also used by schools to drive sports teams to intramural games.
Vans have been used by touring music groups to haul equipment and people to music venues around the country.
The first full-size van was the 1969 Ford Econoline, which used components from the Ford F-Series pickups.
General Motors and the Dodge Ram Van followed with designs with the engines placed farther forward, and succeeding generations of the Econoline introduced longer hoods.
Another type of van specific to North America is the step van, so named because of the design to facilitate users to step in and out of the vehicle.
Widely used by delivery services, courier companies, and the parcel division of the US Postal Service and Canada Post, they are often seen driven with the door open.
Step vans have more boxy shapes, wider bodies, and higher rooftops than other vans, and are rarely employed for carrying passengers.
The Minivan is a van which is smaller in size in length and height than a full-size van.
Minivans are often used for personal use, as well as commercial passenger operations such as taxis and shuttles, and cargo operations such as delivery of mail and packages.
They offer more cargo space than traditional sedans and SUVs.
Their lower center of gravity is also useful in handling and rollover prevention.
A van is taller than a typical passenger car, resulting in a higher center of gravity.
The suspension is also higher to accommodate the weight of 15 passengers, who can weigh over one ton alone.
In the United States, it is common for only the front seat passengers to use their safety belts.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has determined that belted passengers are about four times more likely to survive in rollover crashes.
Safety can be improved by understanding the unique characteristics of 12- and 15-passenger vans and by following guidelines developed for their drivers, according to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Many commercial vans are fitted with cargo barriers behind the front seats (or rear seats, if fitted) to prevent injuries caused by unsecured cargo in the event of sudden deceleration, collision, or a rollover.
Cargo barriers in vans are sometimes fitted with doors permitting the driver to pass through to the cargo compartment of the vehicle.
A vehicle canopy is a rarely used type of door for cars.
It has no official name so it is also known as an articulated canopy, bubble canopy, cockpit canopy, canopy door, or simply a canopy.
A canopy is a type of door which sits on top of a car and lifts up in some way, to provide access for passengers.
It is similar to an aircraft canopy.
There are no established sub-types of canopies, so they can be hinged at the front, side, or back, although hinging at the front is most common.
Canopy doors are rarely used on production cars, and are sometimes used on concept cars.
Normal car doors open out of the car's track, so they can obstruct the road or pavement when opened.
This is not an issue with canopies as they open vertically.
A-pillars are not necessary as there are no side doors, so the windscreen can extend from the front to the back of the car, giving the driver a field of vision of more than 180 degrees and minimising blind spots.
A-pillars are sometimes still added, such as in the Sterling Nova, to give the car a more conventional look.
Air-conditioning or climate control is necessary with an all-glass canopy or with a wrap-around windscreen because the canopy provides substantial 'greenhouse effect'.
In the case of a rollover accident, exiting the vehicle would be impossible, short of breaking the glass.
Entering and exiting the vehicle can be hard with a high sill and awkward roof positioning.
This problem was overcome with the Saab Aero X, which has a 3 part canopy to fully open the interior.
In situations of bad weather such as snow, rain, or hail, it is impossible to enter or exit the vehicle without getting the interior wet, unless under cover.
Significant snow accumulation may also need to be removed from the roof to make it light enough to lift.
This is not an exhaustive list.
Messerschmitt, the notable German aeroplane manufacturer, weren't allowed to produce aircraft after World War II.
Instead, they produced cars.
These were designed by the aircraft engineer Fritz Fend.
A vehicle canopy was a new concept that is believed to be invented by Messerschmitt; this originated from their aircraft design.
They quickly adopted the canopy as this was a simple solution that they had experience in.
Unlike most car canopies, the Messerschmitt canopies are hinged on the side, as was the canopy of their famous Bf 109 fighter (as was common with numerous other pre-war and wartime fighter designs).
A problem with side hinging, is that for a car with normal side-by-side seating arrangement, the passengers sitting closest to the hinge will have to climb across the outer seat to get out of the car.
For that reason the side-hinging canopy is best suited for single-occupant or tandem-seat cars, and after this, canopies were usually hinged at the front or back.
The KR175 was the first car, production or concept, to have a canopy.
In 1956, the model was changed to the Messerschmitt KR200.
The most noticeable thing about the KR200 is its distinctive bubble canopy, which gave rise to the term 'bubble car'.
The KR200 continued Messerschmitt's side-hinged canopies.
These were usually transparent acrylic ("Plexiglas" or "Perspex"), though reproductions are car-safe polymethyl methacrylate.
The first of 3 concept cars made under the Alfa Romeo Scarabeo name was equipped with a forward hinged canopy.
The 1969 Holden Hurricane concept car features a canopy door.
The Ferrari 512 S Modulo concept car, designed by Pininfarina, features a canopy door.
The Bond Bug is a small 3-wheeled sports car and was the first production car to use a front-hinged canopy.
Other than the Purvis Eureka (a licensed copy of the Nova) and the Bond Bug, the Nova is the only production car to date to use a front-hinged canopy door.
The windscreen has small A-pillars so it looks like a conventional car when the canopy is closed.
The 1985 Buick Wildcat concept car had a canopy.
The style of canopy used was an extended canopy, composed of much of the front bodywork, and not just the passenger compartment.
A canopy was used in this concept car as it was thought to be futuristic.
The concept Volkswagen 1-litre car, the VW 1L, uses a canopy door.
The 2013 production version of the concept used butterfly doors.
The Maserati Birdcage 75th lacks conventional doors, instead using an extended canopy system.
The demonstrator model lacks air-conditioning and so journalists (including Evo Magazine's Harry Metcalfe) experienced the previously-mentioned 'glasshouse effect': whilst driving the vehicle they were reportedly forced to keep the bubble slightly open on hot days to cool the car's interior.
The Aero X's top canopy is styled on the one of the Saab aeroplanes, and this was their inspiration for using a canopy.
The canopy opens by remote control, and there is a lever to close it again.
The three-piece canopy eliminates the problems like a high sill and awkwardly angled roof, although the mechanisms are more complex and so heavier, and more likely to fail; leaving an occupant stranded inside a car.
The canopy includes a wrap-around windscreen and a glass roof, side windows and body panels (which lift upwards, lowering the sills), and the top roof section of the interior fascia (which moves inwards so it doesn't obstruct entry/exit).
These sections intricately manoeuvre themselves into a position where they take up as little space as possible.
This construction eliminates the need for doors and A-pillars and so the windscreen extends from B-pillar to B-pillar, which has the important benefit of improving overall visibility.
In October 2018, Human Horizons, the mother company of the HiPhi NEV brand revealed the Concept H, alongside the Concept A. The H is for Hypervelocity, and the concept features a set of butterfly doors with an additional canopy opening which the company calls the A.C.E.S. or Articulated Cabin Entry System, which moves part of the roof to make access easier.
The idea was later transferred to the HiPhi X production car in the form of gull wing doors or what the company calls the NT door.
Various models of the Batmobile used in the production of the Batman films make use of the canopy door.
Bubble canopies are popular on some custom cars, most notably those by Ed Roth, such as the Orbitron, Road Agent and Beatnik Bandit.
The Lamborghini Egoista, the company's 50th anniversary celebration car, has a canopy door.
It is designed to look like a fighter jet.
The Lamborghini Terzo Millennio, a futuristic electric concept car introduced by Lamborghini and developed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) also has a canopy door.
The action-roleplay video game expansion Cyberpunk 2077:
Phantom Liberty features the Herrera Riptide, a retro-futuristic sports coupe vehicle that has a canopy door.
Vehicle glass is generally held in place by glass run channels, which also serve to contain fragments of glass if the glass breaks.
Vehicle glass may contain heating coils or antennae.
Windscreen repair requires clearing the impact area and removing air through vacuum creation.
A transparent fluid is used to fill the crack.
The fluid is than treated with UV light to chemically solidify the fluid.
Professional repairs can achieve clarity up to 95% with complete structural integrity.
US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 212/208 ensures reliability of adhesives used in US vehicles.
For a bonded glass, replacement can take up to an hour.
Time must be allowed to allow the adhesive to cure.
This is known as "Safe Drive Away Time" or "Minimum Drive Away Time".
A vanity plate or personalized plate (United States and Canada); prestige plate, private number plate, cherished plate or personalised registration (United Kingdom); personalised plate (Australia, New Zealand, and United Kingdom) or custom plate (Canada, Australia and New Zealand) is a special type of vehicle registration plate on an automobile or other vehicle.
The owner of the vehicle pays extra money to have their own choice of numbers or letters, usually portraying a recognizable phrase, slogan, or abbreviation, on their plate.
Sales of vanity plates are often a significant source of revenue for North American provincial and state licensing agencies.
In some jurisdictions, such as British Columbia, vanity plates have a different color scheme and design.
Vanity plates are issued by every U.S. state and the District of Columbia, and every Canadian province except Newfoundland and Labrador.
In 2007, the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) and Stefan Lonce, author of License to Roam: Vanity License Plates and the Stories They Tell, conducted North America's first state by state and province by province survey of vanity plates, revealing that there are 9.7 million vehicles with personalized vanity license plates.
The survey ranked jurisdictions by "vanity plate penetration rate", which is the percentage of registered motor vehicles that are vanitized.
Virginia has the highest U.S. vanity plate penetration rate (16.19%), followed by New Hampshire (13.99%), Illinois (13.41%), Nevada (12.73%), Montana (9.8%), Maine (9.7%), Connecticut (8.14%), New Jersey (6.8%), North Dakota (6.5%) and Vermont (6.1%).
Texas had the lowest vanity plate penetration rate (0.5%).
Virginia's high rate of vanity plates, in particular, was attributed to the low cost per annum compared to a standard plate: the state charges $10 more for vanity plates than for state-issued plates, compared to $50 more in Maryland and Texas, and $100 more in Washington, D.C.
According to the Federal Highway Administration, in 2005 there were 242,991,747 privately owned and commercial registered automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles in the U.S., and 3.83% of eligible U.S. vehicles have vanity plates.
Ontario had the highest Canadian vanity plate penetration rate (4.59%), followed by Saskatchewan (2.69%), Manitoba (1.96%), the Yukon (1.79%), and the Northwest Territories (1.75%).
British Columbia had the lowest vanity plate penetration rate (0.59%) among those provinces that issue vanity plates.
According to Statistics Canada, in 2006 there were 14,980,046 registered motor vehicles (excluding buses, trailers, and off-road, farm and construction vehicles) in the provinces and territories that issue vanity plates, and 2.94% of eligible Canadian vehicles have vanity plates.
In some states and provinces, optional plates can also be vanity plates and are a choice of motorists who want a more distinctive personalised plate.
However, the maximum number of characters on an optional plate may be lower than on a standard-issue plate.
For example, the U.S. state of Virginia allows up to 7.5 characters (a space or hyphen is counted as 0.5 character) on a standard-issue plate, but only up to 6 characters on many of its optional plates.
In some states, a motorist may also check the availability of a desired combination online.
In New Jersey, which uses six alphanumeric characters on its plates, drivers can order vanity plates with seven characters.
All U.S. states and Canadian provinces that issue vanity plates have a "blue list" of vanity plates that contains banned words, phrases, or letter/number combinations.
The U.S. state of Florida, for example, has banned such plates as "PIMPALA", while the state of New York bans any plates with the letters "FDNY", "NYPD", or "GOD", among others.
Often the ban is to eliminate confusion with plates used on governmental vehicles or plates used on other classes of vehicles.
However, a licensing authority's discretion to deny or revoke "offensive" vanity plates is finite, as some U.S. motorists have successfully sued their state governments on that issue under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The "blue list" is not definitive; in general, the agent processing an application for a vanity plate can reject a plate if it is deemed offensive, even if the phrase does not match a banned word exactly.
State DMVs have received complaints about offensive vanity plates.
In this case, the DMV can revoke a plate if it is deemed offensive, even if it had been previously approved.
The "blue list" may be limited to genuine vanity plates, not covering computer-generated accidents.
For example, Florida's famous "A55 RGY" license plate (with the standard drawing of an orange in the middle) looks like "ASS ORGY".
The state of Georgia banned the word "covfefe", a misspelling of the word "coverage" that was coined by U.S. President Donald Trump on his Twitter to its customized plates.
In the United Kingdom, number plates are issued by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
They do not approve personalised registrations (often also called private number plates and cherished number plates in the UK) if they contain words which are offensive in any widely used language.
One registration to slip the net was PEN 15.
The DVLA however lately have released more and more previously banned combinations such as SEX and DAM.
UK plates have to match certain very strict letter/number combinations: see vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom.
Registrations can be sold, or transferred from one vehicle to another, with some restrictions.
Registrations can also be held on a retention document issued by the DVLA, this is perfect for dealers or if the owner is in between vehicles.
Only the registered owner/registered keeper of the vehicle can be awarded the V778 Retention Document when making an online application.
However, the V317 form (postal application) allows the number to be retained in someone else’s name (allocating them as new Grantee) on the issued V778 retention document so the seller can transfer the plate to whoever is receiving the private number plate.
Usually the Cherished Number Agent handling the sale will arrange all this for the seller making it hassle free.
The trade of number plates was started by private dealers, entrepreneurs who saw an opportunity to sell something in demand.
Originally, the only vanity plates allowed to be transferred were ordinary registrations that had been transferred.
The DVLA began selling personalised registrations unrelated to the registration districts in 1989.
More than 4.2 million registrations were sold during the first 25 years of this initiative, raising over £2 billion for the UK Treasury.
There is some additional flexibility available by using numbers that resemble letters (e.g., S for 5), or by using large black, yellow or white headed screws to fix the plate to the car to fill in or create a gap (e.g. in the middle of 'H' to make it look like two 1s or Is).
However, the font style, size and spacing is mandated by law, making the practice illegal.
The font that is used on all new number plates is the Charles Wright 2001 version of the Mandatory typeface, and was first introduced in September 2001 to coincide with the DVLA release of new style DVLA number plates.
In Australia the various states offer personalised plate schemes, with some states having a yearly fee to maintain the cherished number.
In the Australian states of Victoria and Queensland the proceeds from the sale of custom plates and personalised plates go towards road safety activities.
As of 2022, Austria, Andorra, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Iceland, Sweden, South Africa, and Eswatini also allow such license plates.
Additionally, Turkey allows for one to pay to add a blue section to their plate to display personalized text, however this isn't considered part of the plate number.
German car registration law does not allow license plates such as these, but it is possible to select the two letters after the district designation and up to four numbers thereafter for a small fee.
It is common in Germany for car owners to register license plates with their initials and a year or number of significance to them.
For example, a man by the name of Jimmy Wales living in Berlin and born in 1966 might opt to register B–JW 1966, providing it is still available, Japan and Brazil have a similar system.
On November 19, 2007, Dutch Member of Parliament Paul de Krom proposed that vanity plates be introduced in the Netherlands as well, after having seen them while visiting the United States.
One barrier his proposal would have to overcome would be that the RDW (Netherlands Vehicle Authority) links license plates to the actual cars as opposed to their owners.
Additionally, vowels are not allowed on Dutch license plates specifically because otherwise license plates could (unintentionally) spell a word, so allowing vanity plates would be a strange match with current law.
On 25 January 2024, the PVV again proposed that vanity plates may be introduced in the country as well.
The vanity plate idea comes closer and closer in the Netherlands.
In Poland, there is an option to buy an individual number plate for an extra charge.
The plate looks the same as an ordinary one, there is a letter showing the country district, then one number and then up to five letters of free choice.
In the United Arab Emirates, regular number plates consist of five digits and one optional character (depending on the emirate).
So-called "distinguished plates" have a special combination of digits (12345, 55555, etc.) or less than five digits and are sold at public auctions, the profit of which is used for charities.
Very low numbers fetch very high prices, the record being the number one plate from Abu Dhabi, sold for 52.2 million Dirhams (US$14 million).
In Dubai, plate number one (without additional letter) is registered to the car of Sheikh Mohammed, ruler of Dubai.
On June 15, 2017, it became possible to apply for a personalized license plate in Norway.
The person registering the plate must complete an online application and pay a fee of 9000 Norwegian kroner (about US$1058).
If the license plate is considered appropriate and the application is approved by an employee, the applicant will have to pay the fee within a certain time limit.
If the fee is not paid, the application is denied and the sign goes back into the pool and can be reserved by others.
The service was reportedly so popular that the government's Public Roads website crashed within minutes of launch.
The Czech Republic has allowed request plates since January 2016.
While standard plates for automobiles, trucks, buses or trailers have 7 characters (grouped 3+4), request plates have 8 characters (3+5).
For motorcycles, a standard plate has 6 characters (2+4), a request plate 7 characters (2+5).
The whole string has to contain at least one digit.
Plates must not contain vulgar or defamatory expressions, nor names of authority offices.
As with the standard plates, they cannot contain the letters G, O, Q, or W. A single plate costs a CZK 5000 charge, the whole pair CZK 10000 charge, preliminary reservation CZK 500 up to 3 months.
When the plate is lost or stolen, a duplicate cannot be emitted.
Urban sprawl (also known as suburban sprawl or urban encroachment) is defined as "the spreading of urban developments (such as houses, dense multi family apartments, office buildings and shopping centers) on undeveloped land near a more or less densely populated city".
Urban sprawl has been described as the unrestricted growth in many urban areas of housing, commercial development, and roads over large expanses of land, with little concern for very dense urban planning.
Sometimes the  urban areas described as the most "sprawling" are the most densely populated.
In addition to describing a special form of urbanization, the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development.
In modern times some suburban areas described as "sprawl" have less detached housing and higher density than the nearby core city.
Medieval suburbs suffered from the loss of protection of city walls, before the advent of industrial warfare.
Modern disadvantages and costs include increased travel time, transport costs, pollution, and destruction of the countryside.
The revenue for building and maintaining urban infrastructure in these areas are  gained mostly through property and sales taxes.
Most jobs in the US are now located in suburbs generating much of the revenue, although a lack of growth will require higher tax rates.
In Europe, the term peri-urbanisation is often used to denote similar dynamics and phenomena, but the term urban sprawl is currently being used by the European Environment Agency.
There is widespread disagreement about what constitutes sprawl and how to quantify it.
For example, some commentators measure sprawl by residential density, using the average number of residential units per acre in a given area.
Others associate it with decentralization (spread of population without a well-defined centre), discontinuity (leapfrogging development, as defined below), segregation of uses, and so forth.
The term urban sprawl is highly politicized and almost always has negative connotations.
It is criticized for causing environmental degradation, intensifying segregation, and undermining the vitality of existing urban areas, and is attacked on aesthetic grounds.
The pejorative meaning of the term means that few openly support urban sprawl as such.
The term has become a rallying cry for managing urban growth.
The term urban sprawl was often used in the letters between Lewis Mumford and Frederic J. Osborn, firstly by Osborn in his 1941 letter to Mumford and later by Mumford, generally condemning the waste of agricultural land and landscape due to suburban expansions.
The term was used in an article in The Times in 1955 as a negative comment on the state of London's outskirts.
Definitions of sprawl vary; researchers in the field acknowledge that the term lacks precision.
Batty et al. defined sprawl as "uncoordinated growth: the expansion of community without concern for its consequences, in short, unplanned, incremental urban growth which is often regarded unsustainable".
Bhatta et al. wrote in 2010 that despite a dispute over the precise definition of sprawl, there is a "general consensus that urban sprawl is characterized by [an] unplanned and uneven pattern of growth, driven by a multitude of processes and leading to inefficient resource utilization".
Reid Ewing has shown that sprawl has typically been characterized as urban developments exhibiting at least one of the following characteristics: low-density or single-use development, strip development, scattered development, and/or leapfrog development (areas of development interspersed with vacant land).
He argued that a better way to identify sprawl was to use indicators rather than characteristics because this was a more flexible and less arbitrary method.
He proposed using "accessibility" and "functional open space" as indicators.
Ewing's approach has been criticized for assuming that sprawl is defined by negative characteristics.
What constitutes sprawl may be considered a matter of degree and will always be somewhat subjective under many definitions of the term.
Ewing has also argued that suburban development does not, per se, constitute sprawl depending on the form it takes, although Gordon & Richardson have argued that the term is sometimes used synonymously with suburbanization in a pejorative way.
According to the National Resources Inventory (NRI), about 44 million acres (69,000 sq mi; 180,000 km2) of land in the United States was developed between 1982 and 2017.
Presently, the NRI classifies approximately 100,000 more square kilometres (40,000 square miles) (an area approximately the size of Kentucky) as developed than the Census Bureau classifies as urban.
The difference in the NRI classification is that it includes rural development, which by definition cannot be considered to be "urban" sprawl.
Currently, according to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.6 percent of the U.S. land area is urban.
Approximately 0.8 percent of the nation's land is in the 37 urbanized areas with more than 1,000,000 population.
In 2002, these 37 urbanized areas supported around 40% of the total American population.
Nonetheless, some urban areas like Detroit have expanded geographically even while losing population.
But it was not just urbanized areas in the U.S. that lost population and sprawled substantially.
According to data in "Cities and Automobile Dependence" by Kenworthy and Laube (1999), urbanized area population losses occurred while there was an expansion of sprawl between 1970 and 1990 in Amsterdam, Netherlands; Brussels, Belgium; Copenhagen, Denmark; Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich, Germany; and Zürich, Switzerland, albeit without the dismantling of infrastructure that occurred in the United States.
Despite popular notions of being a sprawling city, Metropolitan Los Angeles is the densest major urban area (over 1,000,000 population) in the US, being denser than the New York urban area and the San Francisco urban area.
Most of metropolitan Los Angeles is built at more uniform low to moderate density, leading to a much higher overall density for the entire region.
This is in contrast to New York, San Francisco or Chicago which have compact, high-density cores surrounded by areas of very low-density suburban periphery, such as eastern Suffolk County in the New York metro area and Marin County in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Some cases of sprawl challenge the definition of the term and what conditions are necessary for urban growth to be considered sprawl.
Metropolitan regions such as Greater Mexico City, Delhi National Capital Region Beijing, and the Greater Tokyo Area are often regarded as sprawling despite being relatively dense and mixed use.
Many theories speculate as to the reason for the creation of urban sprawl.
The theory of "flight from blight" explains that aspects of living in urban areas, such as high taxes, crime rates, poor infrastructure and school qualities lead to many people moving out of urban areas and into surrounding suburban areas.
According to The Limits to Growth, reasons why wealthier people move to suburbs include noise, pollution, crime, drug addiction, poverty, labor strikes, and breakdown of social services.
Others suggest that Urban Sprawl is a natural product of population increases, higher wages, and therefore better access to housing.
Improvement in transportation also means that individuals are able to live further from large cities and industrial hubs, thus increasing demand for better housing further from the noise of cities.
This leads to the creation of sprawling residential land development surrounding densely packed urban areas.
Despite the lack of a clear agreed upon description of what defines sprawl most definitions often associate the following characteristics with sprawl.
This refers to a situation where commercial, residential, institutional and industrial areas are separated from one another.
Consequently, large tracts of land are devoted to a single use and are segregated from one another by open space, infrastructure, or other barriers.
As a result, the places where people live, work, shop, and recreate are far from one another, usually to the extent that walking, transit use and bicycling are impractical, so all these activities generally require a car.
The degree to which different land uses are mixed together is often used as an indicator of sprawl in studies of the subject.
According to this criterion, China's urbanization can be classified as "high-density sprawl", a seemingly self-contradictory term coined by New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe.
He explains that despite the high-rise buildings, China's superblocks (huge residential blocks) are largely single-use and surrounded by giant arterial roads, which detach different functions of a city and create an environment unfriendly to pedestrians.
Job sprawl is another land use symptom of urban sprawl and car-dependent communities.
It is defined as low-density, geographically spread-out patterns of employment, where the majority of jobs in a given metropolitan area are located outside of the main city's central business district (CBD), and increasingly in the suburban periphery.
It is often the result of urban disinvestment, the geographic freedom of employment location allowed by predominantly car-dependent commuting patterns of many American suburbs, and many companies' desire to locate in low-density areas that are often more affordable and offer potential for expansion.
Spatial mismatch is related to job sprawl and economic environmental justice.
Spatial mismatch is defined as the situation where poor urban, predominantly minority citizens are left without easy access to entry-level jobs, as a result of increasing job sprawl and limited transportation options to facilitate a reverse commute to the suburbs.
Job sprawl has been documented and measured in various ways.
It has been shown to be a growing trend in America's metropolitan areas.
The Brookings Institution has published multiple articles on the topic.
In 2005, author Michael Stoll defined job sprawl simply as jobs located more than 5-mile (8.0 km) radius from the CBD, and measured the concept based on year 2000 U.S. Census data.
Other ways of measuring the concept with more detailed rings around the CBD include a 2001 article by Edward Glaeser and Elizabeth Kneebone's 2009 article, which show that sprawling urban peripheries are gaining employment while areas closer to the CBD are losing jobs.
These two authors used three geographic rings limited to a 35-mile (56 km) radius around the CBD: 3 miles (4.8 km) or less, 3 to 10 miles (16 km), and 10 to 35 miles (56 km).
Kneebone's study showed the following nationwide breakdown for the largest metropolitan areas in 2006: 21.3% of jobs located in the inner ring, 33.6% of jobs in the 3–10 mile ring, and 45.1% in the 10–35 mile ring.
This compares to the year 1998 – 23.3%, 34.2%, and 42.5% in those respective rings.
The study shows CBD employment share shrinking, and job growth focused in the suburban and exurban outer metropolitan rings.
Sprawl often refers to low-density development.
There is no precise definition of "low density", but it might commonly mean Single-family homes on large lots.
Such buildings usually have fewer stories and are spaced farther apart, separated by lawns, landscaping, roads or parking lots.
In the United States 2–4 houses per acre (5–10 per hectare) might be considered low-density while in the UK 8–12 per acre (or 20–30 per hectare) would still be considered low-density.
Because more automobiles are used in the USA, much more land is designated for parking.
The impact of low density development in many communities is that developed or "urbanized" land is increasing at a faster rate than the population is growing.
Overall density is often lowered by "leapfrog development".
This term refers to the relationship, or lack of it, between subdivisions.
Such developments are typically separated by large green belts, i.e. tracts of undeveloped land, resulting in an overall density far lower even than the low density indicated by localized per-acre measurements.
This is a 20th and 21st century phenomenon generated by the current custom of requiring a developer to provide subdivision infrastructure as a condition of development.
Usually, the developer is required to set aside a certain percentage of the developed land for public use, including roads, parks and schools.
In the past, when a local government built all the streets in a given location, the town could expand without interruption and with a coherent circulation system, because it had condemnation power.
Private developers generally do not have such power (although they can sometimes find local governments willing to help), and often choose to develop on the tracts that happen to be for sale at the time they want to build, rather than pay extra or wait for a more appropriate location.
Some research argues that religious ideas about how humans should live (and die) promote low-density development and may contribute to urban sprawl.
Land for sprawl is often taken from fertile agricultural lands, which are often located immediately surrounding cities; the extent of modern sprawl has consumed a large amount of the most productive agricultural land, as well as forest, desert and other wilderness areas.
In the United States the seller may avoid tax on profit by using a tax break exempting like-kind exchanges from capital gains tax; proceeds from the sale are used to purchase agricultural land elsewhere and the transaction is treated as a "swap" or trade of like assets and no tax is due.
Thus urban sprawl is subsidized by the tax code.
In China, land has been converted from rural to urban use in advance of demand, leading to vacant rural land intended for future development, and eventual urban sprawl.
Housing subdivisions are large tracts of land consisting entirely of newly built residences.
New Urbanist architectural firm Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company state that housing subdivisions "are sometimes called villages, towns, and neighbourhoods by their developers, which is misleading since those terms denote places that are not exclusively residential".
They are also referred to as developments.
Subdivisions often incorporate curved roads and cul-de-sacs.
These subdivisions may offer only a few places to enter and exit the development, causing traffic to use high volume collector streets.
All trips, no matter how short, must enter the collector road in a suburban system.
After the Second World War, residential lawns became commonplace in suburbs, notably, but not exclusively in North America.
The development of country clubs and golf courses in the early 20th century further promoted lawn culture in the United States.
Lawns now take up a significant amount of land in suburban developments, contributing to sprawl.
In areas of sprawl, commercial use is generally segregated from other uses.
In the U.S. and Canada, these often take the form of strip malls, which refer to collections of buildings sharing a common parking lot, usually built on a high-capacity roadway with commercial functions (i.e., a "strip").
Similar developments in the United Kingdom are called Retail Parks.
Strip malls consisting mostly of big box stores or category killers are sometimes called "power centers" (U.S.).
These developments tend to be low-density; the buildings are single-story and there is ample space for parking and access for delivery vehicles.
This character is reflected in the spacious landscaping of the parking lots and walkways and clear signage of the retail establishments.
Some strip malls are undergoing a transformation into Lifestyle centers; entailing investments in common areas and facilities (plazas, cafes) and shifting tenancy from daily goods to recreational shopping.
Another prominent form of retail development in areas characterized by sprawl is the shopping mall.
Unlike the strip mall, this is usually composed of a single building surrounded by a parking lot that contains multiple shops, usually "anchored" by one or more department stores.
The function and size is also distinct from the strip mall.
The focus is almost exclusively on recreational shopping rather than daily goods.
Shopping malls also tend to serve a wider (regional) public and require higher-order infrastructure such as highway access and can have floorspaces in excess of 1 million sq ft (93,000 m2).
Shopping malls are often detrimental to downtown shopping centres of nearby cities since the shopping malls act as a surrogate for the city centre.
Some downtowns have responded to this challenge by building shopping centres of their own.
Fast food chains are often built early in areas with low property values where the population is expected to boom and where large traffic is predicted, and set a precedent for future development.
Eric Schlosser, in his book Fast Food Nation, argues that fast food chains accelerate suburban sprawl and help set its tone with their expansive parking lots, flashy signs, and plastic architecture (65).
Duany Plater Zyberk & Company believe that this reinforces a destructive pattern of growth in an endless quest to move away from the sprawl that only results in creating more of it.
Urban sprawl is associated with a number of negative environmental outcomes.
One of the major environmental problems associated with sprawl is land consumption, habitat loss and subsequent reduction in biodiversity.
A review by Czech and colleagues finds that urbanization endangers more species and is more geographically ubiquitous in the mainland United States than any other human activity.
Urban sprawl is disruptive to native flora & fauna and introduces invasive plants into their environments.
Although the effects can be mitigated through careful maintenance of native vegetation, the process of ecological succession and public education, sprawl represents one of the primary threats to biodiversity.
Regions with high birth rates and immigration are therefore faced with environmental problems due to unplanned urban growth and emerging megacities such as Kolkata.
At the same time, the urban cores of these and nearly all other major cities in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan that did not annex new territory experienced the related phenomena of falling household size and, particularly in the U.S., "white flight", sustaining population losses.
This trend has slowed somewhat in recent years, as more people have regained an interest in urban living.
Due to the larger area consumed by sprawling suburbs compared to urban neighborhoods, more farmland and wildlife habitats are displaced per resident.
As forest cover is cleared and covered with impervious surfaces (concrete and asphalt) in the suburbs, rainfall is less effectively absorbed into the groundwater aquifers.
This threatens both the quality and quantity of water supplies.
Sprawl increases water pollution as rain water picks up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, and other pollutants in runoff from parking lots and roads.
Gordon & Richardson have argued that the conversion of agricultural land to urban use is not a problem due to the increasing efficiency of agricultural production; they argue that aggregate agricultural production is still more than sufficient to meet global food needs despite the expansion of urban land use.
Sprawl leads to increased driving, which in turn leads to vehicle emissions that contribute to air pollution and its attendant negative impacts on human health.
In addition, the reduced physical activity implied by increased automobile use has negative health consequences.
Sprawl significantly predicts chronic medical conditions and health-related quality of life, but not mental health disorders.
The American Journal of Public Health and the American Journal of Health Promotion, have both stated that there is a significant connection between sprawl, obesity, and hypertension.
Loud vehicles can cause stress, prevent sleep, and minimize social interactions in public for people living in cities (especially homeless people).
In the years following World War II, when vehicle ownership was becoming widespread, public health officials recommended the health benefits of suburbs due to soot and industrial fumes in the city center.
However, air in modern suburbs is not necessarily cleaner than air in urban neighborhoods.
In fact, the most polluted air is on crowded highways, where people in suburbs tend to spend more time.
On average, suburban residents generate more per capita pollution and carbon emissions than their urban counterparts because of their increased driving, as well as larger homes.
Sprawl also reduces the chance that people will take the bicycle for their commute which would be better for their health.
Bicycles are a common mode of transportation for those living in urban centers due to many factors.
One major factor many people consider relates to how, when one rides a bike to, say, their workplace, they are exercising as they do so.
This multi-tasking is better for one's health than automatic transport.
A heavy reliance on automobiles increases traffic throughout the city as well as automobile crashes, pedestrian injuries, and air pollution.
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of five and twenty-four and is the leading accident-related cause for all age groups.
Residents of more sprawling areas are generally at greater risk of dying in a car crash due to increased exposure to driving.
Evidence indicates that pedestrians in sprawling areas are at higher risk than those in denser areas, although the relationship is less clear than for drivers and passengers in vehicles.
Research covered in the Journal of Economic Issues and State and Local Government Review shows a link between sprawl and emergency medical services response and fire department response delays.
Living in larger, more spread out spaces generally makes public services more expensive.
Since car usage becomes endemic and public transport often becomes significantly more expensive, city planners are forced to build highway and parking infrastructure, which in turn decreases taxable land and revenue, and decreases the desirability of the area adjacent to such structures.
Providing services such as water, sewers, road maintenance, and electricity is also more expensive per household in less dense areas, given that sprawl increases lengths of power lines, roads, and pipes, necessitating higher maintenance costs.
Residents of low-density areas spend a higher proportion of their income on transportation than residents of high density areas.
The unplanned nature of outward urban development is commonly linked to increased dependency on cars.
In 2003, a British newspaper calculated that urban sprawl would cause an economic loss of £3,905 per year, per person through cars alone, based on data from the RAC estimating that the average cost of operating a car in the UK at that time was £5,000 a year, while train travel (assuming a citizen commutes every day of the year, with a ticket cost of 3 pounds) would be only £1,095.
Additionally, increased density increases the supply of housing in desirable areas, and thus, it also decreases housing prices in those areas (by the logic of supply and demand).
Urban sprawl may be partly responsible for the decline in social capital in the United States.
Compact neighborhoods can foster casual social interactions among neighbors, while sprawl creates barriers.
Sprawl tends to replace public spaces with private spaces such as fenced-in backyards.
Critics of sprawl maintain that sprawl erodes quality of life.
Duany and Plater-Zyberk believe that in traditional neighborhoods the nearness of the workplace to retail and restaurant space that provides cafes and convenience stores with daytime customers is an essential component to the successful balance of urban life.
Furthermore, they state that the closeness of the workplace to homes also gives people the option of walking or riding a bicycle to work or school and that without this kind of interaction between the different components of life the urban pattern quickly falls apart.
James Howard Kunstler has argued that poor aesthetics in suburban environments make them "places not worth caring about", and that they lack a sense of history and identity.
Urban sprawl has class and racial implications in many parts of the world; the relative homogeneity of many sprawl developments may reinforce class and racial divides through residential segregation.
Numerous studies link increased population density with increased aggression.
Some people believe that increased population density encourages crime and anti-social behavior.
It is argued that human beings, while social animals, need significant amounts of social space or they become agitated and aggressive.
However, the relationship between higher densities and increased social pathology has been largely discredited.
According to Nancy Chin, a large number of effects of sprawl have been discussed in the academic literature in some detail; however, the most contentious issues can be reduced "to an older set of arguments, between those advocating a planning approach and those advocating the efficiency of the market".
Those who criticize sprawl tend to argue that sprawl creates more problems than it solves and should be more heavily regulated, while proponents argue that markets are producing the economically most efficient settlements possible in most situations, even if problems may exist.
However, some market-oriented commentators believe that the current patterns of sprawl are in fact the result of distortions of the free market.
Chin cautions that there is a lack of "reliable empirical evidence to support the arguments made either for or against sprawl".
She mentions that the lack of a common definition, the need for more quantitative measures "a broader view both in time and space, and greater comparison with alternative urban forms" would be necessary to draw firmer conclusions and conduct more fruitful debates.
Arguments opposing urban sprawl include concrete effects such as health and environmental issues as well as abstract consequences including neighborhood vitality.
American public policy analyst Randal O'Toole of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, has argued that sprawl, thanks to the automobile, gave rise to affordable suburban neighborhoods for middle class and lower class individuals, including non-whites.
He notes that efforts to combat sprawl often result in subsidizing development in wealthier and whiter neighborhoods while condemning and demolishing poorer minority neighborhoods.
The American Institute of Architects, American Planning Association, and Smart Growth America recommend against sprawl and instead endorses smart, mixed-use development, including buildings in close proximity to one another that cut down on automobile use, save energy, and promote walkable, healthy, well-designed neighborhoods.
The Sierra Club, the San Francisco Bay Area's Greenbelt Alliance, 1000 Friends of Oregon and counterpart organizations nationwide, and other environmental organizations oppose sprawl and support investment in existing communities.
NumbersUSA, a national organization advocating immigration reduction, also opposes urban sprawl, and its founder, Roy Beck, specializes in the study of this issue.
The principle of consumer sovereignty has played a powerful role in the increase in America’s wealth and in the welfare of its citizens.
Producers (including developers) have responded rapidly to households’ demands.
It is a giant step backward to interfere with this effective process unless the benefits of intervention substantially exceed its cost.
They argue that sprawl generates enough benefits for consumers that they continue to choose it as a form of development over alternative forms, as demonstrated by the continued focus on sprawl type developments by most developers.
However, other academics such as Reid Ewing argue that while a large segment of people prefer suburban living that does not mean that sprawl itself is preferred by consumers, and that a large variety of suburban environments satisfy consumer demand, including areas that mitigate the worst effects of sprawl.
Others, for example Kenneth T. Jackson have argued that since low-density housing is often (notably in the U.S.) subsidized in a variety of ways, consumers' professed preferences for this type of living may be over-stated.
Whether urban sprawl increases the problems of automobile dependency or not, policies of smart growth have been fiercely contested issues over several decades.
An influential study in 1989 by Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia.
The study has been criticised for its methodology, but the main finding, that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted, although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.
Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas.
This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income.
This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however.
One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport.
Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behavior.
More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behavior, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.
Those not opposed to low density development argue that traffic intensities tend to be less, traffic speeds faster and, as a result, ambient air pollution is lower.
(See demographia's report.)
Kansas City, Missouri is often cited as an example of ideal low-density development, with congestion below the mean and home prices below comparable Midwestern cities.
Wendell Cox and Randal O'Toole are leading figures supporting lower density development.
Longitudinal (time-lapse) studies of commute times in major metropolitan areas in the United States have shown that commute times decreased for the period 1969 to 1995 even though the geographic size of the city increased.
Other studies suggest, however, that possible personal benefits from commute time savings have been at the expense of environmental costs in the form of longer average commute distances, rising vehicles-miles-traveled (VMT) per worker, and despite road expansions, worsening traffic congestion.
Critics of urban sprawl say that the United States' improper treatment of minority groups' access to transportation is a major downside to the continuation of urban sprawl.
In many urban centers, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, transportation in minority areas is lacking.
As found by Kate Baldridge of Golden Gate University Law, areas with high minority populations typically see less than adequate transportation options, leading to overcrowded and unsafe transportation routes that do not provide a comprehensive means of transportation.
This disparity is made more evident because minority residents are more reliant on public transportation.
According to Baldridge, this means that minority groups cannot move from urban areas, while people with higher incomes and thus better access to transportation can move out of urban areas and into surrounding suburbs.
Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour Melia et al.
(2011) found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of smart growth measures to counteract urban sprawl.
Planning policies that increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.
Ceteris paribus, urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs.
There is also some concern that anti-sprawl policies will increase housing prices.
Some research suggests Oregon has had the largest housing affordability loss in the nation, but other research shows that Portland's price increases are comparable to other Western cities.
In Australia, it is claimed by some that housing affordability has hit "crisis levels" due to "urban consolidation" policies implemented by state governments.
In Sydney, the ratio of the price of a house relative to income is 9:1.
The issue has at times been debated between the major political parties.
Many critics concede that sprawl produces some negative externalities; however there is some dispute about the most effective way to reduce these negative effects.
Gordon & Richardson for example argue that the costs of building new public transit is disproportionate to the actual environmental or economic benefits, that land use restrictions will increase the cost of housing and restrict economic opportunity, that infill possibilities are too limited to make a major difference to the structure of American cities, and that the government would need to coerce most people to live in a way that they do not want to in order to substantially change the impact of sprawl.
They argue that the property market should be deregulated to allow different people to live as they wish, while providing a framework of market based fees (such as emission fees, congestion charging or road pricing) to mitigate many of the problems associated with sprawl such as congestion and increased pollution.
Starting in the early 20th century, environmentalist opposition to urban sprawl began to coalesce, with roots in the garden city movement, as well as pressure from campaign groups such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE).
Under Herbert Morrison's 1934 leadership of the London County Council, the first formal proposal was made by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee "to provide a reserve supply of public open spaces and of recreational areas and to establish a green belt or girdle of open space".
It was again included in an advisory Greater London Plan prepared by Patrick Abercrombie in 1944.
The Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 expressly incorporated green belts into all further national urban developments.
New provisions for compensation in the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act allowed local authorities around the country to incorporate green belt proposals in their first development plans.
The codification of Green Belt policy and its extension to areas other than London came with the historic Circular 42/55 inviting local planning authorities to consider the establishment of Green Belts.
The first urban growth boundary in the U.S. was in Fayette County, Kentucky, in 1958.
Maryland underwent many "Smart Growth" initiatives, starting in 1997 with the Smart Growth Areas Act.
This act allocated funding towards areas that either were already undergoing growth, or areas that had plans of growth.
Maryland also implemented the 1997 Rural Legacy Act, which distributed grants to private land owners and allowed them to purchase development rights.
Brownfields Voluntary Cleanup and Revitalization Incentive Programs also incentivized the usage of previously contaminated properties by allowing property owners to avoid liability for the property.
The state also offered incentives, such as tax breaks and loans for repairs to contaminated areas.
Another program created by the state of Maryland was the Job Creation Tax Credit Program, which encouraged businesses to relocate into select areas, reducing the intensity of urban sprawl in some areas.
The Live Near Your Work Program also incentivized employees to purchase homes in areas closer to their work.
This led to a reduced commute time, and more of an emphasis on homeownership rather than renting.
The term "smart growth" has been particularly used in North America.
The terms "compact city" and "urban intensification" are often used to describe similar concepts in Europe, and particularly in the UK, where it has influenced government policy and planning practice in recent years.
The state of Oregon enacted a law in 1973 limiting the area urban areas could occupy, through urban growth boundaries.
As a result, Portland, the state's largest urban area, has become a leader in smart growth policies that seek to make urban areas more compact (they are called urban consolidation policies).
After the creation of this boundary, the population density of the urbanized area increased somewhat (from 1,135 in 1970 to 1,290 per km2 in 2000.)
Although the growth boundary has not been tight enough to vastly increase density, the consensus is that the growth boundaries have protected great amounts of wild areas and farmland around the metro area.
Much of San Francisco Bay Area has also adopted urban growth boundaries; 25 of its cities and 5 of its counties have urban growth boundaries.
Many of these were adopted with the support and advocacy of Greenbelt Alliance, a non-profit land conservation and urban planning organization.
In other areas, the design principles of New Urbanism have been employed to combat urban sprawl.
The concept of circular flow land use management has been developed in Europe to reduce land take by urban sprawl through promoting inner-city and brownfield development.
Although cities such as Los Angeles are well known for sprawling suburbs, policies and public opinion are changing.
Transit-oriented development, in which higher-density mixed-use areas are permitted or encouraged near transit stops, is encouraging more compact development in certain areas: particularly those with light and heavy rail transit systems.
People living the closest to these business districts on average have more money to spend locally because they spend less on their cars.
Because such people rely more on bicycling, walking, and transit than on driving, they tend to focus more of their commerce on locally-owned neighborhood businesses that are convenient for them to reach.
Walkability is a measure of how friendly an area is to walking.
Walkability has many health, environmental, and economic benefits.
However, evaluating walkability is challenging because it requires the consideration of many subjective factors.
Factors influencing walkability include the presence or absence and quality of footpaths, sidewalks, or other pedestrian right-of-ways, traffic and road conditions, land use patterns, building accessibility, and safety, among others.
Walkability is an important concept in sustainable urban design.
Land use policies are one potential avenue to reduce the effects of urban sprawl.
These policies take the form of boundaries to urban growth, regional development rights, and development centralized in urban areas.
Housing policies, such as inclusionary zoning, rental vouchers in suburban areas, and a focus on employer-assisted housing are another approach to combatting urban sprawl.
Gasoline taxes and increased funding towards the construction of public transportation also help to reduce the necessity of commuting in and out of urban areas.
Vehicle audio is equipment installed in a car or other vehicle to provide in-car entertainment and information for the occupants.
Until the 1950s, it consisted of a simple AM radio.
Additions since then have included FM radio (1952), 8-track tape players, cassette players, record players, CD players, DVD players, Blu-ray players, navigation systems, Bluetooth telephone integration and audio streaming, and smartphone controllers like CarPlay and Android Auto.
Once controlled from the dashboard with a few buttons, they can be controlled by steering wheel controls and voice commands.
Initially implemented for listening to music and radio, vehicle audio is now part of car telematics, telecommunication, in-vehicle security, handsfree calling, navigation, and remote diagnostics systems.
The same loudspeakers may also be used to minimize road and engine noise with active noise control, or they may be used to augment engine sounds, for example, making a small engine sound bigger.
In 1904, before commercially viable technology for mobile radio was in place, American inventor and self-described "Father of Radio" Lee de Forest demonstrated a car radio at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis.
Around 1920, vacuum tube technology had matured to the point where the availability of radio receivers made radio broadcasting viable.
A technical challenge was that the vacuum tubes in the radio receivers required 50 to 250 volt direct current, but car batteries ran at 6V. Voltage was stepped up with a vibrator that provided a pulsating DC which could be converted to a higher voltage with a transformer, rectified, and filtered to create higher-voltage DC.
In 1924, Kelly's Motors in NSW, Australia, installed its first car radio.
In 1930, the American Galvin Manufacturing Corporation marketed a Motorola-branded radio receiver for $130.
It was expensive: the contemporary Ford Model A cost $540.
A Plymouth sedan, "wired for Philco Transitone radio without extra cost," was advertised in Ladies' Home Journal in 1931.
In 1932 in Germany the Blaupunkt AS 5 medium wave and longwave radio was marketed for 465 Reichsmark, about one-third of the price of a small car.
Because it took nearly 10 litres of space, it could not be located near the driver and was operated via a steering wheel remote control.
In 1933, Crossley Motors offered a factory fitted car radio for £35.
By the late 1930s, push button AM radios were considered a standard feature.
In 1946, there were an estimated 9 million AM car radios in use.
An FM receiver was offered by Blaupunkt in 1952.
In 1953, Becker introduced the AM/FM Becker Mexico with a Variometer tuner, basically a station-search or scan function.
In April 1955, the Chrysler Corporation announced that it was offering a Mopar model 914HR branded Philco all-transistor car radio, as a $150 option for its 1956 Chrysler and Imperial car models.
Chrysler Corporation had decided to discontinue its all-transistor car radio option at the end of 1956, due to it being too expensive, and replaced it with a cheaper hybrid (transistors and low voltage vacuum tubes) car radio for its new 1957 car models.
In 1963, Becker introduced the Monte Carlo, a tubeless solid state radio with no vacuum tubes.
From 1974 to 2005, the Autofahrer-Rundfunk-Informationssystem was used by the German ARD network.
Developed jointly by the Institut für Rundfunktechnik and Blaupunkt, it indicated the presence of traffic announcements through manipulation of the 57kHz subcarrier of the station's FM signal.
ARI was replaced by the Radio Data System.
The AM/FM radio combined with a CD player has remained a mainstay of car audio, despite being obsolescent in non-car applications.
In the 2010s, internet radio, satellite radio, streaming, and podcasting came into competition with AM/FM radio.
By this time some models were offering 5.1 surround sound.
In 2023, several automobile manufacturers, including Ford Motor Company, announced plans to discontinue offering the AM radio band in new vehicles, starting with the 2024 model year.
Ford later reversed its announcement, with chief executive officer Jim Farley citing the importance of AM's emergency alert system.
Audi, BMW, Volvo, and Tesla had already started to not offer the AM band on their entertainment systems, specifically on their electric vehicles.
The previous announcement had several lawmakers introduce bipartisan legislation to require that automobile manufactures include the AM band on their audio/entertainment systems.
Mobile players for physical media have been provided for vinyl records, 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, compact discs, and MP3s.
The increased sophistication of the vehicle audio system to accommodate such media has made the audio unit a common target of car break-ins, so these are equipped with anti-theft systems too.
Attempts at providing mobile play from media were first made with vinyl records, beginning in the 1950s.
The first such player was offered by Chrysler as an option on 1956 Chrysler, Desoto, Dodge, and Plymouth cars.
The player was developed by CBS Labs and played a limited selection of specially provided 7-inch discs at 16⅔ RPM.
The unit was an expensive option and was dropped after two years.
Cheaper options using commonly available 45 rpm records were made by RCA Victor (available only in 1961) and Norelco.
All of these players required extra pressure on the needle to avoid skipping during vehicle movement, which caused accelerated wear on the records.
In 1962, Muntz introduced the Wayfarer 4-track cartridge tape player.
Celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, had these units installed in their cars.
In 1965, Ford and Motorola jointly introduced the in-car 8-track tape player as optional equipment for 1966 Ford car models.
In 1968, a dashboard car radio with a built-in cassette tape player was introduced by Philips.
In subsequent years, cassettes supplanted the 8-track and improved the technology, with longer play times, better tape quality, auto-reverse, and Dolby noise reduction.
They were popular throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
Cassette players were still found in vehicles as late as the 2005–06 Honda CR-V and 2008 Acura TL.
There have also been vehicle audio units that accept both compact cassettes and CDs.
Pioneer introduced the CDX-1, the first car CD (compact disc) player, in 1984.
It was known for its improved sound quality, instant track skipping, and the format's increased durability over cassette tapes.
Car CD changers started to gain popularity in the late 1980s and continued throughout the 1990s, with the earlier devices being trunk-mounted and later ones being mounted in the head unit, some able to accommodate six to ten CDs.
Stock and aftermarket CD players began appearing in the late 1980s, competing with the cassette.
The first car with an OEM CD player was the 1987 Lincoln Town Car, and the last new cars in the American market to be factory-equipped with a cassette deck in the dashboard was the 2010 Lexus SC430, and the Ford Crown Victoria.
A car cassette adapter allowed motorists to plug in a portable music player (CD player, MP3 player) into an existing installed cassette tape deck.
In the early 21st century, compact digital storage media – Bluetooth-enabled devices, thumb drives, memory cards, and dedicated hard drives – came to be accommodated by vehicle audio systems.
Around this time auxiliary input jacks and USB ports were added to connect MP3 players to the vehicle's speakers.
Minivans and three-row SUVs have an available rear entertainment system with a DVD player to entertain passengers.
The automobile head unit became increasingly important as a housing for front and backup dashcams, navis, and operating systems with multiple functions, such as Android Auto, CarPlay and MirrorLink, allowing a smartphone's music library and navigation apps to be controlled via the vehicle's infotainment system.
Latest models are coming equipped with features like Bluetooth technology along with HDMI port for better connectivity.
Screen size varies from 5-inch to 7-inch for the double Din car stereos.
The automobile sound system may be part of an active noise control system which reduces engine and road noise for the driver and passengers.
One or more microphones are used to pick up sound from various places on the vehicle, especially the engine compartment, underside, or exhaust pipes, and these signals are handled by a digital signal processor (DSP) and then sent to the loudspeakers in such a way that the processed signal reduces or cancels out the outside noise heard inside the car.
An early system focused only on engine noise was developed by Lotus and licensed for the 1992 Nissan Bluebird models sold in Japan.
Lotus later teamed with Harman in 2009 to develop a more complete noise reduction system, including road and tire noise as well as chassis vibrations.
One benefit of active noise control is that the car can weigh less, with less sound-deadening material used, and without a heavy balance shaft in the engine.
Removing the balance shaft also increases fuel efficiency.
The 2013 Honda Accord used an active noise control system, as did the 2013 Lincoln luxury line and the Ford C-Max and Fusion models.
Other operating data may also play a part in the DSP, data such as the engine's speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) or the car's highway speed.
A multiple source reduction system may reach as much as 80% of the noise removed.
The same system may also be used to synthesize or augment engine noise to make the engine sound more powerful to the driver.
For the 2015 Ford Mustang EcoBoost Fastback and EcoBoost Fastback Premium, an "Active Noise Control" system was developed that amplifies the engine sound through the car speakers.
A similar system is used in the F-150 pickup truck.
Volkswagen uses a Soundaktor, a special speaker to play sounds in cars such as the Golf GTi and Beetle Turbo.
BMW plays a recorded sample of its motors through the car speakers, using different samples according to the engine's load and power.
The stock system is the OEM application that the vehicle's manufacturer specified to be installed when the car was built.
Aftermarket components can also be used.
Head unit: Headunit products includes the screen and buttons and are manufactured mainly in DIN form factor, which refers to ISO 7736.
Head units come as single DIN or double DIN.
Connectors for car audio, where ISO 10487 Harness Adapter is used.
Capacitors.
Mobile audio power amplifiers.
Amplifiers increase the power level of audio signals.
Some head units have built-in stereo amplifiers.
Other car audio systems use a separate stand-alone amplifier.
Every amplifier has a rated power level sometimes noted on the head unit with the built-in amplifier, or on the label of a stand-alone unit.
Coaxial speakers: These are the most common type of car speakers and are often factory-installed.
They usually consist of a woofer and a tweeter mounted on the same axis, and are designed to reproduce a wide range of frequencies.
Component speakers: These speakers are designed for higher-end car audio systems and typically consist of separate woofers, tweeters, and crossovers.
This allows for more precise sound tuning and a higher level of sound quality.
Subwoofers: These speakers are designed to reproduce low-frequency sounds, particularly bass.
They come in various sizes and power levels, and can be used to enhance the bass in a car audio system.
Mid-range speakers: These speakers are designed to reproduce mid-range frequencies, such as vocals and instruments like guitars and pianos.
These speakers are designed to reproduce high-frequency sounds, such as cymbals and other high-pitched instruments.
Sound-deadening material is often used in the door cavities and boot area to dampen excess vibration of the panels in the car in response to loud subwoofer bass tones, especially the boot (trunk).
Optical drives with slot-loading mechanism.
Excessively loud sound systems in automobiles violate the noise ordinance of municipalities, some of which have outlawed them.
In 2002, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a guide to police officers on how to deal with problems associated with loud audio systems in cars.
A vehicle horn is a sound-making device installed on motor vehicles,  trains, boats, and other types of vehicles.
The sound it makes usually resembles a “honk” (older vehicles) or a “beep” (modern vehicles).
The driver uses the horn to warn people of danger.
The horn is activated to warn others of the vehicle's presence or approach, or to call attention to some hazard.
Motor vehicles, ships and trains are required by law in some countries to have horns.
Trams, trollies, streetcars, and even bicycles are also legally required to have an audible warning device in many areas.
Modern car horns are usually electric, driven by a flat circular steel diaphragm that has an electromagnet acting on it in one direction and a spring pulling in the opposite direction.
The diaphragm is attached to contact points that repeatedly interrupt the current to that electromagnet causing the diaphragm to spring back the other way, which completes the circuit again.
This arrangement opens and closes the circuit hundreds of times per second, which creates a loud noise like a buzzer or electric bell, which sound enters a horn to be amplified.
A traditional style automobile horn includes an expansion chamber cast into its body, once spiral shaped, to better match the acoustical impedance of the diaphragm with open air, and thus more effectively transfer the sound energy.
Sound levels of typical car horns are approximately 107–109 decibels, and they typically draw 5–6 amperes of current.
Horns can be used singly, but are often arranged in pairs to produce an interval consisting of two notes, sounded together; although this doubles the sound volume, the use of two differing frequencies is more perceptible to the human ear than two horns of the same frequency, particularly in an environment with a high ambient noise level.
Typical frequencies of a pair of horns of this design are 500 Hz and 405–420 Hz (approximately B4 and G♯4, minor third).
Most cars, motorcycles, and motor scooters have for some time used a cheaper and smaller alternative design, which, despite retaining the name "horn," abandons the actual horn ducting and instead relies on a larger flat diaphragm to reach the required sound level.
Sound levels of such horns are approximately 109–112 decibels, and they typically draw 2.5–5 amperes of current.
Again, these horns can be either single, or arranged in pairs; typical frequencies for a pair are 420–440 Hz and 340–370 Hz (approximately G♯4–A4 and F4–F♯4) for this design.
A horn grille is a part of some designs of car or other motor vehicle that has an electric horn, such as a motor scooter.
Larger, louder air horns, as found on trucks (lorries) and buses, are driven by air compressors, or supplied by reservoirs charged to operate their air brakes.
The compressor forces air past a diaphragm in the horn's throat, causing it to vibrate.
Usually two are used, with varied frequencies generally lower than those of automobile horns, in the 125–180 Hz (approximately C3–G3) range.
Sound levels are approximately 117–118 decibels.
that are both louder and lower in frequency than motor vehicle  horns.
Operated by compressed air from the train's  air brake system, their sound level is 146–175 dB. In the United States, train horns are required to have a minimum sound level of 96 dB and a maximum sound level of 110 dB at 100 ft (30 m) in front of the train.
To distinguish their sound from truck and bus air horns, train horns in the U.S. consist of groups of two to five horns (called "chimes") which have different notes, sounded together to form a chord.
In Japan, most modern trains like 209 series or E233 series from the first half of the 1990s onwards use electric horns as primary in passenger use.
Although electric horns were used by Seibu 2000 series, air horns were primarily used until the 1990s.
Modern Japanese trains may still be equipped with both air horns and electric horns.
Most modern streetcars, trams and trolley cars including low-floor vehicles around the world also employ horns or whistles as a secondary auditory warning signal in addition to the gong/bell which either use the sound of air horns or electric automobile car horns.
Ships signal to each other and to the shore with air horns, sometimes called whistles, that are driven with compressed air or from steam tapped from the power plant.
Low frequencies are used, because they travel further than high frequencies; horns from ships have been heard as far as fifteen kilometres (ten miles).
Traditionally, the lower the frequency, the larger the ship.
The RMS Queen Mary, an ocean liner launched in 1934, had three horns based on 55 Hz (corresponding to A1 ), a frequency chosen because it was low enough that the very loud sound of it would not be painful to the passengers.
Modern International Maritime Organization regulations specify that ships' horn frequencies be in the range 70–200 Hz (corresponding to C♯2-G3) for vessels that are over 200 m (660 ft) in length.
For vessels between 200 and 75 m (660 and 250 ft) the range is 130–350 Hz and for vessels under 75 m (250 ft) it is 70–700 Hz.
Smaller craft typically use electric diaphragm horns.
Portable air horns driven by canned compressed air are also used, as well as for officiating sports events and recreational activities.
Small battery-operated electric horns, as well as the traditional single-reed bulb horn, are typically used on bicycles.
Various types of vehicle horns are used by percussionists as sound effects, or even melodically, in musical works.
For example, George Gershwin's 1928 orchestral work An American in Paris calls for the use of 4 taxi horns.
György Ligeti's opera Le Grand Macabre features two "Car Horn Preludes" scored for 12 bulb horns, each one tuned to a specific pitch.
A klaxon is a type of an electromechanical horn or alerting device.
Mainly used on cars, trains and ships, it produces an easily identifiable sound, often transcribed onomatopoeiacally in English as "awooga".
Like most mechanical horns, it has largely been replaced by solid-state electronic alarms, though the memorable tone has persisted.
Klaxon was originally a brand name.
The klaxon horn's characteristic sound is produced by a spring-steel diaphragm with a rivet in the center that is repeatedly struck by the teeth of a rotating cogwheel.
The diaphragm is attached to a horn that acts as an acoustic transformer and controls the direction of the sound.
In the first klaxons, the wheel was driven either by hand or by an electric motor.
American inventor Miller Reese Hutchison (later chief engineer of Thomas Edison) patented the mechanism in 1908.
The Lovell-McConnell Manufacturing Company of Newark, New Jersey bought the rights to the device and it became standard equipment on General Motors cars.
Franklyn Hallett Lovell Jr., the founder, coined the name klaxon from the Ancient Greek verb klazō, "I shriek".
Klaxons were first fitted to automobiles and bicycles in 1908.
They were originally powered by six-volt dry cells, and from 1911 by rechargeable batteries.
Later hand-powered versions were used as military evacuation alarms and factory sirens.
They were also used as submarine dive and surface alarms beginning in the Second World War.
The klaxophone is a musical instrument that makes use of the klaxon's unique sound.
The English company Klaxon Signals Ltd. has been based in Oldham, England for the last 80 years, with premises also in Birmingham.
The French Klaxon company was acquired by the Italian Fiamm Group in the 1990s.
In 2005 Klaxon Signals sold the rights for the hooter or klaxon range to Moflash Signalling Ltd., based in the original Klaxon Factory in Birmingham, England.
The Moflash Company discontinued the Klaxet hooter in 2013, but continued to produce the A1 hooter, the only original Klaxon left in production.
Several languages have either borrowed or transcribed the name into their lexicons.
In Japanese, the word "klaxon" (クラクション, kurakushon) refers to car horns in general.
This is also true in languages such as French (klaxon), Italian (clacson), Greek (κλάξον), Dutch (claxon), Russian (клаксон), Polish (klakson), Spanish (claxon), Romanian (claxon), Czech (klakson), Turkish (klakson), Indonesian (klakson), Some Arabic dialects (كلاكسون) and Korean (클랙슨).
outside built-up areas to warn a driver that they are about to be overtaken.
One major use of a vehicle mat is to keep the car looking clean.
Most mats can be easily removed for cleaning and then replaced.
Some require fixation points to ensure they remain fixed in position.
Mats are generally considered unnecessary in vehicles which are permanently fitted with rubber carpets - such as commercial vehicles (trucks, vans) and some off road and agricultural vehicles.
Vehicle mats are an interior car parts accessory that dealerships generally include with the purchase of a vehicle.
However, with the surge in leasing organizations and sales through such channels, some cars are offered without them.
Vehicle floor mats come in a variety of shapes and materials.
They may feature spikes, grooves, or caps to capture dirt and water, and be made from the synthetic rubber (often referred to as "vinyl" or "thermoplastic") or textile materials.
Vehicle mats generally come in two options: either rubber or carpet fabric.
These differ in a number of ways, and each material provides advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other.
For instance, carpet mats are generally tufted and have a rubberized anti-slip backing, while rubber mats are heavier-duty and more durable.
Also, some car mats are the plain color of rubber, while many others contain branded company logos, cartoon characters, or advertisements.
They can also come in a wide range of colors.
The terms "universal" and "custom fit" differentiate between floor mats that will fit a multitude of different cars versus those that are specifically designed to fit only one chassis.
Some styles of mats may feature small, flexible spikes on their underside to grip carpeting underneath.
A more common method of retention, though, is a fitting system that hooks, clips, or twists into an anchor point already positioned on the vehicle floor.
This anchor is typically pre-installed by the OEM but some aftermarket manufacturers of "custom fit" mats also provide this.
Car mats produced by original equipment manufacturers must follow stringent regulations in the US, especially due to recent recalls of Toyota car mats that posed safety hazards.
Factors that are regulated include odor release, durability, performance in various heat levels, etc.
Safety systems are also increasingly common in rubber mats; for example, an anti-slip bottom side and a heel pad for added safety and wear.
Original equipment manufacturers are now starting to develop non-OEM channels to offer reduced cost vehicle mats and to expand their markets.
Custom manufacturers are now coming to the forefront of the vehicle mat industry.
On September 26, 2007, Toyota recalled 55,000 sets of heavy-duty rubber floor mats for the Toyota Camry and  Lexus ES 350  sedans.
The recalled mats were of the optional "all-weather" type.
The NHTSA stated that the recall was due to the risk that unsecured mats could move forward and trap the gas pedal.
On August 28, 2009, a two-car collision killed four people riding in a Lexus dealer-provided loaner ES 350 in San Diego, California; the accident was caused by the Lexus' incorrectly having been fitted with all-weather rubber floor mats meant for the RX 400h SUV, and the fact that these mats were not secured by either of the two retaining clips.
Additionally, the brake hardware showed signs of heavy braking consistent with a stuck accelerator pedal.
The investigators' report stated that the accelerator pedal's hinge did not allow relieving of obstructions, and the dashboard lacked directions for the three-second emergency press of the push button keyless ignition.
NHTSA investigators also recovered the accident vehicle's accelerator pedal, which was still "bonded" to the SUV floor mat.
A vehicle (from Latin  vehiculum) is a machine designed for self-propulsion, usually to transport people, cargo, or both.
Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses, mobility scooters), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats, underwater vehicles), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicles, hovercraft),  aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, aerostats), and spacecraft.
Ground vehicles can be broadly classified by the type of contact with the ground: wheels, tracks, rails, or skis.
ISO 3833-1977 is the international standard for road vehicle types, terms, and definitions.
A 7,000 year-old seagoing boat made from reeds and tar has been found in Kuwait.
Boats were used between 4000 -3000 BC in Sumer, ancient Egypt and in the Indian Ocean.
There is evidence of camel pulled wheeled vehicles about 4000–3000 BC.
The earliest evidence of a wagonway, a predecessor of the railway, found so far was the 6 to 8.5 km (4 to 5 mi) long Diolkos wagonway, which transported boats across the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece since around 600 BC.
Wheeled vehicles pulled by men and animals ran in grooves in limestone, which provided the track element, preventing the wagons from leaving the intended route.
In 200 CE, Ma Jun built a south-pointing chariot, a vehicle with an early form of guidance system.
The stagecoach, a four-wheeled vehicle drawn by horses, originated in 13th century England.
Railways began reappearing in Europe after the Dark Ages.
The earliest known record of a railway in Europe from this period is a stained-glass window in the Minster of Freiburg im Breisgau dating from around 1350.
In 1515, Cardinal Matthäus Lang wrote a description of the Reisszug, a funicular railway at the Hohensalzburg Fortress in Austria.
The line originally used wooden rails and a hemp haulage rope and was operated by human or animal power, through a treadwheel.
Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is often credited with building the first self-propelled mechanical vehicle or automobile in 1769.
In Russia, in the 1780s, Ivan Kulibin developed a human-pedalled, three-wheeled carriage with modern features such as a flywheel, brake, gear box and bearings; however, it was not developed further.
1801 Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, which many believe was the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle, though it could not maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.
1817 Pushbikes (now a British informal term for bicycles), draisines or hobby horses were the first human means of transport to make use of the two-wheeler principle, the draisienne (or Laufmaschine, "running machine"), invented by the German Baron Karl von Drais, is regarded as the forerunner of the modern bicycle (and motorcycle).
It was introduced by Drais to the public in Mannheim in summer 1817.
Otto Lilienthal began experimental gliding and achieved the first sustained, controlled, reproducible flights.
The number of road motor vehicles in operation worldwide surpassed the 1 billion mark – roughly one for every seven people.
There are over 1 billion bicycles in use worldwide.
In 2002 there were an estimated 590 million cars and 205 million motorcycles in service in the world.
At least 500 million Chinese Flying Pigeon bicycles have been made, more than any other single model of vehicle.
The most-produced model of motor vehicle is the Honda Super Cub motorcycle, having sold 60 million units in 2008.
The most-produced car model is the Toyota Corolla, with at least 35 million made by 2010.
The most common fixed-wing airplane is the Cessna 172, with about 44,000 having been made as of 2017.
The Soviet Mil Mi-8, at 17,000, is the most-produced helicopter.
The top commercial jet airliner is the Boeing 737, at about 10,000 in 2018.
At around 14,000 for both, the most produced trams are the KTM-5 and Tatra T3.
The most common trolleybus is ZiU-9.
Locomotion consists of a means that allows displacement with little opposition, a power source to provide the required kinetic energy and a means to control the motion, such as a brake and steering system.
By far, most vehicles use wheels which employ the principle of rolling to enable displacement with very little rolling friction.
It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it.
Energy can be extracted from external sources, as in the cases of a sailboat, a solar-powered car, or an electric streetcar that uses overhead lines.
Energy can also be stored, provided it can be converted on demand and the storing medium's energy density and power density are sufficient to meet the vehicle's needs.
Human power is a simple source of energy that requires nothing more than humans.
Despite the fact that humans cannot exceed 500 W (0.67 hp) for meaningful amounts of time, the land speed record for human-powered vehicles (unpaced) is 133 km/h (83 mph), as of 2009 on a recumbent bicycle.
The energy source used to power vehicles is fuel.
External combustion engines can use almost anything that burns as fuel, whilst internal combustion engines and rocket engines are designed to burn a specific fuel, typically gasoline, diesel or ethanol.
Food is the fuel used to power non-motor vehicles such as cycles, rickshaws and other pedestrian-controlled vehicles.
Another common medium for storing energy is batteries, which have the advantages of being responsive, useful in a wide range of power levels, environmentally friendly, efficient, simple to install, and easy to maintain.
Batteries also facilitate the use of electric motors, which have their own advantages.
On the other hand, batteries have low energy densities, short service life, poor performance at extreme temperatures, long charging times, and difficulties with disposal (although they can usually be recycled).
Like fuel, batteries store chemical energy and can cause burns and poisoning in event of an accident.
Batteries also lose effectiveness with time.
The issue of charge time can be resolved by swapping discharged batteries with charged ones; however, this incurs additional hardware costs and may be impractical for larger batteries.
Moreover, there must be standard batteries for battery swapping to work at a gas station.
Fuel cells are similar to batteries in that they convert from chemical to electrical energy, but have their own advantages and disadvantages.
Electrified rails and overhead cables are a common source of electrical energy on subways, railways, trams, and trolleybuses.
Solar energy is a more modern development, and several solar vehicles have been successfully built and tested, including Helios, a solar-powered aircraft.
Nuclear power is a more exclusive form of energy storage, currently limited to large ships and submarines, mostly military.
Nuclear energy can be released by a nuclear reactor, nuclear battery, or repeatedly detonating nuclear bombs.
There have been two experiments with nuclear-powered aircraft, the Tupolev Tu-119 and the Convair X-6.
Mechanical strain is another method of storing energy, whereby an elastic band or metal spring is deformed and releases energy as it is allowed to return to its ground state.
Systems employing elastic materials suffer from hysteresis, and metal springs are too dense to be useful in many cases.
Flywheels store energy in a spinning mass.
Because a light and fast rotor is energetically favorable, flywheels can pose a significant safety hazard.
Moreover, flywheels leak energy fairly quickly and affect a vehicle's steering through the gyroscopic effect.
They have been used experimentally in gyrobuses.
Wind energy is used by sailboats and land yachts as the primary source of energy.
It is very cheap and fairly easy to use, the main issues being dependence on weather and upwind performance.
Balloons also rely on the wind to move horizontally.
Aircraft flying in the jet stream may get a boost from high altitude winds.
Compressed gas is currently an experimental method of storing energy.
In this case, compressed gas is simply stored in a tank and released when necessary.
Like elastics, they have hysteresis losses when gas heats up during compression.
Gravitational potential energy is a form of energy used in gliders, skis, bobsleds and numerous other vehicles that go down hill.
Regenerative braking is an example of capturing kinetic energy where the brakes of a vehicle are augmented with a generator or other means of extracting energy.
When needed, the energy is taken from the source and consumed by one or more motors or engines.
Sometimes there is an intermediate medium, such as the batteries of a diesel submarine.
Most motor vehicles have internal combustion engines.
They are fairly cheap, easy to maintain, reliable, safe and small.
Since these engines burn fuel, they have long ranges but pollute the environment.
A related engine is the external combustion engine.
An example of this is the steam engine.
Aside from fuel, steam engines also need water, making them impractical for some purposes.
Steam engines also need time to warm up, whereas IC engines can usually run right after being started, although this may not be recommended in cold conditions.
Steam engines burning coal release sulfur into the air, causing harmful acid rain.
While intermittent internal combustion engines were once the primary means of aircraft propulsion, they have been largely superseded by continuous internal combustion engines, such as gas turbines.
Turbine engines are light and, particularly when used on aircraft, efficient.
On the other hand, they cost more and require careful maintenance.
They can also be damaged by ingesting foreign objects, and they produce a hot exhaust.
Trains using turbines are called gas turbine-electric locomotives.
Examples of surface vehicles using turbines are M1 Abrams, MTT Turbine SUPERBIKE and the Millennium.
Pulse jet engines are similar in many ways to turbojets but have almost no moving parts.
For this reason, they were very appealing to vehicle designers in the past; however, their noise, heat, and inefficiency have led to their abandonment.
A historical example of the use of a pulse jet was the V-1 flying bomb.
Pulse jets are still occasionally used in amateur experiments.
With the advent of modern technology, the pulse detonation engine has become practical and was successfully tested on a Rutan VariEze.
While the pulse detonation engine is much more efficient than the pulse jet and even turbine engines, it still suffers from extreme noise and vibration levels.
Ramjets also have few moving parts, but they only work at high speed, so their use is restricted to tip jet helicopters and high speed aircraft such as the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.
Rocket engines are primarily used on rockets, rocket sleds and experimental aircraft.
Rocket engines are extremely powerful.
The heaviest vehicle ever to leave the ground, the Saturn V rocket, was powered by five F-1 rocket engines generating a combined 180 million horsepower (134.2 gigawatt).
Rocket engines also have no need to "push off" anything, a fact that the New York Times denied in error.
Rocket engines can be particularly simple, sometimes consisting of nothing more than a catalyst, as in the case of a hydrogen peroxide rocket.
This makes them an attractive option for vehicles such as jet packs.
Despite their simplicity, rocket engines are often dangerous and susceptible to explosions.
The fuel they run off may be flammable, poisonous, corrosive or cryogenic.
They also suffer from poor efficiency.
For these reasons, rocket engines are only used when absolutely necessary.
Electric motors are used in electric vehicles such as electric bicycles, electric scooters, small boats, subways, trains, trolleybuses, trams and experimental aircraft.
Electric motors can be very efficient: over 90% efficiency is common.
Electric motors can also be built to be powerful, reliable, low-maintenance and of any size.
Electric motors can deliver a range of speeds and torques without necessarily using a gearbox (although it may be more economical to use one).
Electric motors are limited in their use chiefly by the difficulty of supplying electricity.
Compressed gas motors have been used on some vehicles experimentally.
They are simple, efficient, safe, cheap, reliable and operate in a variety of conditions.
One of the difficulties met when using gas motors is the cooling effect of expanding gas.
These engines are limited by how quickly they absorb heat from their surroundings.
The cooling effect can, however, double as air conditioning.
Compressed gas motors also lose effectiveness with falling gas pressure.
Ion thrusters are used on some satellites and spacecraft.
They are only effective in a vacuum, which limits their use to spaceborne vehicles.
Ion thrusters run primarily off electricity, but they also need a propellant such as caesium, or, more recently xenon.
Ion thrusters can achieve extremely high speeds and use little propellant; however, they are power-hungry.
The mechanical energy that motors and engines produce must be converted to work by wheels, propellers, nozzles, or similar means.
Aside from converting mechanical energy into motion, wheels allow a vehicle to roll along a surface and, with the exception of railed vehicles, to be steered.
Wheels are ancient technology, with specimens being discovered from over 5000 years ago.
Wheels are used in a plethora of vehicles, including motor vehicles, armoured personnel carriers, amphibious vehicles, airplanes, trains, skateboards and wheelbarrows.
Nozzles are used in conjunction with almost all reaction engines.
Vehicles using nozzles include jet aircraft, rockets, and personal watercraft.
While most nozzles take the shape of a cone or bell, some unorthodox designs have been created such as the aerospike.
Some nozzles are intangible, such as the electromagnetic field nozzle of a vectored ion thruster.
Continuous track is sometimes used instead of wheels to power land vehicles.
Continuous track has the advantages of a larger contact area, easy repairs on small damage, and high maneuverability.
Examples of vehicles using continuous tracks are tanks, snowmobiles and excavators.
Two continuous tracks used together allow for steering.
The largest land vehicle in the world, the Bagger 293, is propelled by continuous tracks.
Propellers (as well as screws, fans and rotors) are used to move through a fluid.
Propellers have been used as toys since ancient times; however, it was Leonardo da Vinci who devised what was one of the earliest propeller driven vehicles, the "aerial-screw".
In 1661, Toogood & Hays adopted the screw for use as a ship propeller.
Since then, the propeller has been tested on many terrestrial vehicles, including the Schienenzeppelin train and numerous cars.
In modern times, propellers are most prevalent on watercraft and aircraft, as well as some amphibious vehicles such as hovercraft and ground-effect vehicles.
Intuitively, propellers cannot work in space as there is no working fluid; however, some sources have suggested that since space is never empty, a propeller could be made to work in space.
Similarly to propeller vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion.
Sailboats and sailplanes are propelled by the forward component of lift generated by their sails/wings.
Ornithopters also produce thrust aerodynamically.
Ornithopters with large rounded leading edges produce lift by leading-edge suction forces.
Research at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies  lead to a flight with an actual ornithopter on July 31, 2010.
Paddle wheels are used on some older watercraft and their reconstructions.
These ships were known as paddle steamers.
Because paddle wheels simply push against the water, their design and construction is very simple.
The oldest such ship in scheduled service is the Skibladner.
Many pedalo boats also use paddle wheels for propulsion.
Screw-propelled vehicles are propelled by auger-like cylinders fitted with helical flanges.
Because they can produce thrust on both land and water, they are commonly used on all-terrain vehicles.
The ZiL-2906 was a Soviet-designed screw-propelled vehicle designed to retrieve cosmonauts from the Siberian wilderness.
All or almost all of the useful energy produced by the engine is usually dissipated as friction; so minimising frictional losses is very important in many vehicles.
The main sources of friction are rolling friction and fluid drag (air drag or water drag).
Wheels have low bearing friction, and pneumatic tyres give low rolling friction.
Steel wheels on steel tracks are lower still.
Aerodynamic drag can be reduced by streamlined design features.
Friction is desirable and important in supplying traction to facilitate motion on land.
Most land vehicles rely on friction for accelerating, decelerating and changing direction.
Sudden reductions in traction can cause loss of control and accidents.
Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism.
Wheeled vehicles steer by angling their front or rear wheels.
The B-52 Stratofortress has a special arrangement in which all four main wheels can be angled.
Skids can also be used to steer by angling them, as in the case of a snowmobile.
Ships, boats, submarines, dirigibles and aeroplanes usually have a rudder for steering.
On an airplane, ailerons are used to bank the airplane for directional control, sometimes assisted by the rudder.
With no power applied, most vehicles come to a stop due to friction.
But it is often required to stop a vehicle faster than by friction alone, so almost all vehicles are equipped with a braking system.
Wheeled vehicles are typically equipped with friction brakes, which use the friction between brake pads (stators) and brake rotors to slow the vehicle.
Many airplanes have high-performance versions of the same system in their landing gear for use on the ground.
A Boeing 757 brake, for example, has 3 stators and 4 rotors.
The Space Shuttle also uses frictional brakes on its wheels.
As well as frictional brakes, hybrid and electric cars, trolleybuses and electric bicycles can also use regenerative brakes to recycle some of the vehicle's potential energy.
High-speed trains sometimes use frictionless Eddy-current brakes; however, widespread application of the technology has been limited by overheating and interference issues.
Aside from landing gear brakes, most large aircraft have other ways of decelerating.
In aircraft, air brakes are aerodynamic surfaces that provide braking force by increasing the frontal cross section, thus increasing the increasing the aerodynamic drag of the aircraft.
These are usually implemented as flaps that oppose air flow when extended and are flush with the aircraft when retracted.
Reverse thrust is also used in many aeroplane engines.
Propeller aircraft achieve reverse thrust by reversing the pitch of the propellers, while jet aircraft do so by redirecting their engine exhausts forward.
On aircraft carriers, arresting gears are used to stop an aircraft.
Pilots may even apply full forward throttle on touchdown, in case the arresting gear does not catch and a go around is needed.
Parachutes are used to slow down vehicles travelling very fast.
Parachutes have been used in land, air and space vehicles such as the ThrustSSC, Eurofighter Typhoon and Apollo Command Module.
Some older Soviet passenger jets had braking parachutes for emergency landings.
Boats use similar devices called sea anchors to maintain stability in rough seas.
To further increase the rate of deceleration or where the brakes have failed, several mechanisms can be used to stop a vehicle.
Cars and rolling stock usually have hand brakes that, while designed to secure an already parked vehicle, can provide limited braking should the primary brakes fail.
A secondary procedure called forward-slip is sometimes used to slow airplanes by flying at an angle, causing more drag.
Category M: passenger vehicles.
Category N: motor vehicles for the carriage of goods.
Category O: trailers and semi-trailers.
European Community is based on the Community's WVTA (whole vehicle type-approval) system.
Under this system, manufacturers can obtain certification for a vehicle type in one Member State if it meets the EC technical requirements and then market it EU-wide with no need for further tests.
Total technical harmonization already has been achieved in three vehicle categories (passenger cars, motorcycles, and tractors) and soon will extend to other vehicle categories (coaches and utility vehicles).
It is essential that European car manufacturers be ensured access to as large a market as possible.
While the Community type-approval system allows manufacturers to fully benefit fully from internal market opportunities, worldwide technical harmonization in the context of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) offers a market beyond European borders.
In many cases, it is unlawful to operate a vehicle without a license or certification.
The least strict form of regulation usually limits what passengers the driver may carry or prohibits them completely (e.g., a Canadian ultra-light license without endorsements).
The next level of licensing may allow passengers, but without any form of compensation or payment.
A private driver's license usually has these conditions.
Commercial licenses that allow the transport of passengers and cargo are more tightly regulated.
The most strict form of licensing is generally reserved for school buses, hazardous materials transports and emergency vehicles.
The driver of a motor vehicle is typically required to hold a valid driver's license while driving on public lands, whereas the pilot of an aircraft must have a license at all times, regardless of where in the jurisdiction the aircraft is flying.
Vehicles are often required to be registered.
Registration may be for purely legal reasons, for insurance reasons, or to help law enforcement recover stolen vehicles.
Toronto Police Service, for example, offers free and optional bicycle registration online.
On motor vehicles, registration often takes the form of a vehicle registration plate, which makes it easy to identify a vehicle.
In Russia, trucks and buses have their licence plate numbers repeated in large black letters on the back.
On aircraft, a similar system is used, where a tail number is painted on various surfaces.
Like motor vehicles and aircraft, watercraft also have registration numbers in most jurisdictions; however, the vessel name is still the primary means of identification  as has been the case since ancient times.
For this reason, duplicate registration names are generally rejected.
In Canada, boats with an engine power of 10 hp (7.5 kW) or greater require registration, leading to the ubiquitous "9.9 hp (7.4 kW)" engine.
Registration may be conditional on the vehicle being approved for use on public highways, as in the case of the UK and Ontario.
Many US states also have requirements for vehicles operating on public highways.
Aircraft have more stringent requirements, as they pose a high risk of damage to people and property in the event of an accident.
In the US, the FAA requires aircraft to have an airworthiness certificate.
Because US aircraft must be flown for some time before they are certified, there is a provision for an experimental airworthiness certificate.
FAA experimental aircraft are restricted in operation, including no overflights of populated areas, in busy airspace, or with unessential passengers.
Materials and parts used in FAA certified aircraft must meet the criteria set forth by the technical standard orders.
In many jurisdictions, the operator of a vehicle is legally obligated to carry safety equipment with or on them.
Common examples include seat belts in cars, helmets on motorcycles and bicycles, fire extinguishers on boats, buses and airplanes, and life jackets on boats and commercial aircraft.
Passenger aircraft carry a great deal of safety equipment, including inflatable slides, rafts, oxygen masks, oxygen tanks, life jackets, satellite beacons and first aid kits.
Some equipment, such as life jackets has led to debate regarding their usefulness.
In the case of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, the life jackets saved many people but also led to many deaths when passengers inflated their vests prematurely.
There are specific real-estate arrangements made to allow vehicles to travel from one place to another.
The most common arrangements are public highways, where appropriately licensed vehicles can navigate without hindrance.
These highways are on public land and are maintained by the government.
Similarly, toll routes are open to the public after paying a toll.
These routes and the land they rest on may be government-owned, privately owned or a combination of both.
Some routes are privately owned but grant access to the public.
These routes often have a warning sign stating that the government does not maintain them.
An example of this are byways in England and Wales.
In Scotland, land is open to unmotorized vehicles if it meets certain criteria.
Public land is sometimes open to use by off-road vehicles.
On US public land, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) decides where vehicles may be used.
Railways often pass over land not owned by the railway company.
The right to this land is granted to the railway company through mechanisms such as easement.
Watercraft are generally allowed to navigate public waters without restriction as long as they do not cause a disturbance.
Passing through a lock, however, may require paying a toll.
Despite the common law tradition Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos of owning all the air above one's property, the US Supreme Court ruled that aircraft in the US have the right to use air above someone else's property without their consent.
While the same rule generally applies in all jurisdictions, some countries, such as Cuba and Russia, have taken advantage of air rights on a national level to earn money.
There are some areas that aircraft are barred from overflying.
This is called prohibited airspace.
Prohibited airspace is usually strictly enforced due to potential damage from espionage or attack.
In the case of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, the airliner entered prohibited airspace over Soviet territory and was shot down as it was leaving.
Several different metrics used to compare and evaluate the safety of different vehicles.
The main three are deaths per billion passenger-journeys, deaths per billion passenger-hours and deaths per billion passenger-kilometers.
Emission standards  are the legal requirements governing air pollutants released into the atmosphere.
Emission standards set quantitative limits on the permissible amount of specific air pollutants that may be released from specific sources over specific timeframes.
They are generally designed to achieve air quality standards and to protect human life.
Different regions and countries have different standards for vehicle emissions.
Many emissions standards focus on regulating pollutants released by automobiles (motor cars) and other powered vehicles.
Others regulate emissions from industry, power plants, small equipment such as lawn mowers and diesel generators, and other sources of air pollution.
The first automobile emissions standards were enacted in 1963 in the United States, mainly as a response to Los Angeles' smog problems.
Three years later Japan enacted their first emissions rules, followed between 1970 and 1972 by Canada, Australia, and several European nations.
The early standards mainly concerned carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC).
Regulations on nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) were introduced in the United States, Japan, and Canada in 1973 and 1974, with Sweden following in 1976 and the European Economic Community in 1977.
These standards gradually grew more and more stringent but have never been unified.
There are largely three main sets of standards: United States, Japanese, and European, with various markets mostly using these as their base.
Sweden, Switzerland, and Australia had separate emissions standards for many years but have since adopted the European standards.
India, China, and other newer markets have also begun enforcing vehicle emissions standards (derived from the European requirements) in the twenty-first century, as growing vehicle fleets have given rise to severe air quality problems there, too.
An emission performance standard is a limit that sets thresholds above which a different type of vehicle emissions control technology might be needed.
While emission performance standards have been used to dictate limits for conventional pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and oxides of sulphur (NOx and SOx), this regulatory technique may be used to regulate greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2).
In the US, this is given in pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (lbs.
CO2/MWhr), and kilograms CO2/MWhr elsewhere.
Since 1 January 2021, all new vehicles in ECOWAS must comply with Euro 4.
From 1 January 2024, all new vehicles in Morocco must comply with Euro 6b.
South Africa's first clean fuels programme was implemented in 2006 with the banning of lead from petrol and the reduction of sulphur levels in diesel from 3,000 parts per million (ppm) to 500ppm, along with a niche grade of 50 ppm.
The Clean Fuels 2 standard, expected to begin in 2017, includes the reduction of sulphur to 10 ppm; the lowering of benzene from 5 percent to 1 percent of volume; the reduction of aromatics from 50 percent to 35 percent of volume; and the specification of olefins at 18 percent of volume.
In Canada, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) transfers the legislative authority for regulating emissions from on-road vehicles and engines to Environment Canada from Transport Canada's Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
The Regulations align emission standards with the U.S. federal standards and apply to light-duty vehicles (e.g., passenger cars), light-duty trucks (e.g., vans, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles), heavy-duty vehicles (e.g., trucks and buses), heavy-duty engines and motorcycles.
From 1 July 2019, all new heavy vehicles must comply with EPA 07 and Euro 5.
From 1 January 2025, all new heavy vehicles must comply with EPA 10 and Euro 6.
The United States has its own set of emissions standards that all new vehicles must meet.
In the United States, emissions standards are managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
In 2014, the EPA published its "Tier 3" standards for cars, trucks and other motor vehicles, which tightened air pollution emission requirements and lowered the sulfur content in gasoline.
EPA has separate regulations for small engines, such as groundskeeping equipment.
The states must also promulgate miscellaneous emissions regulations in order to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
In December 2021 EPA issued new greenhouse gas standards for passenger cars and light trucks, effective for the 2023 vehicle model year.
Under federal law, the state of California is allowed to promulgate more stringent vehicle emissions standards (subject to EPA approval), and other states may choose to follow either the national or California standards.
California had produced air quality standards prior to EPA, with severe air quality problems in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
LA is the country's second-largest city, by population, and relies much more heavily on automobiles and has less favorable meteorological conditions than the largest and third-largest cities (New York and Chicago).
Some states have areas within the state that require emissions testing while other cities within the state do not require emission testing.
Arizona emissions testing locations are located primarily in the two largest metropolitan areas (Phoenix and Tucson).
People outside of these areas are not required to submit their vehicle for testing as these areas are the only ones that have failed the air quality tests by the state.
California's emissions standards are set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
By mid-2009, 16 other states had adopted CARB rules; given the size of the California market plus these other states, many manufacturers choose to build to the CARB standard when selling in all 50 states.
CARB's policies have also influenced EU emissions standards.
California is attempting to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, but faces a court challenge from the federal government.
The states are also attempting to compel the federal EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which as of 2007 it has declined to do.
On 19 May 2009, news reports indicate that the Federal EPA will largely adopt California's standards on greenhouse gas emissions.
California and several other western states have passed bills requiring performance-based regulation of greenhouse gases from electricity generation.
In an effort to decrease emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines faster, CARB's Carl Moyer Program funds upgrades that are in advance of regulations.
The California ARB standard for light vehicle emissions is a regulation of equipment first, with verification of emissions second.
The property owner of the vehicle is not permitted to modify, improve, or innovate solutions in order to pass a true emissions-only standard set for their vehicle driven on public highways.
Therefore, California's attempt at regulation of emissions is a regulation of equipment, not of air quality.
Vehicle owners are excluded from modifying their property in any way that has not been extensively researched and approved by CARB and still operate them on public highways.

Due to rapidly expanding wealth and prosperity, the number of coal power plants and cars on China's roads is rapidly growing, creating an ongoing pollution problem.
China enacted its first emissions controls on automobiles in 2000, equivalent to Euro I standards.
China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) upgraded emission controls again on 1 July 2004 to the Euro II standard.
More stringent emission standard, National Standard III, equivalent to Euro III standards, went into effect on 1 July 2007.
Plans were for Euro IV standards to take effect in 2010.

For new passenger cars with compression-ignition engines, they must meet US EPA Tier 2 Bin 5 standard.
The current standard is Euro 6C, it has been phased in since 2019.
Bharat stage emission standards are emission standards instituted by the Government of India to regulate the output of air pollutants from internal combustion engine equipment, including motor vehicles.
The standards and the timeline for implementation are set by the Central Pollution Control Board under the Ministry of Environment & Forests.
The standards, based on European regulations were first introduced in 2000.
Progressively stringent norms have been rolled out since then.
All new vehicles manufactured after the implementation of the norms have to be compliant with the regulations.
By 2014, the country was under a combination of Euro 3 and Euro 4-based norms, with Euro 4 standards partly implemented in 13 major cities.
Till April 2017, the entire country was under BS IV norms, which is based on Euro 4.
As of now manufacturing and registration of BS VI vehicles has started, from April 2020 all BS VI manufacturing is mandatory, respectively.
Starting 10 June 1968, the Japanese Government passed the Air Pollution Control Act which regulated all sources of air pollutants.
As a result of the 1968 law, dispute resolutions were passed under the 1970 Air Pollution Dispute Resolution Act.
As a result of the 1970 law, in 1973 the first installment of four sets of new emissions standards were introduced.
Interim standards were introduced on 1 January 1975, and again for 1976.
The final set of standards were introduced for 1978.
While the standards were introduced they were not made immediately mandatory, instead tax breaks were offered for cars which passed them.
The standards were based on those adopted by the original US Clean Air Act of 1970, but the test cycle included more slow city driving to correctly reflect the Japanese situation.
The 1978 limits for mean emissions during a "Hot Start Test" of CO, hydrocarbons, and NOx were 2.1 grams per kilometre (3.38 g/mi) of CO, 0.25 grams per kilometre (0.40 g/mi) of HC, and 0.25 grams per kilometre (0.40 g/mi) of NOx respectively.
Maximum limits are 2.7 grams per kilometre (4.35 g/mi) of CO, 0.39 grams per kilometre (0.63 g/mi) of HC, and 0.48 grams per kilometre (0.77 g/mi) of NOx.
One interesting detail of the Japanese emissions standards was that they were introduced in a soft manner; that is, 1978 model year cars could be sold that did not meet the 1978 standards, but they would suffer various tax penalties.
This gave manufacturers breathing room to properly engineer solutions and also incentivized fixing the best-selling models first, leading to smoother adoption of clean air standards and fewer drivability concerns than in many other markets.
The "10 - 15 Mode Hot Cycle" test, used to determine individual fuel economy ratings and emissions observed from the vehicle being tested, use a specific testing regime.
In 1992, to cope with NOx pollution problems from existing vehicle fleets in highly populated metropolitan areas, the Ministry of the Environment adopted the Law Concerning Special Measures to Reduce the Total Amount of Nitrogen Oxides Emitted from Motor Vehicles in Specified Areas, called in short The Motor Vehicle NOx Law.
The regulation designated a total of 196 communities in the Tokyo, Saitama, Kanagawa, Osaka and Hyogo Prefectures as areas with significant air pollution due to nitrogen oxides emitted from motor vehicles.
Under the Law, several measures had to be taken to control NOx from in-use vehicles, including enforcing emission standards for specified vehicle categories.
The regulation was amended in June 2001 to tighten the existing NOx requirements and to add PM control provisions.
The amended rule is called the "Law Concerning Special Measures to Reduce the Total Amount of Nitrogen Oxides and Particulate Matter Emitted from Motor Vehicles in Specified Areas", or in short the Automotive NOx and PM Law.
The NOx and PM Law introduces emission standards for specified categories of in-use highway vehicles including commercial goods (cargo) vehicles such as trucks and vans, buses, and special purpose motor vehicles, irrespective of the fuel type.
The regulation also applies to diesel powered passenger cars (but not to gasoline cars).
Furthermore, the regulation allows fulfillment of its requirements to be postponed by an additional 0.5–2.5 years, depending on the age of the vehicle.
This delay was introduced in part to harmonize the NOx and PM Law with the Tokyo diesel retrofit program.
The NOx and PM Law is enforced in connection with Japanese vehicle inspection program, where non-complying vehicles cannot undergo the inspection in the designated areas.
This, in turn, may trigger an injunction on the vehicle operation under the Road Transport Vehicle Law.

From 1 January 2024, all new vehicles in Thailand must comply with Euro 5.
Diesel and gasoline sulphur content is regulated at 10 ppm.
Turkey currently follows Euro VI for heavy duty commercial vehicles, and, in 2016 a couple of years after the EU, Turkey adopted Euro 6 for new types of light duty vehicles (LDV) and new types of passenger cars.
Turkey is planning to use the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure (WLTP).
However, despite these tailpipe emission standards for new vehicle types there are many older diesel vehicles, no low-emission zones and no national limit on PM2.5 particulates so local pollution, including from older vehicles, is still a major health risk in some cities, such as Ankara.
Concentrations of PM2.5 are 41 μg/m3 in Turkey, making it the country with the worst air pollution in Europe.
The regulation for testing of existing vehicle exhaust gases is Official Newspaper number 30004 published 11 March 2017.
An average of 135 g CO2/km for LDVs compared well with other countries in 2015, however unlike the EU there is no limit on carbon dioxide emissions.
From 1 January 2022, all new cars in Vietnam must comply with Euro 5.
Before the European Union began streamlining emissions standards, there were several different sets of rules.
Members of the European Economic Community (EEC) had a unified set of rules, considerably laxer than those of the United States or Japan.
These were tightened gradually, beginning on cars of over two liters displacement as the price increase would have less of an impact in this segment.
The ECE 15/05 norms (also known as the Luxemburg accord, strict enough to essentially require catalytic converters) began taking effect gradually: the initial step applied to cars of over 2000 cc in two stages, in October 1988 and October 1989.
There followed cars between 1.4 and 2.0 liters, in October 1991 and then October 1993.
Cars of under 1400 cc had to meet two subsequent sets of regulations that applied in October 1992 and October 1994 respectively.
French and Italian car manufacturers, strongly represented in the small car category, had been lobbying heavily against these regulations throughout the 1980s.
Within the EEC, Germany was a leader in regulating automobile emissions.
Germany gave financial incentives to buyers of cars that met US or ECE standards, with lesser credits available to those that partially fulfilled the requirements.
These incentives had a strong impact; only 6.5 percent of new cars registered in Germany in 1988 did not meet any emissions requirements and 67.3 percent were compliant with the strictest US or ECE standards.
Sweden was one of the first countries to instill stricter rules (for 1975), placing severe limitations on the number of vehicles available there.
These standards also caused drivability problems and steeply increased fuel consumption - in part because manufacturers could not justify the expenditure to meet specific regulations that applied only in one very small market.
In 1982, the European Community calculated that the Swedish standards increased fuel consumption by 9 percent, while it made cars 2.5 percent more expensive.
For 1983 Switzerland (and then Australia) joined in the same set of regulations, which gradually increased the number of certified engines.
One problem with the strict standards was that they did not account for catalyzed engines, meaning that vehicles thus equipped had to have the catalytic converters removed before they could be legally registered.
In 1985 the first catalyzed cars entered certain European markets such as Germany.
At first, the availability of unleaded petrol was limited and sales were small.
In Sweden, catalyzed vehicles became allowed in 1987, benefitting from a tax rebate to boost sales.
By 1989 the Swiss/Swedish emissions rules were tightened to the point that non-catalyzed cars were no longer able to be sold.
In early 1989 the BMW Z1 was introduced, only available with catalyzed engines.
This was a problem in some places like Portugal, where unleaded fuel was still almost non-existent, although European standards required unleaded gasoline to be "available" in every country by 1 October 1989.
The main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union is transportation.
In 2019, it contributes to about 31% of global emissions and 24% of emissions in the EU.
In addition, up to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions have only increased in the transport economic sector.
In 2019, about 95% of the fuel came from fossil sources.
The European Union has its own set of emissions standards that all new vehicles must meet.
Currently, standards are set for all road vehicles, trains, barges and 'nonroad mobile machinery' (such as tractors).
No standards apply to seagoing ships or airplanes.
EU Regulation No 443/2009 set an average CO2 emissions target for new passenger cars of 130 grams per kilometre.
The target was gradually phased in between 2012 and 2015.
A target of 95 grams per kilometre applies from 2021.
For light commercial vehicle, an emissions target of 175 g/km applies from 2017, and 147 g/km from 2020, a reduction of 16%.
The EU introduced Euro 4 effective 1 January 2008, Euro 5 effective 1 January 2010, and Euro 6 effective 1 January 2014.
These dates had been postponed for two years to give oil refineries the opportunity to modernize their plants.
From January 2022, all new light vehicles must comply with Euro 6d.
From 1 January 2023, all new motorcycles must comply with Euro 5.
According to the German federal automotive office 37.3% (15.4 million) cars in Germany (total car population 41.3 million) conform to the Euro 4 standard from Jan 2009.
All new light vehicles must comply with Euro 5 since January 2016.
All new heavy vehicles must comply with Euro 5 since 2018.
Several local authorities in the UK have introduced Euro 4 or Euro 5 emissions standards for taxis and licensed private hire vehicles to operate in their area.
Emissions tests on diesel cars have not been carried out during MOTs in Northern Ireland for 12 years, despite being legally required.
From January 2022, all new light vehicles must comply with Euro 6d.
From 1 January 2023, all new motorcycles must comply with Euro 5.
Australian noxious emission standards are based on European regulations for light-duty and heavy-duty (heavy goods) vehicles, with acceptance of selected US and Japanese standards.
The current policy is to fully harmonize Australian regulations with United Nations (UN) and Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) standards.
In November 2013, the first stage of the stringent Euro 5 emission standards for light vehicles was introduced, which includes cars and light commercial vehicles.
The development of emission standards for highway vehicles and engines is coordinated by the National Transport Commission (NTC) and the regulations—Australian Design Rules (ADR)—are administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport.
All new vehicles manufactured or sold in the country must comply with the standards, which are tested by running the vehicle or engine in a standardized test cycle.
In April 2023, the Australian government released its National Electric Vehicle Strategy, which included a commitment to introduce a Fuel Efficiency Standard to address greenhouse gas emissions.
The government undertook consultation on the model for the standard in April and May 2023, and they intend to introduce legislation by the end of 2023  Research commissioned by environmental NGO Solar Citizens has calculated that a Fuel Efficiency Standard that started at 95g CO2/km and reduced to 0g CO2/km over ten years would save Australian motorists $11b over the first five years.
From December 2025, all new vehicles sold in Australia will have to comply with Euro 6d.
A vehicle frame, also historically known as its chassis, is the main supporting structure of a motor vehicle to which all other components are attached, comparable to the skeleton of an organism.
Nearly all trucks, buses, and most pickups continue to use a separate frame as their chassis.
Weight of the body, passengers, and cargo loads.
Typically, the material used to construct vehicle chassis and frames include carbon steel for strength or aluminum alloys to achieve a more lightweight construction.
In the case of a separate chassis, the frame is made up of structural elements called the rails or beams.
These are ordinarily made of steel channel sections by folding, rolling, or pressing steel plate.
There are three main designs for these.
If the material is folded twice, an open-ended cross-section, either C-shaped or hat-shaped (U-shaped), results.
"Boxed" frames contain closed chassis rails, either by welding them up or by using premanufactured metal tubing.
By far the most common, the C-channel rail has been used on nearly every type of vehicle at one time or another.
It is made by taking a flat piece of steel (usually ranging in thickness from 1/8" to 3/16", but up to 1/2" or more in some heavy-duty trucks) and rolling both sides over to form a C-shaped beam running the length of the vehicle.
C-channel is typically more flexible than (fully) boxed of the same gauge.
Hat frames resemble a "U" and may be either right-side-up or inverted, with the open area facing down.
They are not commonly used due to weakness and a propensity to rust.
However, they can be found on 1936–1954 Chevrolet cars and some Studebakers.
Abandoned for a while, the hat frame regained popularity when companies started welding it to the bottom of unibody cars, effectively creating a boxed frame.
Originally, boxed frames were made by welding two matching C-rails together to form a rectangular tube.
Modern techniques, however, use a process similar to making C-rails in that a piece of steel is bent into four sides and then welded where both ends meet.
In the 1960s, the boxed frames of conventional American cars were spot-welded in multiple places down the seam; when turned into NASCAR "stock car" racers, the box was continuously welded from end to end for extra strength.
While appearing at first glance as a simple form made of metal, frames encounter significant stress and are built accordingly.
The first issue addressed is "beam height", or the height of the vertical side of a frame.
The taller the frame, the better it can resist vertical flex when force is applied to the top of the frame.
This is the reason semi-trucks have taller frame rails than other vehicles instead of just being thicker.
As looks, ride quality, and handling became more important to consumers, new shapes were incorporated into frames.
The most visible of these are arches and kick-ups.
Instead of running straight over both axles, arched frames sit lower—roughly level with their axles—and curve up over the axles and then back down on the other side for bumper placement.
Kick-ups do the same thing without curving down on the other side and are more common on the front ends.
Another feature are the tapered rails that narrow vertically or horizontally in front of a vehicle's cabin.
This is done mainly on trucks to save weight and slightly increase room for the engine since the front of the vehicle does not bear as much load as the back.
Design developments include frames that use multiple shapes in the same frame rail.
For example, some pickup trucks have a boxed frame in front of the cab, shorter, narrower rails underneath the cab, and regular C-rails under the bed.
On perimeter frames, the areas where the rails connect from front to center and center to rear are weak compared to regular frames, so that section is boxed in, creating what are called "torque boxes".
Named for its resemblance to a ladder, the ladder frame is one of the oldest, simplest, and most frequently used under-body, separate chassis/frame designs.
It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels, running the length of the vehicle, connected by several transverse cross-members.
Initially seen on almost all vehicles, the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and unitized body construction.
It is now seen mainly on large trucks.
This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular cross-members are used.
The vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the floor pan sitting above the frame instead of inside it.
A backbone chassis is a type of automotive construction with chassis that is similar to the body-on-frame design.
Instead of a relatively flat, ladder-like structure with two longitudinal, parallel frame rails, it consists of a central, strong tubular backbone (usually rectangular in cross-section) that carries the power-train and connects the front and rear suspension attachment structures.
Although the backbone is frequently drawn upward into, and mostly above the floor of the vehicle, the body is still placed on or over (sometimes straddling) this structure from above.
This is the design used for the full-size American models of General Motors in the late 1950s and early 1960s in which the rails from alongside the engine seemed to cross in the passenger compartment, each continuing to the opposite end of the crossmember at the extreme rear of the vehicle.
It was specifically chosen to decrease the overall height of the vehicles regardless of the increase in the size of the transmission and propeller shaft humps since each row had to cover frame rails as well.
Several models had the differential located not by the customary bar between axle and frame, but by a ball joint atop the differential connected to a socket in a wishbone hinged onto a crossmember of the frame.
The X-frame was claimed to improve on previous designs, but it lacked side rails and thus did not provide adequate side impact and collision protection.
Perimeter frames replaced this design.
Similar to a ladder frame, but the middle sections of the frame rails sit outboard of the front and rear rails, routed around the passenger footwells, inside the rocker and sill panels.
This allowed the floor pan to be lowered, especially the passenger footwells, lowering the passengers' seating height and thereby reducing both the roof-line and overall vehicle height, as well as the center of gravity, thus improving handling and road-holding in passenger cars.
The Ford Panther platform, discontinued in 2011, was one of the last perimeter frame passenger car platforms in the United States.
The fourth to seventh generation Chevrolet Corvette used a perimeter frame integrated with an internal skeleton that serves as a clamshell.
In addition to a lowered roof, the perimeter frame allows lower seating positions when that is desirable, and offers better safety in the event of a side impact.
However, the design lacks stiffness because the transition areas from front to center and center to rear reduce beam and torsional resistance and is used in combination with torque boxes and soft suspension settings.
This is a modification of the perimeter frame, or of the backbone frame, in which the passenger compartment floor, and sometimes the luggage compartment floor, have been integrated into the frame as loadbearing parts for strength and rigidity.
The sheet metal used to assemble the components needs to be stamped with ridges and hollows to give it strength.
Platform chassis were used on several successful European cars, most notably the Volkswagen Beetle, where it was called "body-on-pan" construction.
Another German example are the Mercedes-Benz "Ponton" cars of the 1950s and 1960s, where it was called a "frame floor" in English-language advertisements.
The French Renault 4, of which over eight million were made, also used a platform frame.
The frame of the Citroën 2CV used a minimal interpretation of a platform chassis under its body.
In a (tubular) spaceframe chassis, the suspension, engine, and body panels are attached to a three-dimensional skeletal frame of tubes, and the body panels have limited or no structural function.
To maximize rigidity and minimize weight, the design frequently makes maximum use of triangles, and all the forces in each strut are either tensile or compressive, never bending, so they can be kept as thin as possible.
The first true spaceframe chassis were produced in the 1930s by Buckminster Fuller and William Bushnell Stout (the Dymaxion and the Stout Scarab) who understood the theory of the true spaceframe from either architecture or aircraft design.
The 1951 Jaguar C-Type racing sports car utilized a lightweight, multi-tubular, triangulated frame over which an aerodynamic aluminum body was crafted.
In 1994, the Audi A8 was the first mass-market car with an aluminium chassis, made feasible by integrating an aluminium space-frame into the bodywork.
Audi A8 models have since used this construction method co-developed with Alcoa, and marketed as the Audi Space Frame.
The Italian term Superleggera (meaning 'super-light') was trademarked by Carrozzeria Touring for lightweight sports-car body construction that only resembles a space-frame chassis.
Using a three-dimensional frame that consists of a cage of narrow tubes that, besides being under the body, run up the fenders and over the radiator, cowl, and roof, and under the rear window, it resembles a geodesic structure.
A skin is attached to the outside of the frame, often made of aluminum.
This body construction is, however, not stress-bearing and still requires the addition of a chassis.
A type of body/frame construction in which the body of the vehicle, its floor plan and chassis form a single structure.
Such a design is generally lighter and more rigid than a vehicle having a separate body and frame.
Integral frame and body construction requires more than simply welding an unstressed body to a conventional frame.
In a fully integrated body structure, the entire car is a load-carrying unit that handles all the loads experienced by the vehicle – forces from driving and cargo loads.
Integral-type bodies for wheeled vehicles are typically manufactured by welding preformed metal panels and other components together, by forming or casting whole sections as one piece, or by combining these techniques.
Although this is sometimes also referred to as a monocoque structure, because the car's outer skin and panels are made load-bearing, there are still ribs, bulkheads, and box sections to reinforce the body, making the description semi-monocoque more appropriate.
The first attempt to develop such a design technique was on the 1922 Lancia Lambda to provide structural stiffness and a lower body height for its torpedo car body.
The Lambda had an open layout with unstressed roof, which made it less of a monocoque shell and more like a bowl.
One thousand were produced.
In 1930, Joseph Ledwinka, an engineer with Budd, designed an automobile prototype with a full unitary construction.
Citroën purchased this fully unitary body design for the Citroën Traction Avant.
This high-volume, mass-production car was introduced in 1934 and sold 760,000 units over the next 23 years of production.
This application was the first iteration of the modern structural integration of body and chassis, using spot welded deeply stamped steel sheets into a structural cage, including sills, pillars, and roof beams.
In addition to a unitary body with no separate frame, the Traction Avant also featured other innovations such as front-wheel drive.
The result was a low-slung vehicle with an open, flat-floored interior.
For the Chrysler Airflow (1934–1937), Budd supplied a variation – three main sections from the Airflow's body were welded into what Chrysler called a bridge-truss construction.
Unfortunately, this method was not ideal because the panel fits were poor.
To convince a skeptical public of the strength of unibody, both Citroën and Chrysler created advertising films showing cars surviving after being pushed off a cliff.
Opel was the second European and the first German car manufacturer to produce a car with a unibody structure – production of the compact Olympia started in 1935.
A larger Kapitän went into production in 1938, although its front longitudinal beams were stamped separately and then attached to the main body.
It was so successful that the Soviet post-war mass produced GAZ-M20 Pobeda of 1946 copied unibody structure from the Opel Kapitän.
Later Soviet limousine GAZ-12 ZIM of 1950 introduced unibody design to automobiles with a wheelbase as long as 3.2 m (126 in).
Since then, more cars were redesigned to the unibody structure, which is now "considered standard in the industry".
By 1960, the unitized body design was used by Detroit's Big Three on their compact cars (Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, and Chevrolet Corvair).
After Nash merged with Hudson Motors to form American Motors Corporation, its Rambler-badged automobiles continued exclusively building variations of the unibody.
Although the 1934 Chrysler Airflow had a weaker-than-usual frame and body framework welded to the chassis to provide stiffness, in 1960, Chrysler moved from body-on-frame construction to a unit-body design for most of its cars.
The unibody is now the preferred construction for mass-market automobiles.
This design provides weight savings, improved space utilization, and ease of manufacture.
Acceptance grew dramatically in the wake of the two energy crises of the 1970s and that of the 2000s in which compact SUVs using a truck platform (primarily the USA market) were subjected to CAFE standards after 2005 (by the late 2000s truck-based compact SUVs were phased out and replaced with crossovers).
An additional advantage of a strong-bodied car lies in the improved crash protection for its passengers.
A subframe is a distinct structural frame component, to reinforce or complement a particular section of a vehicle's structure.
Typically attached to a unibody or a monocoque, the rigid subframe can handle great forces from the engine and drive train.
It can transfer them evenly to a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a unitized body shell.
Subframes are often found at the front or rear end of cars and are used to attach the suspension to the vehicle.
A subframe may also contain the engine and transmission.
It normally has pressed or box steel construction but may be tubular and/or other material.
Examples of passenger car use include the 1967–1981 GM F platform, the numerous years and models built on the GM X platform (1962), GM's M/L platform vans (Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, which included an all-wheel drive variant), and the unibody AMC Pacer that incorporated a front subframe to isolate the passenger compartment from the engine, suspension, and steering loads.
A vehicle identification number (VIN; also called a chassis number or frame number) is a unique code, including a serial number, used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, as defined by the International Organization for Standardization in ISO 3779 (content and structure) and ISO 4030 (location and attachment).
There are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been written off.
VINs were first used in 1954 in the United States.
From 1954 to 1981, there was no accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers and even divisions within a manufacturer used different formats.
By 1966, GM had settled on a 13-digit VIN, and standardized its VIN format across its divisions in 1972.
In 1981, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States standardized the format.
It required all on-road vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN, which does not include the letters O (o), I (i), and Q (q) (to avoid confusion with numerals 0, 1, and 9).
After the introduction of the ISO norm, the manufacturers which produced vehicles for the American market very quickly adjusted to this standard.
The ISO introduced recommendations for applying the VIN standard and its structure, and the VIN was also used in Europe.
However, the sets of information contained in it were introduced gradually.
For example, Volkswagen started to encode bigger chunks of information during 1995–1997, and the control digit during 2009–2015 for selected models from the group.
The VIN control digit is also used, although not in all brand-models.
In the European vehicles, it can be found e.g. in Audi A1.
There are at least four competing standards used to calculate the VIN.
Modern VINs are based on two related standards, originally issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1979 and 1980: ISO 3779 and ISO 3780, respectively.
Compatible but different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the European Union and the United States.
The first three characters uniquely identify the manufacturer of the vehicle using the world manufacturer identifier or WMI code.
A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1,000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification.
Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both.
For example, within 1G (assigned to General Motors in the United States), 1G1 represents Chevrolet passenger cars; 1G2, Pontiac passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet trucks.
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in the US assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.
The first character of the WMI is typically the region in which the manufacturer is located although there are exceptions e.g. the WMI 7SA was assigned to Tesla Inc. in the United States in 2021.
In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of W0L because Adam Opel AG is based in Rüsselsheim, Germany).
In the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number.
For example, 8X–82 denotes the range 8X, 8Y, 8Z, 81, 82, excluding 80.
The fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS.
This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the automobile platform used, the model, and the body style.
Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field.
Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle.
Example: for the 2007 Chevrolet Corvette, U is for a 6.0-liter V8 engine, and E is for a 7.0-liter V8.
One element that is inconsistent is the use of position nine as a check digit, compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, but not Europe.
The 10th to 17th positions are used as the vehicle identifier section or VIS.
This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question.
This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number.
The North American implementation of the VIS uses the 10th digit to encode the model year of the vehicle.
Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the model year code.
Outside North America the 10th digit is usually 0.
The year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially General Motors and Chrysler, as "A" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the "A" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet Ford and AMC still used a zero for 1980.
Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that "Y" represents the year 2000.
2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as "A", "B", "C", etc.
The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.
In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10.
For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980–2009.
If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010–2039.
The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than 10,000 lb (4,500 kg), as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range.
VIN characters 1–8 and 10 that were assigned from 1980 to 2009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.
Compulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the assembly plant at which the vehicle was built.
Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.
In the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number.
This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.
A check-digit validation is used for all road vehicles sold in the United States and Canada.
When trying to validate a VIN with a check digit, first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see below) to cancel it out.
The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value.
If the calculated value is 0–9, the check digit must match the calculated value.
If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X.
If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN.
However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs 5GZCZ43D13S812715 (correct with leading five) and SGZCZ43D13S812715 (incorrect with leading character "S").
The VINs in the Porsche image, WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124, and the GM-T body image, KLATF08Y1VB363636, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.
Transliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts.
These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's EBCDIC) are in the following chart.
I, O, and Q are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with N/A (not applicable).
Numerical digits use their own values.
S is 2, and not 1.
There is no left-alignment linearity.
The following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN.
The 9th position is that of the check digit.
It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.
Consider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be the check digit.
The VIN's value is calculated from the above transliteration table.
This number is used in the rest of the calculation.
Copy the weights from the weight factor row above.
The products row is the result of the multiplication of the columns in the Value and Weight rows.
The products (8, 28, 48, 35 ... 24, 16) are all added together to yield a sum, 351.
The remainder is the check digit.
If the remainder is 10, the check digit is X.
In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as X. With a check digit of X, the VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788 is written 1M8GDM9AXKP042788.
A VIN with straight-ones (seventeen consecutive 1s) has the nice feature that its check digit 1 matches the calculated value 1.
This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder 1⁄11; thus 1 is the check digit.
This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.
The VIN is marked in multiple locations; normally in the lower corner of the windshield on the driver's side, under the bonnet next to latch, at the front end of the vehicle frame, and inside the door pillar on the driver's side.
On newer vehicles VINs may be optically read with barcode scanners or digital cameras, or digitally read via OBD-II.
There are smartphone applications that can pass the VIN to websites to decode the VIN.
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) assigns the WMI (world manufacturer identifier) to countries and manufacturers.
The following list shows a selection of world manufacturer codes.
Vehicle recycling or automobile scrapping is the dismantling of vehicles for spare parts.
At the end of their useful life, vehicles have value as a source of spare parts and this has created a vehicle dismantling industry.
The industry has various names for its business outlets including wrecking yard, auto dismantling yard, car spare parts supplier, and recently, auto or vehicle recycling.
Vehicle recycling has always occurred to some degree but in recent years manufacturers have become involved in the process.
A car crusher is often used to reduce the size of scrapped vehicles for simplified transportation to a steel mill.
Approximately 12-15 million vehicles reach the end of their useful life each year in just the United States alone.
These automobiles, although no longer roadworthy, can still have a purpose by giving back the metal and other recyclable materials that are contained in them.
The vehicles are shredded and the metal content is recovered for recycling, while in many areas, the rest is further sorted by machine for recycling of additional materials such as glass and plastics.
The remainder, known as automotive shredder residue, is put into a landfill.
The shredder residue that is not recovered for metal contains many other recyclable materials; 30% of it may be polymers, and 5-10% of it residual metals.
Modern vehicle recycling attempts to be as cost-effective as possible in recycling those residual materials.
Currently, 75% of the materials can be recycled, with the remaining 25% ending up in landfill.
As the most recycled consumer product, end-of-life vehicles provide the steel industry with more than 14 million tons of steel per year.
The process of recycling a vehicle is extremely complicated, as there are many parts to be recycled and many hazardous materials to remove.
Briefly, the process begins with incoming vehicles being inventoried for parts.
The wheels, tires, battery, and catalytic converter are removed.
Fluids, such as engine coolant, oil, transmission fluid, air conditioning refrigerant, and gasoline, are drained and removed.
Certain high value parts such as electronic modules, alternators, starter motors, infotainment systems - even complete engines or transmissions - may be removed if they are still serviceable and can be profitably sold in either "as-is" used condition or to a remanufacturer for restoration.
The high value rare-earth magnets in electric car motors are also recyclable.
This process of removing higher value parts from the lower value vehicle body shell has traditionally been done by hand.
As the process is labor intensive, it is often uneconomical to remove many of the parts.
Self-serve junkyards address this in part by having customers remove parts from vehicles themselves.
In this business model, cars often sit in a dedicated yard for anywhere from a few weeks to several months, and patrons can bring their own tools and remove any parts they want to buy.
Once a vehicle has been in the yard for a sufficient period of time, the facility will proceed with the end-of-life vehicle scrapping and recycling process.
A technique that is on the rise is the mechanical removal of these higher value parts via machine based vehicle recycling systems (VRS).
An excavator or materials handler equipped with a special attachment allows these materials to be removed quickly and efficiently.
Increasing the amount of material that is recycled and increasing the value the vehicle dismantler receives from an end-of-life vehicle (ELV).
Other hazardous materials such as mercury and sodium azide (the propellant used in air bags) may also be removed.
After all of the parts and products inside are removed, the remaining shell of the vehicle is sometimes subject to further processing, which includes removal of the air conditioner evaporator and heater core, and wiring harnesses.
The remaining shell is then crushed flat, or cubed, to facilitate economical transportation in bulk to an industrial shredder or hammer mill, where the vehicles are further reduced to fist-sized chunks of metal.
Glass, plastic and rubber are removed from the mix, and the metal is sold by multiple tons to steel mills for recycling.
Recycling steel saves energy and natural resources.
The steel industry saves enough energy to power about 18 million households for a year, on a yearly basis.
Recycling metal also uses about 74 percent less energy than making metal.
Thus, recyclers of end-of-life vehicles save an estimated 85 million barrels of oil annually that would have been used in the manufacturing of other parts.
Likewise, car recycling keeps 11 million tons of steel and 800,000 non-ferrous metals out of landfills and back in consumer use.
Before the 2003 model year, some vehicles that were manufactured were found to contain mercury auto switches, historically used in convenience lighting and antilock braking systems.
Recyclers remove and recycle this mercury before the vehicles are shredded to prevent it from escaping into the environment.
In 2007, over 2,100 pounds of mercury were collected by 6,265 recyclers.
Consumers can also financially benefit from recycling certain car parts such as tires and catalytic converters.
In 1997, the European Commission adopted a Proposal for a Directive which aims at making vehicle dismantling and recycling more environmentally friendly by setting clear targets for the recycling of vehicles.
This proposal encouraged many in Europe to consider the environmental impact of end-of-life vehicles.
In September 2000, the End of Life Vehicles Directive was officially adopted by the EP and Council.
Over the next decade, more legislation would be adopted in order to clarify legal aspects, national practices, and recommendations.
A number of vehicle manufacturers collaborated on developing the International Dismantling Information System to meet the legal obligations of the End of Life Vehicles Directive.
In 2018 the EC published a study Assessment of ELV Directive with emphasis on the end of life vehicles of unknown whereabouts.
This study demonstrates that each year the whereabouts of 3 to 4 million ELVs across the EU is unknown and that the stipulation in the ELV Directive are not sufficient to monitor the performance of single Member States for this aspect.
The study proposed and assessed a number of options to improve the legal provisions of the ELV Directive.
On 2 July 2009 and for the next 55 days, the Car Allowance Rebate System, or “Cash for Clunkers”, was an attempt at a green initiative by the United States Government in order to stimulate automobile sales and improve the average fuel economy of the United States.
Many cars ended up being destroyed and recycled in order to fulfill the program, and even some exotic cars were crushed.
Ultimately, as carbon footprints are of concern, some will argue that the “Cash for Clunkers” did not reduce many owners’ carbon footprints.
A lot of carbon dioxide is added into the atmosphere to make new cars.
It is calculated that if someone traded in an 18 mpg clunker for a 22 mpg new car, it would take five and a half years of typical driving to offset the new car's carbon footprint.
That same number increases to eight or nine years for those who bought trucks.
If a vehicle is abandoned on the roadside or in empty lots, licensed dismantlers in the United States can legally obtain them so that they are safely converted into reusable or recycled commodities.
In early 2009, a voluntary program, called Retire Your Ride, was launched by the Government of Canada to encourage motorists across the country to give up their old vehicles that emit pollutants.
A total of 50,000 vehicles manufactured in 1995 or in years prior were targeted for permanent retirement.
Recyclers offer CA$150- CA$1000 for the cars with an original catalytic converter.
However, some scrap yards pay between CA$250 to CA$20,000 for a Junk Car.
These prices are influenced by metal rates, location, make/model of the vehicle.
Between 2009–10, the United Kingdom introduced the scrappage incentive scheme that paid GBP2,000 in cash for cars registered on or before 31 August 1999.
The high payout was to help old-vehicle owners purchase new and less-polluting ones.
In the United Kingdom the term cash for cars also relates to the purchase of cars immediately for cash from car buying companies without the need of advertising.
There are however legal restrictions to level of cash that can be used within a business transaction to buy a vehicle.
The EU sets this at 10,000 euros or currency equivalent as part of its Money Laundering Regulations.
In the UK it is no longer possible to purchase scrap cars for cash with the introduction of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act in 2013.
As a result, firms in the scrap my car industry can no longer pay cash for cars.
Instead, these firms now pay by bank transfer.
In Australia, the term cash for cars is also synonymous with car removal.
Only in Victoria, companies must acquire a LMCT and other relevant processing licenses before the procurement of vehicles.
Some time it takes to check every vehicles history and After that It can be processed for wrecking and recycling purposes.
Both Cash For Cars and Car Removals services are asked for cars coming to the end of their road life.
There are certain companies who are involved in efficient and responsible vehicle recycling services in Adelaide and also pay cash for junk car. .
Compliance with regulations ensures proper management of hazardous materials and promotes sustainable practices in the industry, contributing to both environmental conservation and economic activity through the sale of recycled materials.
New Zealand motor vehicle fleet increased 61 percent from 1.5 million in 1986 to over 2.4 million by June 2003.
By 2015 it almost reached 3.9 million.
This is where scrapping has increased since 2014.
Cash For Cars is a term used for Car Removal/Scrap Car where wreckers pay cash for old/wrecked/broken vehicles depending on age/model.
These carriages are still commonly made by Amish carriage makers in the midwestern United States.
Also in the Western world, the vis-a-vis is the most common type of carriage style used to cart tourists and leisure seekers in downtown urban settings.
Passengers sit back-to-back on dos-à-dos carriages.
Vehicle size classes are series of ratings assigned to different segments of automotive vehicles for the purposes of vehicle emissions control and fuel economy calculation.
Various methods are used to classify vehicles; in North America, passenger vehicles are classified by total interior capacity while trucks are classified by gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR).
Vehicle segments in the European Union use linear measurements to describe size.
Asian vehicle classifications are a combination of dimensions and engine displacement.
Vehicle classifications of four government agencies are in use in the United States: the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA as part of their NCAP program), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the U.S. Census Bureau.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also has its own vehicle classification system that is used by most vehicle insurance companies in the U.S. EPA size classes are defined in Federal Regulation, Title 40—Protection of Environment, Section 600.315-08 "Classes of comparable automobiles".
This information is repeated in the Fuel Economy Guide.
Passenger car classes are defined based on interior volume index (the combined passenger and cargo volume) and are as follows.
Trucks classes are defined by gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR).
The administrator classifies light trucks (nonpassenger automobiles) into the following classes: Small pickup trucks, standard pickup trucks, vans, minivans, and SUVs.
Starting in the 2013 model year, SUVs are divided between small sport utility vehicles and standard sport utility vehicles.
Pickup trucks and SUVs are separated by car line on the basis of gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR).
For a product line with more than one GVWR,  the characteristic GVWR value for the product line is established by calculating the arithmetic average of all distinct GVWR values less than or equal to 8,500 pounds available for that product line.
Special purpose vehicles.
All automobiles with GVWR less than or equal to 8,500 pounds and all medium-duty passenger vehicles which possess special features and which the administrator determines are more appropriately classified separately from typical automobiles.
Unlike the EPA, which groups automobiles by interior volume, the NHTSA groups cars for NCAP testing by weight class.
Developed in the 1980s, the Federal Highway Administration 13-category classification rule set is currently used for most federal reporting requirements and that serves as the basis for most state vehicle classification systems.
The Census Bureau surveys the United States truck population.
Large truck owners (NHTSA classes 4-13) are given a standard survey, and small truck (pickups, vans, minivans, and sport utility vehicles) owners (NHTSA class 3) are given a short survey.
In the United States the government agencies consider all pickups, vans, minivans, and sport utility vehicles to be trucks for regulatory purposes, no matter what construction method is used, either unibody or body on frame.
Coupe utilities are considered pickup trucks in the U.S., not cars.
SUVs are always considered trucks, although there are some CUVs with low ground clearance which are considered station wagon or hatchback cars for regulatory purposes.
The Insurance Institute has its own crash test program and groups cars by curb weight and shadow into six classes, micro, mini, small, midsize, large and very large.
Cars are divided into six classes based on interior volume, as shown in the table below.
These classes are not defined in Canadian regulations, but by the Fuel Consumption Guide published by Natural Resources Canada.
An interior volume index is calculated from the combined passenger and trunk or cargo space.
Pickup trucks, special purpose vehicles and vans are segmented in their own respective classes.
As most Canadian cars share designs with American cars, Canada's classifications closely mirror those of the United States.
Vehicle classes for trucks are listed in On-Road Vehicle and Engine Emission Regulations (SOR/2003-2), published in Canada Gazette Part 2, Vol. 137 No. 1. Medium-duty passenger vehicle is classified as a heavy-duty vehicle that is designed primarily for the transportation of up to 12 people.
Vehicle segments in Europe do not have formal characterization or regulations.
Models segments tend to be based on comparison to well-known brand models.
For example, a car such as the Volkswagen Golf might be described as being in the Ford Focus size class, or vice versa.
The VW Polo is smaller, so it belongs one segment below the Golf, while the bigger Passat is one segment above.
The names of the segments were mentioned, but not defined, in 1999 in an EU document titled Case No COMP/M.1406 Hyundai / Kia Regulation (EEC)
No 4064/89 Merger Procedure.
Vehicle size categories for passenger vehicles for the China NCAP program as defined by the China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC) may appear similar to the European system, but are closer to the Japanese in application.
Category A (A-segment) vehicles are two-box vehicles of between 4 and 4.5 meters in length, or three-box vehicles (i.e., sedans with trunks) with engines of less than 1600 cc. Category B (B-segment) vehicles are longer than 4.5 m in length with engines of over 1600 cc.
Vehicle size classes in Japan are rather simple compared to other regions.
The classifications were established under the Japanese Government's Road Vehicle Act of 1951.
There are just three different classes defined by regulations.
The dimension regulations are enforced to exact measurements.
These standards of classification are enforced on all vehicles within the jurisdiction of Japan, and no special consideration is made for the vehicles' origination of manufacture.
The Japanese law regulates all vehicles that do not travel on railroads (traditional or maglev), or are not powered by physically contacting overhead power lines.
The law regulates vehicles that are powered by an autonomous power source.
Smaller cars are more popular in Japan due to the confined driving conditions and speed limits.
Keijidosha (light cars): Buyers of Kei cars enjoy a number of tax, registration and other benefits to encourage the purchase of these tiny vehicles (among road vehicles requiring a license only).
Regulations have been updated a number of times over the years to allow larger, more powerful cars to be developed and maintain demand as buyers become more affluent, and to improve collision protection performance.
The current regulations state that a kei car is a vehicle less than 3.4 m (11.2 ft) long, 1.48 m (4.9 ft) wide, 2 m (6.6 ft) high, with a maximum engine displacement of 660 cc (40 cu in) and maximum power of 64 PS (47 kW; 63 hp).
Extra small microcars are available with an engine size no larger than 49 cc (3.0 cu in), identified with a light blue license plate and blue text.
Small size Passenger vehicles, commonly called "5 number" vehicles in reference to their license-plate prefix.
This class is defined as limited to vehicles less than 4.7 m (15.4 ft) long, 1.7 m (5.6 ft) wide, 2 m (6.6 ft) high and with engine displacement at or under 2,000 cc (120 cu in).
Vans, trucks and station wagons (considered commercial vehicles in Japan) in the compact size class receive a "4 number" license prefix.
Before 1989, the annual tax rate of normal-size class was more than doubled of this class so that most Japanese cars were built within small-size class requirement.
Now the annual tax rate only varies with engine displacement however useful small-size class cars are still popular in Japanese market, and Japanese manufacturers make regular improvements to compact sized products to maximize interior accommodation while remaining within the exterior boundaries.
Normal-size passenger vehicles, commonly called "3 number" in reference to their license-plate prefix (trucks and buses over 2000 cc have license plates numbers beginning with 1 and 2 respectively), are those more than 4.7 m (15.4 ft) long, 1.7 m (5.6 ft) wide, 2 m (6.6 ft) high or with engine displacement larger than 2,000 cc (120 cu in).
This regulation also mandates that passenger vehicles for private use may not exceed 6 m (19.7 ft) length or 2 m (6.6 ft) width.
Based on market conditions, vehicles such as the first generation Honda Legend (shorter and narrower V6Gi and V6Zi variants with a 2.0 V6 engine), and the Mitsubishi Starion were produced in both "compact size" (just under 4.7 m long and 1.7 m wide) for the Japanese market, and longer or wider "passenger size" versions, primarily for export.
Engine size must be at or less than 50 cc, identified by blue text and white extra small license plate.
Engine size is between 50–90 cc, identified by blue text and yellow extra small license plate.
Engine size is between 125–250 cc, identified by green text and white small license plate.
Engine size is between 250–400 cc, identified by green outline and green text with white small license plate.
Engine size is over 400 cc, identified by green outline and green text with white small license plate.
All vehicles with an engine displacement over 250 cc are required to undergo an inspection (called "Shaken" in Japan).
Vehicle weight tax and mandatory vehicle insurance are usually paid at this time.
This is separate from the road tax paid yearly.
The road tax varies from ¥3,000 for kei cars up to ¥22,000 for normal size cars with 4.6L engines.
SUV (includes crossover SUVs) size, exterior vehicle length (excluding rear mounted spare wheel/tyre) multiplied by exterior vehicle width (excluding mirrors), both in millimetres.
A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930.
Such enthusiasts have categorization schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage cars, classic cars, and so on.
The classification criteria vary, but consensus within any country is often maintained by major car clubs, for example the Vintage Sports-Car Club (VSCC) in the UK.
The vintage era in the automotive world was a time of transition.
The car started off in 1919 as still something of a rarity, and ended up, in 1930, well on the way towards ubiquity.
In fact, automobile production at the end of this period was not matched again until the 1950s.
In the intervening years, most industrialized countries built nationwide road systems with the result that, towards the end of the period, the ability to negotiate unpaved roads was no longer a prime consideration of automotive design.
Cars became much more practical, convenient and comfortable during this period.
Car heating was introduced (progressing from hot bricks via double-skinned exhaust manifolds to the heater radiator matrix), as was the in-car radio.
Four-wheel braking from a common foot pedal was introduced, as was the use of hydraulically actuated brakes.
Towards the end of the vintage era, the system of octane rating of fuel was introduced, allowing comparison between fuels.
In 1923 the gasoline additive tetraethyl lead made its debut at the Indy 500 that resulted in a boost in octane from the 1950s to the 1980s In the United States drive-in restaurants were introduced as well as suburban shopping centers and motels.
Alfred P. Sloan and Harley Earl of General Motors, and Walter P. Chrysler capitalized on advertising the automobile's role in the life of the consumer for more than just the utilitarian value compared with the horse.
The stock market crash of 1929 started the layoff of automotive workers and many new companies went bankrupt but over two million cars were still produced in 1929 and 1930.
The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 was the first federal highway act.
War and lack of funding hampered any positive results of this act.
The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act) started a 50/50 matching fund to states for road building and resulted in the creation of new and improved roads.
During this period as well as the car adapting to society, there were better roads, and society began to adapt to the car.
Dwight D. Eisenhower participated in the highly publicized Transcontinental Motor Convoy in 1919 and after becoming President the experience influenced the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 that included 41,000 miles of highways.
The end of World War I brought about the "Depression of 1920–1921" with an inflation rate of over 20 percent, a 7 percent Federal Bank discount loan rate, and an 11.7 percent unemployment rate, that resulted in many companies going bankrupt and the automotive industry was decimated.
From 1919 to 1929, many dramatic changes took place.
General Motors went into a financial crisis that lasted until after Alfred Sloan became president in 1923.
Hudson produced the Essex in 1919 that, by 1925, had propelled the company to third in total sales behind Ford and Chevrolet.
Ford was in the process of building a new plant, buying back stock, and began an 18-month process of tooling-up to replace the Model T with the Model A in 1927.
In 1921 Maxwell failed and Walter P. Chrysler, formerly of General Motors, was brought in to reorganize it and, in 1925, the Chrysler Corporation was formed.
With Ford out for a period, Chrysler was able to produce and market the low-priced Plymouth in 1928, and bought out the Dodge Brothers, also in 1928, resulting in "The Big Three" in the United States.
There were other automakers that made it past the 1920-1921 depression only to fail during the Great Depression.
During the Great Depression, in Britain many small companies started in the post World War I boom failed or merged leaving six major manufacturers: Morris, Austin, Standard, Singer, Ford of Britain, and General Motors Vauxhall.
A similar boom-and-bust cycle was seen in mainland Europe.
Antique automobiles and early to middle era classic cars do not have the safety features that are standard on modern cars.
The most rudimentary of safety features, front wheel brakes and hydraulic brakes, began appearing on cars in the 1920s and 1930s respectively.
For the average person car collecting is a hobby.
A person can have a fascination with a certain vehicle, make or a history with one so seeks a particular make or model.
Finding such a car at an affordable price is not always hard but the price will depend on the condition or the desired end result.
Usually the less work required on a vehicle equates to a higher price, the more work required means a cheaper initial cost, but often more in the long run, and a person's level of restoration experience plays an important part.
Comedian and avid car collector Jay Leno stated, "Any car can be a collector car, if you collect it."
Car collecting as an investment can be rewarding but most serious investment collectors seek rare or exotic cars and original unmodified cars hold a more stable price.
Collecting as an investment requires expertise beyond enthusiast collecting and the standard of quality is far higher as well as a need for investment protection such as storage and maintenance.
A short-term investment collector must be able to find a vehicle that has market value that is expected to rise in the foreseeable near future.
A long-term investment collector would be less interested in any short-term value seeking to capitalize on an expected value rise over a period of years and a vehicle must have certain intrinsic values that are common to other investors or collectors of both short and long term.
Cars that were made in small numbers or often have a higher value but can be more difficult to maintain.
Certain year and model cars became popular to turn into hot rods thus destroying their original condition.
Other models were produced in such quantities that the price is still not inflated.
Market trend is an important part in the price of a vintage car.
An "almost" original and in perfect shape model A that was abundantly produced can be purchased for $20,000.00.
A collector as an investor would have to know the potential market and have a belief that the future market will bring a return on an investment.
Determining the value of a vintage car can be difficult, as there are many different factors that can potentially influence the price.
The age, condition, rarity, modifications, vehicle history and mileage can all drastically change a car's value, among other observable factors such as body type, drivetrain and engine capacity.
In recent years, services have begun providing classic and vintage car valuation data to the public, by establishing baseline prices for vehicles in various conditions and publishing marketing trends and forecasts collectors can use to monitor the state of the market.
As a result of the variability in car values, most insurers offer Agreed Value insurance coverage for classic cars.
Agreed Value coverage involves both the owner and insurance company agreeing on the car's value and insuring it for the agreed amount.
This differs from the Actual Cash Value claim settlement method used in traditional auto insurance policies, which determines the claim value of the vehicle after a "total loss" or vehicle theft occurs.
Category I, Perfect; 90 to 100 points.
A vehicle is considered as good or better than the day produced.
Category II, Excellent; 80 to 89 points.
A vehicle in excellent original or superior restored, near-flawless condition.
Category III, Fine; 70 to 79 points.
A vehicle with an older restoration or an original car with minimal wear.
These are considered "show quality".
Category IV, Very good; 60 to 69 points.
A vehicle that is in complete original condition, or possibly an older restoration, that is usually a well-cared-for daily driver.
Category V, Good; 50 to 59 points.
A vehicle that shows wear, needs attention or work, and needs only minor restoration, with no major flaws.
Points from 40 to 59 fall into this category.
Category VI, Driver; 40 to 49 points.
Restorable; 30 to 39 points.
This vehicle would be in need of restoration of the motor, body, interior and/or chassis.
A car in this class should be more or less complete, needing some parts but requiring a tremendous amount of work to get to show quality.
Partial; 20 to 29 points.
This vehicle would require extensive restoration with a significant number of parts and amount of labor—a very time-consuming and costly prospect.
Parts car; 10 to 19 points.
This would generally be an inoperative vehicle in poor condition, kept as a source or 'donor' of spare parts.
With the exception of very rare vehicles, complete restoration of this category is usually not feasible.
If a car is older than a certain age, a vintage car can be approved for an antique vehicle registration.
A voiturette is a miniature automobile.
Voiturette was first registered by Léon Bollée in 1895 to name his new motor tricycle.
The term became so popular in the early years of the motor industry that it was used by many makers to describe their small cars.
The word comes from the French word for "automobile", voiture.
Between World War I and World War II light-weight racing cars with engines limited to 1500 cc such as the Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta, the Bugatti Type 13 and the original ERAs were known as voiturettes.
In France, in the years after World War II a type of small three-wheeled vehicle voiturette was produced.
In 1990s, voiturette became a French classification for a vehicle weighing less than 350 kilograms (770 lb) empty and carrying a load (i.e. passengers) of not more than 200 kilograms (~440 lb).
The top speed is limited to 45 km/h (~30 mph) and engine size to 50 cc or 4 kilowatts for an engine of "another type" for example an electric car.
Such vehicles are sometimes also called "motor quadricycles" or "motor tricycles".
The driver's license for them is available to people over 16 years and is in category "B1" and is valid, subject to restrictions, in all European Union countries.
French maker Renault's first car was simply called Voiturette, instead of the common usage then (it would have been called Renault 1¾ CV).
The 1900 model (Voiturette C) was considered the first ever sedan (a car with roof).
A W engine is a type of piston engine where three or four cylinder banks use the same crankshaft, resembling the letter W when viewed from the front.
W engines with three banks of cylinders are also called "broad arrow" engines, due to their shape resembling the British government broad arrow property mark.
W engines are less common than V engines.
Compared with a V engine, a W engine is typically shorter and wider.
One of the first W engines was the Anzani 3-cylinder, built in 1906, to be used in Anzani motorcycles.
It is this W3 engine which also powered the 1909 Blériot XI, the first airplane to fly across the English Channel.
The Feuling W3 is a 2.5 L (153 cu in) motorcycle engine that was built by an aftermarket parts company in the United States in the early 2000s.
Like radial aircraft engines it has a master connecting rod and two slave rods connected to the pistons.
The Rumpler Tropfenwagen had a Siemens and Halske-built 2,580 cc (157 cu in) overhead valve W6 engine, with three banks of paired cylinders, all working on a common crankshaft.
The sole W8 engine to reach production is the Volkswagen Group W8 engine automotive engine, which used a four-bank design and was produced from 2001-2004.
W12 engines with three banks of four cylinders were used by several aircraft engines from 1917 until the 1930s.
A three-bank W12 design was also used unsuccessfully by the Life F1 team in the 1990 Formula One season, failing to qualify at every race.
Although less commonly used in automobiles than V12 engines, a W12 petrol engine has been produced by Volkswagen Group since 2001.
This four-bank engine—based on two VR6 engines with a common crankshaft—has been used in various cars sold under the Audi, Bentley and Volkswagen brands.
W16 engines are rarely produced, with the notable exception of the Volkswagen Group 8.0
WR16 engine that has been used since 2005.
The W16 type of engine can also be found in the Bugatti Veyron, Chiron, Divo and their related models.
The W18 layout is rarely used, with the only production examples being several aircraft during the 1920s and 1930s, and CRM Motori SpA marine engines.
The Allison V-3420, manufactured by the Allison Engine Company, is an example of a W24 engine.
The Chrysler A57 multibank, essentially five 250.6 cu in (4.1 L) Chrysler flathead engines driving one output shaft through a gear train, saw action during World War II.
Developed in 1941, it would be used inside variants of the M3 Lee and M4 Sherman tanks, all deployed on the Western Front.
The A57 is the only example of a five-bank W configuration.
A wagon or waggon is a heavy four-wheeled vehicle pulled by draught animals or on occasion by humans, used for transporting goods, commodities, agricultural materials, supplies and sometimes people.
Wagons are immediately distinguished from carts (which have two wheels) and from lighter four-wheeled vehicles primarily for carrying people, such as carriages.
Animals such as horses, mules, or oxen usually pull wagons.
One animal or several, often in pairs or teams may pull wagons.
However, there are examples of human-propelled wagons, such as mining corfs.
A wagon was formerly called a wain and one who builds or repairs wagons is a wainwright.
More specifically, a wain is a type of horse- or oxen-drawn, load-carrying vehicle, used for agricultural purposes rather than transporting people.
A wagon or cart, usually four-wheeled; for example, a haywain, normally has four wheels, but the term has now acquired slightly poetical connotations, so is not always used with technical correctness.
However, a two-wheeled "haywain" would be a hay cart, as opposed to a carriage.
Wain is also an archaic term for a chariot.
Wain can also be a verb, to carry or deliver, and has other meanings.
Contemporary or modern animal-drawn wagons may be of metal instead of wood and have regular wheels with rubber tires instead of traditional wagon wheels.
A person who drives wagons is called a "wagoner", a "teamster", a "bullocky" (Australia), a "muleteer", or simply a "driver".
Wagons have served numerous purposes, with numerous corresponding designs.
As with motorized vehicles, some are designed to serve as many functions as possible, while others are highly specialized.
A front axle assembly, in its simplest form, is an assembly of a short beam with a pivot plate, two wagon wheels and spindles as well as a drawbar attached to this.
A pin attaches the device to a chariot, a wagon or a coach, making the turning radius smaller.
Farm wagons are built for general multi-purpose usage in an agricultural or rural setting.
These include gathering hay, crops and wood, and delivering them to the farmstead or market.
Wagons can also be pulled with tractors for easy transportation of those materials.
A common form found throughout Europe is the ladder wagon, a large wagon the sides of which often consisted of ladders strapped in place to hold in hay or grain, though these could be removed to serve other needs.
A common type of farm wagon particular to North America is the buckboard.
Freight wagons are used for the overland hauling of freight and bulk commodities.
In the United States and Canada, the large, heavily built Conestoga wagon was a predominant form of freight wagon in the late 18th and 19th centuries, often used for hauling goods on the Great Wagon Road in the Appalachian Valley and across the Appalachian Mountains.
Even larger wagons were built, such as the twenty-mule team wagons, used for hauling borax from Death Valley, which could haul 36 short tons (32 long tons; 33 t) per pair.
The wagons' bodies were 16 feet (4.88 m) long and 6 feet (1.83 m) deep; the rear wheels were 7 feet (2.13 m) in diameter, and the wagons weighed 7,800 pounds (3,500 kg) empty.
Freight wagons were designed for hauling loads, not people, and were not built for comfort.
In many cases there was no driver's seat or bench, leaving the driver to walk alongside the wagon or ride atop of one of the horses.
As a result, many freight wagons had a "lazyboard," a plank that could be pulled out for sitting upon then pushed back when not needed.
In America, lazyboards were located on the left side and close to the brake because carts were steered from the left side; the opposite was practiced in Great Britain.
A delivery wagon was used to deliver merchandise such as milk, bread, produce, meat and ice to residential and commercial customers, predominantly in urban settings.
The concept of express wagons and of paneled delivery vans developed in the 19th century.: 
441–5  By the end of the 19th century, delivery wagons were often finely painted, lettered and varnished, serving as image-builders and rolling advertisements.
Special forms of delivery wagon include an ice wagon and a milk wagon.
In the city center of Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany, since 1992 the city's plants are irrigated using a horse-drawn wagon with a water tank.
Wagons have also served as the first mobile homes, as mobile workshops, and mobile kitchens.
Travelling circuses decorated their wagons to be able to take part in the grand parade—even packing wagons for equipment, animal cage wagons, living vans and band wagons.: 45  Popular in North America was, and still is, the float or show wagon, driven by six horses pulling a highly decorated show wagon with a token payload, and heavily painted with company or owner advertising.: 1  Horse-drawn wagons are popular attractions at tourist destinations for leisurely sightseeing.
During the transition to mechanized vehicles from animal-powered, vehicles were built by coachbuilders and the bodies and undercarriages were substantially similar to the horse-drawn vehicles.
In modern times, the term station wagon survives as a type of automobile.
It describes a car with a passenger compartment that extends to the back of the vehicle, that has no trunk, that has one or more rear seats that can be folded making space for carrying cargo, as well as featuring an opening tailgate or liftgate.
In migration and military settings, wagons were often found in large groups called wagon trains.
In warfare, large groups of supply wagons were used to support traveling armies with food and munitions, forming "baggage trains".
During the American Civil War, these wagon trains would often be accompanied by the wagons of private merchants, known as sutlers, who sold goods to soldiers, as well as the wagons of photographers and news reporters.
Special purpose-built support wagons existed for blacksmithing, telegraphy and even observation ballooning.
In migration settings, such as the emigrant trails of the American West and the Great Trek of South Africa, wagons would travel together for support, navigation and protection.
A group of wagons may be used to create an improvised fort called a laager, made by circling them to form an enclosure.
In these settings, a chuckwagon is a small wagon used for providing food and cooking, essentially a portable kitchen.
In addition to horses and oxen, animals such as mules and goats have been used as draught animals for appropriately-sized wagons.
As a common, important element in history and life, wagons have been the subjects of artwork.
Some examples are the paintings The Hay Wain and The Haywain Triptych, and on the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar.
Vélib' Métropole is a large-scale public bicycle sharing system in Paris, France.
The system encompasses more than 16,000 bikes and 1,400 stations.
The name Vélib' is a portmanteau of the French words vélo ("bicycle") and liberté ("freedom").
Vélib' was operated originally as a concession by the French advertising corporation JCDecaux.
Launched on 15 July 2007, the system encompassed around 14,500 bicycles and 1,400 bicycle stations, located across Paris and in some surrounding municipalities, with an average daily ridership of 85,811 in 2011.
As of 2014, Vélib' was the world's 12th-largest bikesharing program by the number of bicycles in circulation; the rest of the top 18 are in Chinese cities.
As of July 2013, Velib' had the highest market penetration with 1 bike per 97 inhabitants, followed by Vélo'v in Lyon with 1 bike per 121 residents, and Hangzhou in China with 1 per 145.
From 2011 to 2018, Vélib' was complemented by Autolib', an electric car sharing scheme operating on similar principles.
As of 2018, Velib' has been rebranded as Vélib' Métropole, and is now operated by Smovengo.
It has since been expanded to 55 cities around Paris.
The initiative was proposed by Paris mayor and French Socialist Party member Bertrand Delanoë.
The system was launched on 15 July 2007 following Lyon's success of its contactless system Vélo'v in May 2005, the pioneering scheme in June 1998 of LE vélo STAR in Rennes, the first free public network (25 stations) with electronic identification of the bikes but which used magnetic cards or earlier the simple bicycle-sharing system of La Rochelle in 1974.
Velib' initially introduced to the city 7,000 bicycles, distributed among 750 automated rental stations, with fifteen or more bicycle parking slots each.
The following year the initiative was enlarged to some 16,000 bicycles and 1,200 rental stations, with roughly one station every 300 metres (980 ft) throughout the city centre.
making Vélib' the third-most-extensive system of its kind in the world in 2013, surpassed in station numbers only by systems in Hangzhou and Wuhan in China.
During its first year in operation, Vélib' reported 20 million trips made, and at its sixth anniversary, a total of 173 million journeys were reported.
As of 1 January 2018, Velib' has been rebranded as Vélib' Métropole.
It is now operated by Smovengo.
The service is operating in Paris and 64 surrounding cities.
After many technical issues at relaunch, the City of Paris set an ultimatum to resolve service problems by September 2018 which seemed to work as the system is slowly recovering in January 2019.
Velib' now also offers electric bicycles, in turquoise, distinct from its regular bicycles in green.
The system's bicycles are produced in Hungary by the French bicycle company Mercier and are repaired by JCDecaux.
The price per bicycle has been variously stated as US$500, $1,300 (if provided by JCDecaux), €300 , $3,460, or $3,500 apiece.
They are three-speed bicycles, each weighing approximately 22.5 kilograms (50 pounds).
Vélib' bikes are equipped with a locking system, a front basket and always-on LED lighting powered by a front-hub dynamo.
Each Vélib' station is equipped with an automatic rental terminal, a map of other nearby stations and stands for dozens of bicycles.
The rental terminals also display information about neighbouring Vélib' stations, including location, number of available bicycles and open stands.
If a user arrives with a rented bicycle at a station without open spots, the terminal grants another fifteen minutes of free rental time.
A fleet of 23 bicycle-transporting vehicles are used daily to redistribute bicycles between empty and full stations.
Current system prices are available on the Vélib website.
To use the system, users buy a subscription, which allows an unlimited number of rentals.
With a subscription, bike rental is free for the first half-hour of every individual trip; an unlimited number of such free trips can be made per day.
A trip that lasts longer than 30 minutes incurs an additional charge for each subsequent 30‑minute period.
The increasing price scale is intended to keep the bikes in circulation.
The subscription price is reduced for users aged under 26 or over 60.
Returning a bicycle to some stations located above an altitude of 60 metres gives free minutes of rental, that are credited to the user's account and can be used for future rentals exceeding 30 minutes.
A credit card or debit card with a PIN is required to sign up for the program and to rent the bikes.
The credit/debit card is charged a €300 deposit, to protect against bikes not being returned.
The credit card is required to contain an EMV chip to get a subscription at a station; short-term subscription can also be purchased online.
1‑day and 1‑week subscribers are given a subscription number to be used for future rentals during their subscription period, while 1‑year subscribers are sent an RFID card.
All types of sign-up can also be attached to a Navigo pass.
The RFID card and Navigo pass allow direct use of the card readers at Vélib stations.
The system was originally financed by the JCDecaux advertising corporation, in return for the city of Paris signing over the income from a substantial portion of on‑street advertising hoardings.
JCDecaux won the contract over a rival bid from Clear Channel.
JCDecaux paid the system start-up costs, totalling about $140 million, and employed around 285 people full-time to operate the system and repair bikes, under a ten-year contract.
The city received all revenue from the program, as well as a fee of about $4.3 million a year.
In return, JCDecaux received exclusive control over 1,628 city-owned billboards; the city receives about half of that advertising space at no charge for public-interest advertising (slightly different numbers were reported in July 2008).
This model was first used in France in 1998 by Adshel (now part of Clear Channel) in Rennes.
Due to an unexpectedly high rate of vandalism compared to the Lyon bicycle hire system, the Paris City Council agreed to pay replacement costs of $500 per vandalised bicycle, leading to unexpected costs of up to €2 million per year.
At least 3,000 bicycles were stolen in the first year of operation, a number far greater than had been initially anticipated.
By August 2009, of 20,600 bikes introduced into service, about 16,000 – some 80% of the total – had been replaced due to vandalism or theft; of the latter, fully 8,000 were stolen.
Stolen Vélib' bicycles turned up in shipping containers destined for North Africa, and in cities as far away as Brașov and Bucharest, Romania.
Vandalized cycles were sometimes thrown in the River Seine, or hung from lampposts.
In 2009, the New York Times reported that it was common to see Vélib' bicycles in their docking stations with flat tires, broken pedals, or other damage.
In 2012, however, the Financial Times reported that "attrition rates have fallen significantly" since the first two years of the program.
While maintenance continues to be an issue, the FT attributed this to "the difficulty of keeping up with the results of heavy use" of the "popular service", in addition to willful damage or theft.
JCDecaux officials told reporters that they underestimated the degree of potential losses from vandalism and theft, which had not significantly affected earlier JCDecaux-administered bike sharing programs in France, such as Vélo'v in Lyon.
In 2009 and in 2012, repair and maintenance efforts in Paris were reportedly running at some 1,500 Vélib bicycles per day, focusing mainly on tire re-inflation.
"The system is very costly in terms of implementation," the head of JCDecaux's board of directors said in 2012.
"But since 2011 it has achieved budgetary balance, after losing money during the first three years."
While JCDecaux does not disclose exact figures, according to Inter Press Service the system was expected to be profitable in 2012 as well.
Vandalism and theft of Vélib' cycles received a wave of press coverage in 2009, with some stories citing JCDecaux staff as their only source.
Some French officials and academics said that while real problems existed, such coverage exaggerated their scope, reflecting an effort by JCDecaux to strengthen its bargaining position in financial negotiations with Paris authorities.
"Decaux is using media sensationalism to obtain more money from the city of Paris," said Denis Baupin, the city's former Deputy Mayor for Transportation.
"It's in large part a PR issue," commented Luc Nadal of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy.
JCDecaux declined reporters' requests for comment.
The program's critics have cited the Vélib' program as a prime example of the economic principle of the tragedy of the commons.
Supporters say that despite its initial problems, Vélib has become a model of innovation in urban public services.
Issues have surfaced on how to safeguard riders from hiring a returned and damaged Vélib cycle or a cycle requiring immediate maintenance.
To indicate when there is a problem with the bike, it has become common for returning users to rotate the seat through 180 degrees to point backward.
While this practice assists staff in determining which bikes require immediate attention, it depends for its success on substantial voluntary user compliance.
Timing differences of up to 30 minutes exist between clocks of different rental stations due to poor synchronisation, and may give rise to overbilling or underbilling.
The mayor of Paris has given assurances that overcharges will be reimbursed.
Rental stations use the Microsoft Windows operating system and have been known to crash, giving the infamous blue screen of death.
There are frequent disparities between the availability of rental bicycles and the number of rental slots.
Each rental station indicates the number of bicycles available at the nearest stations.
Demand can be high during the working week and during transport strikes.
Although rental bicycles are not dedicated, it has been known for people to chain a bicycle to its station so that it will remain available to them for a subsequent trip.
Vélib' has declared this to be uncivic behaviour, and Vélib' employees are authorised to cut the locks in these cases.
Stations at greater elevations generally experience greater demand.
In addition, there is a net inflow of bicycles from the outskirts to the city centre earlier in the day, and a net flow outwards in the evening.
Thus, depending on the time of day, Vélib needs to manage the demand at its outermost and centremost stations.
Consequently, bicycles may be completely unavailable in some locations, whilst parking problems exist for others.
Vélib' faces logistical issues, and must relocate bikes during the course of each day.
There are proposals to make adjustments to the system's pricing mechanism.
The "bonus V'+" bonus system was put in place on 14 June 2008 in an effort to adjust the demand level.
Fifteen minutes of free cycling time is credited to users who rent bicycles from stations without the logo (mostly situated at the edge of the city and more than 60 m above sea level) and drop bicycles off at stations where the logo is displayed.
Due to continuing high demand, the Vélib' scheme was extended to neighbouring councils (up to 1.5 km beyond the boundaries of Paris) in 2008.
In microeconomics, management and international political economy, vertical integration is an arrangement in which the supply chain of a company is integrated and owned by that company.
Usually each member of the supply chain produces a different product or (market-specific) service, and the products combine to satisfy a common need.
It contrasts with horizontal integration, wherein a company produces several items that are related to one another.
Vertical integration has also described management styles that bring large portions of the supply chain not only under a common ownership but also into one corporation (as in the 1920s when the Ford River Rouge Complex began making much of its own steel rather than buying it from suppliers).
Vertical integration can be desirable because it secures supplies needed by the firm to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product, but it can become undesirable when a firm's actions become anti-competitive and impede free competition in an open marketplace.
Vertical integration is one method of avoiding the hold-up problem.
A monopoly produced through vertical integration is called a vertical monopoly: vertical in a supply chain measures a firm's distance from the final consumers; for example, a firm that sells directly to the consumers has a vertical position of 0, a firm that supplies to this firm has a vertical position of 1, and so on.
Vertical integration is often closely associated with vertical expansion which, in economics, is the growth of a business enterprise through the acquisition of companies that produce the intermediate goods needed by the business or help market and distribute its product.
Such expansion is desired because it secures the supplies needed by the firm to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product.
Such expansion can become undesirable when its actions become anti-competitive and impede free competition in an open marketplace.
The result is a more efficient business with lower costs and more profits.
On the undesirable side, when vertical expansion leads toward monopolistic control of a product or service then regulative action may be required to rectify anti-competitive behavior.
Related to vertical expansion is lateral expansion, which is the growth of a business enterprise through the acquisition of similar firms, in the hope of achieving economies of scale.
Vertical expansion is also known as a vertical acquisition.
Vertical expansion or acquisitions can also be used to increase sales and to gain market power.
The acquisition of DirecTV by News Corporation is an example of forwarding vertical expansion or acquisition.
DirecTV is a satellite TV company through which News Corporation can distribute more of its media content: news, movies, and television shows.
The acquisition of NBC by Comcast is an example of backward vertical integration.
For example, in the United States, protecting the public from communications monopolies that can be built in this way is one of the missions of the Federal Communications Commission.
Scholars' findings suggest that a reduction in inefficiencies caused by the market vertical value chains including downstream prices, double mark-up can be negated with vertical integration.
Application in more complex environments can help firms overcome market failures.
(markets with high transaction costs or assets specificities) Scholars also identified potential risks and boundaries which may occur under vertical integration.
This includes the potential competitor, the enhancements to horizontal collusion, development of barriers to entry.
However, it is still debated over if vertical integration expected efficiencies can lead to competitive harm to the market.
Some conclude that in many cases that the efficiencies outweigh the potential risks.
Contrary to horizontal integration, which is a consolidation of many firms that handle the same part of the production process, vertical integration is typified by one firm engaged in different parts of production (e.g., growing raw materials, manufacturing, transporting, marketing, and/or retailing).
Vertical integration is the degree to which a firm owns its upstream suppliers and its downstream buyers.
The differences depend on where the firm is placed in the order of the supply chain.
There are three varieties of vertical integration: backward (upstream) vertical integration, forward (downstream) vertical integration, and balanced (both upstream and downstream) vertical integration.
Backward vertical integration: A company exhibits backward vertical integration when it controls subsidiaries that produce some of the inputs used in the production of its products.
For example, an automobile company may own a tire company, a glass company, and a metal company.
Control of these three subsidiaries is intended to create a stable supply of inputs and ensure consistent quality in their final product.
It was the main business approach of Ford and other car companies in the 1920s, who sought to minimize costs by integrating the production of cars and car parts, as exemplified in the Ford River Rouge Complex.
This type of integration also makes the barriers to entry into an industry more difficult.
The control of subsidiaries that produce the raw materials needed in the production process gives a company the power to refuse access to resources to competitors and new entrants.
They have the ability to cut off the chain of supply for competing buyers and thus, strengthen their position in their respective industry.
Forward vertical integration: A company tends toward forward vertical integration when it controls distribution centers and retailers where its products are sold.
An example is a brewing company that owns and controls a number of bars or pubs.
Unlike backward vertical integration, which serves to reduce costs of production, forward vertical integration allows a company to decrease its costs of distribution.
This includes avoiding paying taxes for exchanges between stages in the chain of production, bypassing other price regulations, and removing the need for intermediary markets.
In addition, a company has the power to refuse to support sales of competing distribution centers and retailers.
Similar to backward vertical integration, this ability increases the barriers to entry into an industry.
Disintermediation is a form of vertical integration when purchasing departments take over the former role of wholesalers to source products.
For vertical integration to succeed, managers must be able to adapt their managerial approach to compliment the changes in functional activities that their vertical shift accompanies.
Managers should make sure that their firm can take advantage of existing functional knowledge through organisation, and simultaneously allow new functional knowledge to develop.
However, environmental possibilities can be a factor in determining whether vertical integration is successful.
Technology : the probability of vertical integration between the two industries is less likely when the supply industry is more technology-intensive and the production industry is less technology-intensive.
In addition, the impact of these factors is greater when inputs from the supply industry represent a large proportion of the total costs incurred by the production industry.
Switching cost and product differentiation : based on a new insight that pricing incentive choice of a downstream producer may change by vertical integration, downstream firms are more likely to switch to a different supplier if the investment by firms in a particular relationship is low, or if the input market is similar to the spot market.
In this case, vertical M&A is more likely to have a positive impact on consumers.
However, if supplier switching costs are high, the impact of a vertical integration on consumers depends on the degree of downstream product differentiation.
If the downstream product is significantly differentiated, vertical integration is more likely beneficial to consumers.
In contrast, if the downstream products are close substitutes, vertical integration is likely to harm consumers.
There are many problems and benefits that vertical integration brings to an economic system.
Problems that can stem from vertical integration can include large capital investments needed to set up and buy factories and maintain efficient profits.
Rapid technology development can increase integration difficulties and further increase costs.
The requirement of different business skills venturing into new portions of the supply chain can be challenging for the firm.
Another problem that may stem from vertical integration is the collapse of goals among the various firms in a supply chain.
With each firm operating under different systems, integration may cause initial problems in management and production.
Vertical integration also proves to be dangerous when monopolistic problems arise in a capitalistic economy.
When this happens, competition is removed and a corporation has the power to control all firms in its supply chain.
One benefit is that the implementation of vertical integration can yield increased profit margins or eliminate the leverage that other firms or buyers may have over the firm.
It allows improved coordination between production and distribution firms and decreases the cost of exchange of goods between firms within a supply chain.
Operational routines also become more consistent and certain as the management of these firms gradually merge.
Vertically integrated firms rarely need to worry about the sufficiency in their supply of materials because they generally control the facilities that provide them.
A vertically integrated company also creates high barriers of entry into their respective economy, eliminating most potential competition.
Implementing vertical integration can be beneficial in that it reduces the distance that separates the suppliers and customers from the resources or information, which can then boost profits and efficiency.
There are internal and external society-wide gains and losses stemming from vertical integration, which vary according to the state of technology in the industries involved, roughly corresponding to the stages of the industry lifecycle.[clarification needed][citation needed]
Static technology represents the simplest case, where the gains and losses have been studied extensively.[citation needed]
A vertically integrated company usually fails when transactions within the market are too risky or the contracts to support these risks are too costly to administer, such as frequent transactions and a small number of buyers and sellers.
Strategic independence (especially if important inputs are rare or highly volatile in price, such as rare-earth metals).
Lower the threshold for entry.
A sustained high surplus phase must be protected by barriers to entry.
As a result, a vertically integrated entrant is able to extend these barriers at a lower cost than the value of existing surpluses.
Accomplishing the maximum profits for selling products or services.
Loss of tax revenue as fewer intermediary transactions are made.
The following are several case studies of vertical integration in play.
Many examples center around American industries, where major companies like General Foods, Carnegie Steel Company, the Bell System, Apple, the U.S. entertainment studios, the U.S. meat industry, Ford Motor Company, CVS, and Amazon demonstrate vertical merging.
Other examples like Alibaba and EssilorLuxottica cover vertical integration in other nations.
During a hunting trip American explorer and scientist Clarence Birdseye discovered the beneficial effects of "quick-freezing".
For example, fish caught a few days previously that were kept in ice remained in perfect condition.
In 1924, Clarence Birdseye patented the "Birdseye Plate Froster" and established the General Seafood Corporation.
In 1929, Birdseye's company and the patent were bought by Postum Cereals and Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation.
It was later known as General Foods.
They kept the Birdseye name, which was split into two words (Birds eye) for use as a trademark.
Birdseye was paid $20 million for the patents and $2 million for the assets.
Birds Eye was one of the pioneers in the frozen food industry.
During these times, there was not a well-developed infrastructure to produce and sell frozen foods.
Hence Birds Eye developed its own system by using vertical integration.
Members of the supply chain, such as farmers and small food retailers, could not afford the high cost of equipment, so Birdseye provided it to them.
Until now, Birds Eye has faded slowly because they have fixed costs associated with vertical integration, such as property, plants, and equipment that cannot be reduced significantly when production needs decrease.
The Birds Eye company used vertical integration to create a larger organization structure with more levels of command.
This produced a slower information processing rate, with the side effect of making the company so slow that it could not react quickly.
Birds Eye did not take advantage of the growth of supermarkets until ten years after the competition did.
The already-developed infrastructure did not allow Birdseye to quickly react to market changes.
In order to increase profits and gain more market share, Alibaba, a China-based company, has implemented vertical integration deepening its company holdings to more than the e-commerce platform.
Alibaba has built its leadership in the market by gradually acquiring complementary companies in a variety of industries including delivery and payments.
One of the earliest, largest and most famous examples of vertical integration was the Carnegie Steel company.
The company controlled not only the mills where the steel was made, but also the mines where the iron ore was extracted, the coal mines that supplied the coal, the ships that transported the iron ore and the railroads that transported the coal to the factory, the coke ovens where the coal was coked, etc.
The company focused heavily on developing talent internally from the bottom up, rather than importing it from other companies.
Later, Carnegie established an institute of higher learning to teach the steel processes to the next generation.
Oil companies, both multinational (such as ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips or BP) and national (e.g., Petronas) often adopt a vertically integrated structure, meaning that they are active along the entire supply chain from locating deposits, drilling and extracting crude oil, transporting it around the world, refining it into petroleum products such as petrol/gasoline, to distributing the fuel to company-owned retail stations, for sale to consumers.
Standard Oil is a famous example of both horizontal and vertical integration, combining extraction, transport, refinement, wholesale distribution, and retail sales at company-owned gas stations.
Telephone companies in most of the 20th century, especially the largest (the Bell System) were integrated, making their own telephones, telephone cables, telephone exchange equipment and other supplies.
The Bell System is an example of an industry in which without vertical integration, would not be able to develop efficiently.
In order to implement a telecommunications system that connected cities across a nation reliably, vertical integration was called upon.
This strategic move ensured that the wiring, manufacture, and management of the system was consistent and functional across a state.
Another major success of Apple's, is the forward integration with their retail stores, allowing them to sell their products directly to customers (helping customers to buy and use Apple's products and services), additionally helping them to control the prices of their products, and thus to maintain high-profit margins when they do.
Apple is also known as one of the world's leading "orchestrators" as they exert control over the entire value chain, but do not do everything in-house (e.g. assembly of iPhones by manufacturing partner Foxconn).
From the early 1920s through the early 1950s, the American motion picture had evolved into an industry controlled by a few companies, a condition known as a "mature oligopoly", as it was led by eight major film studios, the most powerful of which were the "Big Five" studios: MGM, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, and RKO.
These studios were fully integrated, not only producing and distributing films, but also operating their own movie theaters; the "Little Three", Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists, produced and distributed feature films but did not own theaters.
The issue of vertical integration (also known as common ownership) has been the main focus of policy makers because of the possibility of anti-competitive behaviors affiliated with market influence.
For example, in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., the Supreme Court ordered the five vertically integrated studios to sell off their theater chains and all trade practices were prohibited (United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 1948).
The prevalence of vertical integration wholly predetermined the relationships between both studios and networks and modified criteria in financing.
Networks began arranging content initiated by commonly owned studios and stipulated a portion of the syndication revenues in order for a show to gain a spot on the schedule if it was produced by a studio without common ownership.
In response, the studios fundamentally changed the way they made movies and did business.
Lacking the financial resources and contract talent they once controlled, the studios now relied on independent producers supplying some portion of the budget in exchange for distribution rights.
Certain media conglomerates may, in a similar manner, own television broadcasters (either over-the-air or on cable), production companies that produce content for their networks, and also own the services that distribute their content to viewers (such as television and internet service providers).
AT&T, Bell Canada, Comcast, Sky plc, and Rogers Communications are vertically integrated in such a manner—operating media subsidiaries (such as WarnerMedia, Bell Media, NBCUniversal, and Rogers Media), and provide "triple play" services of television, internet, and phone service in some markets (such as Bell Satellite TV/Bell Internet, Rogers Cable, Xfinity, and Sky's satellite TV and internet services).
Additionally, Bell and Rogers own wireless providers, Bell Mobility and Rogers Wireless, while Comcast is partnered with Verizon Wireless for an Xfinity-branded MVNO.
Similarly, Sony has media holdings through its Sony Pictures division, including film and television content, as well as television channels, but is also a manufacturer of consumer electronics that can be used to play content from itself and others, including televisions, phones, and PlayStation video game consoles.
AT&T is the first ever vertical integration where a mobile phone company and a film studio company are under same umbrella.
Vertical integration through production and marketing contracts have also become the dominant model for livestock production.
Currently, 90% of poultry, 69% of hogs, and 29% of cattle are contractually produced through vertical integration.
The USDA supports vertical integration because it has increased food productivity.
However, "... contractors receive a large share of farm receipts, formerly assumed to go to the operator's family".
Under production contracts, growers raise animals owned by integrators.
Farm contracts contain detailed conditions for growers, who are paid based on how efficiently they use feed, provided by the integrator, to raise the animals.
The contract dictates how to construct the facilities, how to feed, house, and medicate the animals, and how to handle manure and dispose of carcasses.
Generally, the contract also shields the integrator from liability.
Jim Hightower, in his book, Eat Your Heart Out, discusses this liability role enacted by large food companies.
He finds that in many cases of agricultural vertical integration, the integrator (food company) denies the farmer the right of entrepreneurship.
This means that the farmer can only sell under and to the integrator.
These restrictions on specified growth, Hightower argues, strips the selling and producing power of the farmer.
The producer is ultimately limited by the established standards of the integrator.
Yet, at the same time, the integrator still keeps the responsibility connected to the farmer.
Hightower sees this as ownership without reliability.
Under marketing contracts, growers agree in advance to sell their animals to integrators under an agreed price system.
Generally, these contracts shield the integrator from liability for the grower's actions and the only negotiable item is a price.
In the United States new automobiles can not be sold at dealerships owned by the same company that produced them but are protected by state franchise laws.
Ford Motor Company vertically integrated due to high demand for their Model T automobile.
With the development of Model T, the company required a system in which mass production was most efficient.
The model called for the manufacture of additional devices, all of which had carefully-curated designs by Ford engineers.
Instead of passing these instructions and duties off to external manufacture firms, vertical integration was exercised within the corporation.
This allowed for manageable division of labor, decreased costs in delay and exchange of goods, and organized updates of each firm in the supply chain.
Vertical integration enabled Ford Motor Company to be self-regulating and self-sufficient.
EssilorLuxottica, the company that merged with Essilor and Luxottica, occupies up to 30% of the global market share as well as representing billions of pairs of lenses and frames sold annually.
Before the merger, Luxottica also owned 80% of the market share of companies that produce corrective and protective eyewear as well as owning many retailers, optical departments at Target and Sears, and key eye insurance groups, such as EyeMed, many of which are already part of the now merged company.
Within healthcare systems, horizontal integration is generally much more prominent.
However, in the United States, major vertical mergers have included CVS Health's purchase of Aetna, and Cigna's purchase of Express Scripts.
The integration of CVS Health and Aetna resulted in the combination of one of the nation's largest health insurance companies with a pharmaceutical company seen all across the U.S.
The vertical merge allowed CVS-Aetna to regulate more of the healthcare and delivery chain and gave them the ability to provide higher quality care to consumers.
One of the most significant advantages to this integration is the reduction in costs for healthcare.
Amazon.com has been criticized for being anti-competitive as both an owner and participant of its dominant online marketplace.
In office products, Sycamore Partners owns both Staples, Inc., a major retailer, and Essendant, a dominant wholesaler.
Before a wave of deregulation at the end of 20th century, most electric utilities were vertically integrated and provided electric generation, transmission, distribution, and sales.
These were not just conglomerates with a common accounting department: there was just one profit center in sales, and costs of transmission and distribution were not separated.
Partial deregulation in the US in 1978 (PURPA) forced the utilities to buy electricity outside if the rates were competitive; this gave rise to independent power producers.
The other deviation from the vertical integration model were local distribution companies in some towns and regions.
In the US 250 vertically integrated companies provided 85% of electrical generation.
As of 2022, this "public utility" model was still utilized in some US states, mostly in the Mountain West, Great Plains, and Southeast.
An economic theory is a framework that defines how a particular economic system functions.
Economists develop principles in which an economy adheres to, which provides insight onto the relationships between economic events, markets, companies, and the government.
In economic theory, vertical integration has been studied in the literature on incomplete contracts that was developed by Oliver Hart and his coauthors.
Consider a seller of an intermediate product that is used by a buyer to produce a final product.
The intermediate product can only be produced with the help of specific physical assets (e.g., machines, buildings).
Should the buyer own the assets (vertical integration) or should the seller own the assets (non-integration)?
Suppose that today the parties have to make relationship-specific investments.
Since today complete contracts cannot be written, the two parties will negotiate tomorrow about how to divide the returns of the investments.
Since the owner is in a better bargaining position, he will have stronger incentives to invest.
Hence, whether vertical integration is desirable or not depends on whose investments are more important.
Hart's theory has been extended by several authors.
For instance, DeMeza and Lockwood (1998) have studied different bargaining games, while Schmitz (2006) has introduced asymmetric information into the incomplete contracting setup.
In these extended models, vertical integration can sometimes be optimal even if only the seller has to make an investment decision.
Vehicle insurance (also known as car insurance, motor insurance, or auto insurance) is insurance for cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other road vehicles.
Its primary use is to provide financial protection against physical damage or bodily injury resulting from traffic collisions and against liability that could also arise from incidents in a vehicle.
Vehicle insurance may additionally offer financial protection against theft of the vehicle, and against damage to the vehicle sustained from events other than traffic collisions, such as keying, weather or natural disasters, and damage sustained by colliding with stationary objects.
The specific terms of vehicle insurance vary with legal regulations in each region.
Widespread use of the motor car began after the First World War in urban areas.
Cars were relatively fast and dangerous by that stage, yet there was still no compulsory form of car insurance anywhere in the world.
This meant that injured victims would rarely get any compensation in a crash, and drivers often faced considerable costs for damage to their car and property.
A compulsory car insurance scheme was introduced in the United Kingdom with the Road Traffic Act 1930.
This ensured that all vehicle owners and drivers had to be insured for their liability for injury or death to third parties while their vehicle was being used on a public road.
Germany enacted similar legislation in 1939 called the "Act on the Implementation of Compulsory Insurance for Motor Vehicle Owners".
In many jurisdictions, it is compulsory to have vehicle insurance before using or keeping a motor vehicle on public roads.
Most jurisdictions relate insurance to both the car and the driver; however, the degree of each varies greatly.
Several jurisdictions have experimented with a "pay-as-you-drive" insurance plan which utilizes either a tracking device in the vehicle or vehicle diagnostics.
This could address issues of uninsured motorists by providing additional options and also charge based on the distance driven, which could theoretically increase the efficiency of the insurance, through streamlined collection.
Comprehensive insurance covers damages to third-party vehicles, other third-party property and the insured vehicle.
Third-Party Property Damage insurance covers damage to third-party property and vehicles, but not the insured vehicle.
Third-Party Property Damage with Fire and Theft insurance covers the insured vehicle against fire and theft as well as damage to third-party property and vehicles.
CTP insurance is compulsory in every state in Australia and is paid as part of vehicle registration.
It covers the vehicle owner and any person who drives the vehicle against claims for liability for death or injury to people caused by the fault of the vehicle owner or driver.
CTP may include any kind of physical harm, bodily injuries and may cover the cost of all reasonable medical treatment for injuries received in the crash, loss of wages, cost of care services and, in some cases, compensation for pain and suffering.
Each state in Australia has a different scheme.
Third-Party Property insurance or Comprehensive insurance covers the third party with the repairing cost of the vehicle, any property damage or medication expenses as a result of a crash by the insured.
They are not to be confused with Compulsory Third-Party insurance, which is for injuries or death of someone in a motor crash.
In New South Wales, each vehicle must be insured before it can be registered.
It is often called a 'greenslip', because of its colour.
There are five licensed CTP insurers in New South Wales.
Suncorp holds licences for GIO and AAMI and Allianz holds one licence.
The remaining two licences are held by QBE and NRMA Insurance (NRMA).
APIA and Shannons and InsureMyRide insurance also supply CTP insurance licensed by GIO.
A privately provided scheme also applies in the Australian Capital Territory through AAMI, APIA, GIO and NRMA.
Vehicle owners pay for CTP as part of their vehicle registration.
In Queensland, CTP is included in the registration fee for a vehicle.
There is a choice of private insurer – Allianz, QBE and Suncorp and price is government controlled.
In South Australia, since July 2016, CTP is no longer provided by the Motor Accident Commission.
The government has now licensed four private insurers – AAMI, Allianz, QBE and SGIC – to offer CTP insurance SA.
Since July 2019, vehicle owners can choose their own CTP insurer and new insurers may also enter the market.
There are three states and one territory that do not have a private CTP scheme.
In Victoria, the Transport Accident Commission provides CTP through a levy in the vehicle registration fee, known as the TAC charge.
A similar scheme exists in Tasmania through the Motor Accidents Insurance Board.
A similar scheme applies in Western Australia, through the Insurance Commission of Western Australia (ICWA).
The Northern Territory scheme is managed through Territory Insurance Office (TIO).
For all types of motor insurance policies in Bangladesh, the limit of liability has been fixed by the law.
Currently, the limits are too low to compensate the victims.
In respect of Act Only Liability Motor Vehicle Insurance, the compensation for personal injuries and property damage to third parties is BDT 20,000 for death, BDT 10,000 for severe injury, BDT 5,000 for injury, and BDT 50,000 for property damage.
The limits are under review by the governmental bodies.
Several Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec) provide a public auto insurance system while in the rest of the country insurance is provided privately.
The third-party insurance is privatized in Quebec and is mandatory.
The province covers everything but the vehicle(s).
Basic auto insurance is mandatory throughout Canada (with some exceptions, such as government vehicles) with each province's government determining which benefits are included as minimum required auto insurance coverage and which benefits are options available for those seeking additional coverage.
Accident benefits coverage is mandatory everywhere except for Newfoundland and Labrador.
All provinces in Canada have some form of no-fault insurance available to crash victims.
The difference from province to province is the extent to which tort or no-fault is emphasized.
International drivers entering Canada are permitted to drive any vehicle their licence allows for the three-month period for which they are allowed to use their international licence.
International laws provide visitors to the country with an International Insurance Bond (IIB) until this three-month period is over in which the international driver must provide themselves with Canadian Insurance.
The IIB is reinstated every time the international driver enters the country.
Damage to the driver's own vehicle is optional – one notable exception to this is in Saskatchewan, where SGI provides collision coverage (less than a $1000 deductible, such as a collision damage waiver) as part of its basic insurance policy.
In Saskatchewan, residents have the option to have their auto insurance through a tort system but less than 0.5% of the population have taken this option.
Facility insurance policies are offered by the "facility association residual market" (or "FARM"), as a last resort since auto insurance is mandatory in Canada, for private and commercial high-risk drivers who cannot buy a policy in the voluntary market (regular auto insurance).
Traffic Compulsory Insurance provides protection in the event of third party injuries, third party property losses, etc.
The minimum liability cover is RMB180,000 for death and injury/per crash, RMB18,000 for medical expense, and RMB2,000 for physical loss.
Additional 3rd Party Liability Insurance  also known as Commercial Motor Insurance provides extra cover up to RMB10,000,000 excluding the driver and passengers.
Driver and Passenger insurance covers the driver and passengers, whilst Vehicle Damage and Theft Insurance covers vehicle damage and the objects contained inside.
Excess Waiver Insurance is an additional option that waives any deductibles.
According to section 4(1) of the Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third-Party Risks) Ordinance (Cap. 272 of the Laws of Hong Kong), all users of a car, include its permitted users, must have insurance or some other security with respect to third-party risks.
Third party insurance protects the policyholder against liability of death or bodily injury to third party up to HK$100,000,000 and/or damage to third party property up to HK$2,000,000 as a result of crash arising out of the use of the insured vehicle.
Comprehensive Motor Insurance is also available.
The mandatory minimum legal requirement Third Party Liability ("TPL")
Cover is MOP1,500,000 per crash and MOP30,000,000 per year, protecting against the legal liability arising from a traffic crash causing loss and damages to any third party..
Comprehensive Motor Insurance is also available.
in the case of damage to property, €1,000,000 per claim, whatever the number of victims.
In some European languages, comprehensive non-mandatory insurance is known as casco (Casualty and Collision).
Since 1939, it has been compulsory to have third-party personal insurance before keeping a motor vehicle in all federal states of Germany.
In addition, every vehicle owner is free to take out a comprehensive insurance policy.
All types of car insurance are provided by several private insurers.
The amount of insurance contribution is determined by several criteria, like the region, the type of car or the personal way of driving.
The minimum coverage defined by German law for car liability insurance / third-party personal insurance is €7,500,000 for bodily injury (damage to people), €500,000 for property damage and €50,000 for financial/fortune loss which is in no direct or indirect coherence with bodily injury or property damage.
Insurance companies usually offer all-in/combined single limit insurance policies of €50,000,000 or €100,000,000 (about €141,000,000) for bodily injury, property damage and other financial/fortune loss (usually with a bodily injury coverage limitation of €8–15,000,000 for each bodily injured person).
Third party vehicle insurance is mandatory for all vehicles in Hungary.
No exemption is possible by money deposit.
The premium covers all damage up to HUF 500m (about €1.8m) per crash without deductible.
The coverage is extended to HUF 1,250m (about €4.5m) in case of personal injuries.
Vehicle insurance policies from all EU countries and some non-EU countries are valid in Hungary based on bilateral or multilateral agreements.
Visitors with vehicle insurance not covered by such agreements are required to buy a monthly, renewable policy at the border.
Third-party vehicle insurance is a mandatory requirement in Indonesia and each individual car and motorcycle must be insured or the vehicle will not be considered legal; this compulsory auto insurance is legally called the Road Traffic Accidents Compulsory Coverage Fund (Indonesian: Dana Pertanggungan Wajib Kecelakaan Lalu Lintas Jalan, DPWKLLJ).
Therefore, a motorist cannot drive the vehicle until it is insured.
DPWKLLJ was introduced in 1964 and merely covers body injuries, and is operated by a SOE called PT Jasa Raharja (Persero).
DPWKLLJ is included, through an annual premium called the Compulsory Donation to the Road Traffic Accident Fund (Indonesian: Sumbangan Wajib Dana Kecelakaan Lalu Lintas Jalan, SWDKLLJ), in the annual vehicle tax which is paid to the local Samsat (Sistem Administrasi Manunggal di bawah Satu Atap), which is responsible for cars and roads.
Auto insurance in India covers the loss of or damage caused to the automobile or its parts due to natural and man-made calamities.
It provides accident cover for individual owners of the vehicle while driving and also for passengers and third party legal liability.
There are certain general insurance companies who also offer online insurance service for the vehicle.
Auto insurance is a compulsory requirement for all new vehicles used whether for commercial or personal use.
Insurance companies have tie-ups with leading automobile manufacturers.
They offer their customers instant auto quotes.
Premiums are determined by a number of factors and the amount of premium increases with the rise in the price of the vehicle.
The claims of the auto insurance in India can be accidental, theft claims or third party claims.
Certain documents are required for claiming auto insurance, like duly signed claim form, Registration Certificate copy of the vehicle, driving license copy, First information report copy, original estimate and policy copy.
Private car insurance – the fastest growing sector in India as it is compulsory for all new cars.
The amount of premium depends on the make and value of the car, state where the car is registered and the year of manufacture.
This amount can be reduced by asking the insurer for a no claim bonus (NCB) if no claim is made for insurance in previous year.
Two wheeler insurance – covers accidental insurance for the driver of the vehicle.
The amount of premium depends on the current showroom price multiplied by the depreciation rate fixed by the Tariff Advisory Committee at the beginning of a policy period.
Commercial vehicle insurance – provides cover for all the vehicles which are not used for personal purposes like trucks and HMVs.
The amount of premium depends on the showroom price of the vehicle at the commencement of the insurance period, make of the vehicle and the place of registration of the vehicle.
Third party insurance cover is mandatory under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
This cover cannot be used for personal damages.
This is offered at low premiums and allows for third party claims under "no-fault liability".
The premium is calculated through the rates provided by the Tariff Advisory Committee.
This is a branch of the IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India).
It covers bodily injury/accidental death and property damage.
The Road Traffic Act, 1933 requires all drivers of mechanically propelled vehicles in public places to have at least third-party insurance, or to have obtained exemption – generally by depositing a (large) sum of money to the High Court as a guarantee against claims.
In 1933, this figure was set at £15,000.
The Road Traffic Act, 1961 (which is currently in force) repealed the 1933 act but replaced these sections with functionally identical sections.
From 1968, those making deposits require the consent of the Minister for Transport to do so, with the sum specified by the Minister.
Those not exempted from obtaining insurance must obtain a certificate of insurance from their insurance provider, and display a portion of this (an insurance disc) on their vehicles' windscreen (if fitted).
The certificate in full must be presented to a police station within ten days if requested by an officer.
Proof of having insurance or an exemption must also be provided to pay for the motor tax.
Those injured or suffering property damage/loss due to uninsured drivers can claim against the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland's uninsured drivers fund, as can those injured (but not those suffering damage or loss) from hit and run offences.
The law 990/1969 requires that each motor vehicle or trailer standing or moving on a public road have third-party insurance (called RCA, Responsabilità civile per gli autoveicoli).
Historically, a part of the certificate of insurance must be displayed on the windscreen of the vehicle.
This latter requirement was revoked in 2015, when a national database of insured vehicles was built by the Insurance Company Association (ANIA, Associazione Nazionale Imprese Assicuratrici) and the National Transportation Authority (Motorizzazione Civile) to verify (by private citizens and public authorities) if a vehicle is insured.
There is no exemption policy to this law disposition.
Driving without the necessary insurance for that vehicle is an offence that can be prosecuted by the police and fines range from 841 to 3,287 euros.
Police forces also have the power to seize a vehicle that does not have the necessary insurance in place, until the owner of the vehicle pays a fine and signs a new insurance policy.
The same provision is applied when the vehicle is standing on a public road.
Minimal insurance policies cover only third parties (including the insured person and third parties carried with the vehicle, but not the driver, if the two do not coincide).
Third parties, fire and theft is a common insurance policy, while the all-inclusive policies (kasko policy) which include also damages of the vehicle causing the crash or the injuries.
It is also common to include a renounce clause of the insurance company to compensate the damages against the insured person in some cases (usually in case of DUI or other infringement of the law by the driver).
The victims of crashes caused by non-insured vehicles could be compensated by the Road's Victim Warranty Fund (Fondo garanzia vittime della strada), which is covered by a fixed amount (2.5%, as 2015) of each RCA insurance premium.
Third-party vehicle insurance is a mandatory requirement for every vehicle in the Netherlands.
This obligation is mandatory based on article 2 of the Wet aansprakelijkheidsverzekering motorrijtuigen.
When a vehicle is not insured the owner will receive a fine from the RDW (Netherlands Vehicle Authority).
The third-party vehicle insurance is called a WA verzekering where WA stands for Wettelijke aansprakelijkheid which means legal liability.
In general there are three types of auto insurance in the Netherlands: WA verzekering (liability insurance), WA beperkt casco (limited frame coverage), and WA vollledig casco (full frame coverage).
Limited frame and full frame coverage will provide more coverage against certain additional risks which are not covered by the mandatory legal third-party coverage.
For example limited frame coverage will provide coverage against damage caused by the weather such as storm and flooding.
Also fire damage and theft of the car is covered.
Full frame coverage will provide coverage against all risks mentioned plus damage to the car caused by the driver himself.
Within New Zealand, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) provides nationwide no-fault personal injury insurance.
Injuries involving motor vehicles operating on public roads are covered by the Motor Vehicle Account, for which premiums are collected through levies on petrol and through vehicle licensing fees.
In Norway, the vehicle owner must provide the minimum liability insurance for his/her vehicle(s) – of any kind.
Otherwise, the vehicle is illegal to use.
If a person drives a vehicle belonging to someone else and has a crash, the insurance will cover for damage done.
Note that the policy carrier can choose to limit the coverage to only apply for family members or persons over a certain age.
Romanian law mandates Răspundere Auto Civilă, a motor-vehicle liability insurance for all vehicle owners to cover damages to third parties.
Motor vehicle liability insurance is mandatory for all owners in Russian legislation.
Insurance of the vehicle itself is technically voluntary, but may be mandated in some circumstances, e.g. if the car is leased.
South Africa allocates a percentage of the money from fuel into the Road Accident Fund, which goes towards compensating third parties in crashes.
Each motor vehicle on a public road is required to have third party insurance (called Seguro de responsabilidad civil).
Police forces have the power to seize vehicles that do not have the necessary insurance in place, until the owner of the vehicle pays the fine and signs a new insurance policy.
Driving without the necessary insurance for that vehicle is an offence that will be prosecuted by the police and will receive a penalty.
The same provision is applied when the vehicle is standing on a public road.
The minimum insurance policy covers only third parties (including the insured person and third parties carried with the vehicle, but not the driver, if the two do not coincide).
Third parties, fire and theft is a common insurance policy.
Victims of accidents caused by non-insured vehicles may be compensated by a Warranty Fund, which is covered by a fixed amount for each insurance premium.
Since 2013 it is possible to contract an insurance by days as is possible in countries such as Germany and the UK.
When buying car insurance in the United Arab Emirates, the traffic department requires a 13-month insurance certificate each time a person registers or renews a vehicle registration.
In Dubai, vehicle insurance is compulsory as per the UAE RTA law.
There are two types of motor insurance policies in Dubai, Third-Party Liability Insurance and Comprehensive Motor Insurance.
It is mandatory to have third-party liability insurance for every individual vehicle owner in Dubai.
This insurance policy is the most basic form of vehicle insurance Dubai as it covers the third-party property damage or bodily injuries caused by the insured vehicle.
Policyholder's own vehicle damage such as fire, theft, and accidental collision is not covered under the third-party liability insurance policy.
In 1930, the UK Government introduced a law that required every person who used a vehicle on the road to have at least third-party personal injury insurance.
Today, this law is contained in the Road Traffic Act 1988 (generally referred to as the RTA 1988 as amended).
Section 143 of that Act requires that motorists be insured against liability for injuries to others (including passengers) and for damage to other persons' property, resulting from use of a vehicle on a public road or in other public places.
Formerly, an alternative to compulsory insurance existed, whereby an individual could make a specified deposit (£500,000 in 1991) and keep the sum deposited with the Accountant General of the Supreme Court.
However, this option was abolished in 2019.
It is an offence to use a motor vehicle, or allow others to use it without insurance that satisfies the requirements of the Act.
This requirement applies while any part of a vehicle (even if a greater part of it is on private land) is on the public highway.
No such legislation applies on private land.
However, private land to which the public have a reasonable right of access (for example, a supermarket car park during opening hours) is considered to be included within the requirements of the Act.
Police have the power to seize vehicles that do not appear to have necessary insurance in place.
A driver caught driving without insurance for the vehicle he/she is in charge of for the purposes of driving, is liable to be prosecuted by the police and, upon conviction, will receive either a fixed penalty or magistrate's courts penalty.
The registration number of the vehicle shown on the insurance policy, along with other relevant information including the effective dates of cover are transmitted electronically to the UK's Motor Insurance Database (MID) which exists to help reduce incidents of uninsured driving in the territory.
The Police are able to spot-check vehicles that pass within range of automated number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, that can search the MID instantly.
Proof of insurance lies entirely with the issue of a Certificate of Motor Insurance, or cover note, by an Authorised Insurer which, to be valid, must have been previously 'delivered' to the insured person in accordance with the Act, and be printed in black ink on white paper.
The insurance certificate or cover note issued by the insurance company constitutes the only legal evidence that the policy to which the certificate relates satisfies the requirements of the relevant law applicable in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Island of Guernsey, the Island of Jersey and the Island of Alderney.
The Act states that an authorised person, such as a police officer, may require a driver to produce an insurance certificate for inspection.
If the driver cannot show the document immediately on request, and evidence of insurance cannot be found by other means such as the MID, then the Police are empowered to seize the vehicle instantly.
The immediate impounding of an apparently uninsured vehicle replaces the former method of dealing with insurance spot-checks where drivers were issued with an HORT/1 (so-called because the order was form number 1 issued by the Home Office Road Traffic dept).
This 'ticket' was an order requiring that within seven days, from midnight of the date of issue, the driver concerned was to take a valid insurance certificate (and usually other driving documents as well) to a police station of the driver's choice.
Failure to produce an insurance certificate was, and still is, an offence.
The HORT/1 was commonly known – even by the issuing authorities when dealing with the public – as a "Producer".
As these are seldom issued now and the MID relied upon to indicate the presence of insurance or not, it is incumbent upon the insurance industry to accurately and swiftly update the MID with current policy details and insurers that fail to do so can be penalised by their regulating body.
Vehicles kept in the UK must now be continuously insured unless a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) has been formally submitted.
This requirement arose following a change in the law in June 2011 when a regulation known as Continuous Insurance Enforcement (CIE) came into force.
The effect of this was that in the UK a vehicle that is not declared SORN, must have a valid insurance policy in force whether or not it is kept on public roads and whether or not it is driven.
Insurer, and Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) / licence data, are shared by the relevant authorities including the police and this forms an integral part of the mechanism of CIE.
All UK registered vehicles, including those that are exempt from VED (for example, Historic Vehicles and cars with low or zero emissions) are subject to the VED taxation application process.
Part of this is a check on the vehicle's insurance.
A physical receipt for the payment of VED was issued by way of a paper disc which, prior to 1 October 2014, meant that all motorists in the UK were required to prominently display the tax disc on their vehicle when it was kept or driven on public roads.
This helped to ensure that most people had adequate insurance on their vehicles because insurance cover was required to purchase a disc, although the insurance must merely have been valid at the time of purchase and not necessarily for the life of the tax disc.
To address the problems that arise where a vehicle's insurance was subsequently cancelled but the tax disc remained in force and displayed on the vehicle and the vehicle then used without insurance, the CIE regulations are now able to be applied as the Driver & Vehicle Licence Authority (DVLA) and the MID databases are shared in real-time meaning that a taxed but uninsured vehicle is easily detectable by both authorities and Traffic Police.
From 1 October 2014, it is no longer a legal requirement to display a vehicle excise licence (tax disc) on a vehicle.
This has come about because the whole VED process can now be administered electronically and alongside the MID, doing away with the expense, to the UK Government, of issuing paper discs.
If a vehicle is to be "laid up" for whatever reason, a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) must be submitted to the DVLA to declare that the vehicle is off the public roads and will not return to them unless the SORN is cancelled by the vehicle's owner.
Once a vehicle has been declared 'SORN' then the legal requirement to insure it ceases, although many vehicle owners may desire to maintain cover for loss of or damage to the vehicle while it is off the road.
A vehicle that is then to be put back on the road must be subject to a new application for VED and be insured.
Part of the VED application requires an electronic check of the MID, in this way the lawful presence of a vehicle on the road for both VED and insurance purposes is reinforced.
It follows that the only circumstances in which a vehicle can have no insurance is if it has a valid SORN; was exempted from SORN (as untaxed on or before 31 October 1998 and has had no tax or SORN activity since); is recorded as 'stolen and not recovered' by the Police; is between registered keepers; or is scrapped.
Road Traffic Act Only Insurance differs from Third-Party-Only Insurance (detailed below) and is not often sold, unless to underpin, for example, a corporate body wishing to self-insure above the requirements of the Act.
It provides the very minimum cover to satisfy the requirements of the Act.
Road Traffic Act Only Insurance has a limit of £1,000,000 for damage to third-party property, while third-party-only insurance typically has a greater limit for third-party property damage.
Motor insurers in the UK place a limit on the amount that they are liable for in the event of a claim by third parties against a legitimate policy.
This can be explained in part by the Great Heck Rail Crash that cost the insurers over £22,000,000 in compensation for the fatalities and damage to property caused by the actions of the insured driver of a motor vehicle that caused the disaster.
No limit applies to claims from third parties for death or personal injury, but UK car insurance is now commonly limited to £20,000,000 for any claim or series of claims for loss of or damage to third-party property caused by or arising out of one incident.
The minimum level of insurance cover generally available, and which satisfies the requirement of the Act, is called third-party-only insurance.
The level of cover provided by Third-party-only insurance is basic, but does exceed the requirements of the act.
This insurance covers any liability to third parties, but does not cover any other risks.
More commonly purchased is third party, fire and theft.
This covers all third-party liabilities and also covers the vehicle owner against the destruction of the vehicle by fire (whether malicious or due to a vehicle fault) and theft of the insured vehicle.
It may or may not cover vandalism.
This kind of insurance and the two preceding types do not cover damage to the vehicle caused by the driver or other hazards.
Some classes of vehicle ownership, or use, are "Crown Exempt" from the requirement to be covered under the Act including vehicles owned or operated by certain councils and local authorities, national park authorities, education authorities, police authorities, fire authorities, health service bodies, the security services and vehicles used to or from Shipping Salvage purposes.
Although exempt from the requirement to insure, this provides no immunity against claims being made against them, so an otherwise Crown Exempt authority may choose to insure conventionally, preferring to incur the known expense of insurance premiums rather than accept the open-ended exposure of effectively, self-insuring under Crown Exemption.
The Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) compensates the victims of road crashes caused by uninsured and untraced motorists.
It also operates the MID, which contain details of every insured vehicle in the country and acts as a means to share information between insurance companies.
Soon after the introduction of the Road Traffic Act in 1930, unexpected issues arose when motorists needed to drive a vehicle other than their own in genuine emergency circumstances.
Volunteering to move a vehicle, for example, where another motorist had been taken ill or been involved in a crash, could lead to the "assisting" driver being prosecuted for no insurance if the other car's insurance did not cover use by any driver.
To alleviate this loophole, an extension to UK Car Insurances was introduced allowing a Policyholder to personally drive any other motor car not belonging to him/her and not hired to him/her under a hire purchase or leasing agreement.
This extension of cover, known as "Driving Other Cars" (where it is granted) usually applies to the Policyholder only.
The cover provided is for Third-Party Risks only and there is absolutely no cover for loss of, or damage to the vehicle being driven.
This aspect of UK motor insurance is the only one that purports to cover the driving of a vehicle, not use.
On 1 March 2011, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that gender could no longer be used by insurers to set car insurance premiums.
The new ruling came into action from December 2012.
In September 2012, it was announced that the Competition Commission had launched an investigation into the UK system for credit repairs and credit hire of an alternative vehicle leading to claims from third parties following an crash.
Where their client is considered to be not at fault, Accident Management Companies will take over the running of their client's claim and arrange everything for them, usually on a 'No Win – No Fee' basis.
It was shown that the insurers of the at-fault vehicle, were unable to intervene in order to have control over the costs that were applied to the claim by means of repairs, storage, vehicle hire, referral fees and personal injury.
The subsequent cost of some items submitted for consideration has been a cause for concern over recent years as this has caused an increase in the premium costs, contrary to the general duty of all involved to mitigate the cost of claims.
Also, the recent craze of "Cash for crash" has substantially raised the cost of policies.
This is where two parties arrange a collision between their vehicles and one driver making excessive claims for damage and non-existent injuries to themselves and the passengers that they had arranged to be "in the vehicle" at the time of the collision.
Another recent development has seen crashes being caused deliberately by a driver "slamming" on their brakes so that the driver behind hits them, this is usually carried out at roundabouts, when the following driver is looking to the right for oncoming traffic and does not notice that the vehicle in front has suddenly stopped for no reason.
The 'staging' of a motor collision on the Public Highway for the purpose of attempting an insurance fraud is considered by the Courts to be organised crime and upon conviction is dealt with as such.
The regulations for vehicle insurance differ with each of the 50 US states and other territories, with each U.S. state having its own mandatory minimum coverage requirements (see separate main article).
48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia require drivers to have insurance coverage for both bodily injury and property damage, with New Hampshire and Virginia being the exception, but the minimum amount of coverage required by law varies by state.
For example, minimum bodily injury liability coverage requirements range from $30,000 in Arizona to $100,000 in Alaska and Maine, while minimum property damage liability requirements range from $5,000 to $25,000 in most states.
This is the minimum cover corresponding to the terms of the Road Transport Act 1987.
The insurance concerns the legal liability for death or physical injury to the third party (not include the passengers), so it is hardly ever written by insurers.
This type is compulsory to buy for every vehicle so it is the most basic and common car insurance, which insures you against claims for the injury or damage to the third party or its property in a crash.
In addition to third-party coverage, this policy also provides insurance for your own vehicle due to fire, crash or theft.
This policy provides the widest coverage, i.e. the third party's physical injury and death, third party's vehicle damage and your own vehicle's damage caused by fire, theft or a crash.
This type of insurance is usually designed for luxury vehicles.
The cost to rent a vehicle if yours is damaged.
The cost to tow your vehicle to a repair facility.
Crashes involving uninsured motorists.
Different policies specify the circumstances under which each item is covered.
For example, a vehicle can be insured against theft, fire damage, or crash damage independently.
If a vehicle is declared a total loss and the vehicle's market value is less than the amount that is still owed to the bank that is financing the vehicle, GAP insurance may cover the difference.
Not all auto insurance policies include GAP insurance.
GAP insurance is often offered by the finance company at time the vehicle is purchased.
An excess payment, also known as a deductible, is a fixed contribution that must be paid each time a car is repaired with the charges billed to an automotive insurance policy.
Normally this payment is made directly to the crash repair "garage" (the term "garage" refers to an establishment where vehicles are serviced and repaired) when the owner collects the car.
If one's car is declared to be a "write-off" (or "totaled"), then the insurance company will deduct the excess agreed on the policy from the settlement payment it makes to the owner.
If the crash was the other driver's fault, and this fault is accepted by the third party's insurer, then the vehicle owner may be able to reclaim the excess payment from the other person's insurance company.
The excess itself can also be protected by a motor excess insurance policy.
A compulsory excess is the minimum excess payment the insurer will accept on the insurance policy.
Minimum excesses vary according to the personal details, driving record and the insurance company.
For example, young or inexperienced drivers and types of incident can incur additional compulsory excess charges.
To reduce the insurance premium, the insured party may offer to pay a higher excess (deductible) than the compulsory excess demanded by the insurance company.
The voluntary excess is the extra amount, over and above the compulsory excess, that is agreed to be paid in the event of a claim on the policy.
As a bigger excess reduces the financial risk carried by the insurer, the insurer is able to offer a significantly lower premium.
Depending on the jurisdiction, the insurance premium can be either mandated by the government or determined by the insurance company, in accordance with a framework of regulations set by the government.
Often, the insurer will have more freedom to set the price on physical damage coverages than on mandatory liability coverages.
When the premium is not mandated by the government, it is usually derived from the calculations of an actuary, based on statistical data.
The premium can vary depending on many factors that are believed to affect the expected cost of future claims.
Those factors can include the car characteristics, the coverage selected (deductible, limit, covered perils), the profile of the driver (age, gender, driving history) and the usage of the car (commute to work or not, predicted annual distance driven).
The address of the owner can affect the premiums.
Areas with high crime rates generally lead to higher costs of insurance.
Because male drivers, especially younger ones, are on average often regarded as tending to drive more aggressively, the premiums charged for policies on vehicles whose primary driver is male are often higher.
This discrimination may be dropped if the driver is past a certain age.
On 1 March 2011, the European Court of Justice decided insurance companies who used gender as a risk factor when calculating insurance premiums were breaching EU equality laws.
The Court ruled that car-insurance companies were discriminating against men.
However, in some places, such as the UK, companies have used the standard practice of discrimination based on profession to still use gender as a factor, albeit indirectly.
Professions which are more typically practised by men are deemed as being more risky even if they had not been prior to the Court's ruling while the converse is applied to professions predominant among women.
Another effect of the ruling has been that, while the premiums for men have been lowered, they have been raised for women.
This equalisation effect has also been seen in other types of insurance for individuals, such as life insurance.
Teenage drivers who have no driving record will have higher car insurance premiums.
However, young drivers are often offered discounts if they undertake further driver training on recognized courses, such as the Pass Plus scheme in the UK.
In the US many insurers offer a good-grade discount to students with a good academic record and resident-student discounts to those who live away from home.
Generally insurance premiums tend to become lower at the age of 25.
Some insurance companies offer "stand alone" car insurance policies specifically for teenagers with lower premiums.
By placing restrictions on teenagers' driving (forbidding driving after dark, or giving rides to other teens, for example), these companies effectively reduce their risk.
Senior drivers are often eligible for retirement discounts, reflecting the lower average miles driven by this age group.
However, rates may increase for senior drivers after age 65, due to increased risk associated with much older drivers.
Typically, the increased risk for drivers over 65 years of age is associated with slower reflexes, reaction times, and being more injury-prone.
In most U.S. states, moving violations, including running red lights and speeding, assess points on a driver's driving record.
Since more points indicate an increased risk of future violations, insurance companies periodically review drivers' records, and may raise premiums accordingly.
Rating practices, such as debit for a poor driving history, are not dictated by law.
Many insurers allow one moving violation every three to five years before increasing premiums.
Crashes affect insurance premiums similarly.
Depending on the severity of the crash and the number of points assessed, rates can increase by as much as twenty to thirty percent.
Any motoring convictions should be disclosed to insurers, as the driver is assessed by risk from prior experiences while driving on the road.
Statistics show that married drivers average fewer crashes than the rest of the population so policy owners who are married often receive lower premiums than single persons.
The profession of the driver may be used as a factor to determine premiums.
Certain professions may be deemed more likely to result in damages if they regularly involve more travel or the carrying of expensive equipment or stock or if they are predominant either among women or among men.
Two of the most important factors that go into determining the underwriting risk on motorized vehicles are: performance capability and retail cost.
The most commonly available providers of auto insurance have underwriting restrictions against vehicles that are either designed to be capable of higher speeds and performance levels, or vehicles that retail above a certain dollar amount.
Vehicles that are commonly considered luxury automobiles usually carry more expensive physical damage premiums because they are more expensive to replace.
Vehicles that can be classified as high performance autos will carry higher premiums generally because there is greater opportunity for risky driving behavior.
Motorcycle insurance may carry lower property-damage premiums because the risk of damage to other vehicles is minimal, yet have higher liability or personal-injury premiums, because motorcycle riders face different physical risks while on the road.
Risk classification on automobiles also takes into account the statistical analysis of reported theft, accidents, and mechanical malfunction on every given year, make, and model of auto.
Some car insurance plans do not differentiate in regard to how much the car is used.
There are however low-mileage discounts offered by some insurance providers.
Other methods of differentiation would include over-road distance between the ordinary residence of a subject and their ordinary, daily destinations.
Another important factor in determining car insurance premiums involves the annual mileage put on the vehicle, and for what reason.
Driving to and from work every day at a specified distance, especially in urban areas where common traffic routes are known, presents different risks than how a retiree who does not work any longer may use their vehicle.
Common practice has been that this information was provided solely by the insured person, but some insurance providers have started to collect regular odometer readings to verify the risk.
Cents Per Mile Now (1986) advocates classified odometer-mile rates, a type of usage-based insurance.
After the company's risk factors have been applied, and the customer has accepted the per-mile rate offered, then customers buy prepaid miles of insurance protection as needed, like buying gallons of gasoline (litres of petrol).
Insurance automatically ends when the odometer limit (recorded on the car's insurance ID card) is reached, unless more distance is bought.
Customers keep track of miles on their own odometer to know when to buy more.
The company does no after-the-fact billing of the customer, and the customer does not have to estimate a "future annual mileage" figure for the company to obtain a discount.
In the event of a traffic stop, an officer could easily verify that the insurance is current, by comparing the figure on the insurance card to that on the odometer.
As a practical matter, resetting odometers requires equipment plus expertise that makes stealing insurance risky and uneconomical.
For example, to steal 20,000 miles [32,200 km] of continuous protection while paying for only the 2000 in the 35000 to 37000 range on the odometer, the resetting would have to be done at least nine times, to keep the odometer reading within the narrow 2,000-mile [3,200 km] covered range.
There are also powerful legal deterrents to this way of stealing insurance protection.
Odometers have always served as the measuring device for resale value, rental and leasing charges, warranty limits, mechanical breakdown insurance, and cents-per-mile tax deductions or reimbursements for business or government travel.
Odometer tampering, detected during claim processing, voids the insurance and, under decades-old state and federal law, is punishable by heavy fines and jail.
Under the cents-per-mile system, rewards for driving less are delivered automatically, without the need for administratively cumbersome and costly GPS technology.
Uniform per-mile exposure measurement for the first time provides the basis for statistically valid rate classes.
Insurer premium income automatically keeps pace with increases or decreases in driving activity, cutting back on resulting insurer demand for rate increases and preventing today's windfalls to insurers, when decreased driving activity lowers costs but not premiums.
The Progressive Corporation launched Snapshot to give drivers a customized insurance rate based on recording how, how much, and when their car is driven.
Snapshot is currently available in 46 states plus the District of Columbia.
Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.
Driving data is transmitted to the company using an on-board telematic device.
The device connects to a car's OnBoard Diagnostic (OBD-II) port (all petrol automobiles in the USA built after 1996 have an OBD-II.)
and transmits speed, time of day and number of miles the car is driven.
Cars that are driven less often, in less-risky ways, and at less-risky times of day, can receive large discounts.
Progressive has received patents on its methods and systems of implementing usage-based insurance and has licensed these methods and systems to other companies.
Metromile also uses an OBDII-based system for their mileage-based insurance.
They offer a true pay-per-mile insurance where behavior or driving style is not taken into account, and the user only pays a base rate along with a fixed rate per mile.
The OBD-II device measures mileage and then transmits mileage data to servers.
This is supposed  to be an affordable car insurance policy for low-mileage drivers.
Metromile is currently only offering personal car insurance policies and is available in California, Oregon, Washington, and Illinois.
Insurance companies have started using credit ratings of their policyholders to determine risk.
Drivers with good credit scores get lower insurance premiums, as it is believed that they are more financially stable, more responsible and have the financial means to better maintain their vehicles.
Those with lower credit scores can have their premiums raised or insurance canceled outright.
It has been shown that good drivers with spotty credit records could be charged higher premiums than bad drivers with good credit records.
The use of non-intrusive load monitoring to detect drunk driving and other risky behaviors has been proposed.
A US patent application combining this technology with a usage-based insurance product to create a new type of behavior based auto insurance product is currently open for public comment on peer to patent.
See Behavior-based safety.
Behaviour based Insurance focusing upon driving is often called Telematics or Telematics2.0 in some cases monitoring focus upon behavioural analysis such as smooth driving.
Auto repair insurance is an extension of car insurance available in all 50 of the United States that covers the natural wear and tear on a vehicle, independent of damages related to a car crash.
Some drivers opt to buy the insurance as a means of protection against costly breakdowns unrelated to a crash.
In contrast to more standard and basic coverages such as comprehensive and collision insurance, auto repair insurance does not cover a vehicle when it is damaged in a collision, during a natural disaster or at the hands of vandals.
For many it is an attractive option for protection after the warranties on their cars expire.
Providers can also offer sub-divisions of auto repair insurance.
There is standard repair insurance which covers the wear and tear of vehicles, and naturally occurring breakdowns.
Some companies will only offer mechanical breakdown insurance, which only covers repairs necessary when breakable parts need to be fixed or replaced.
These parts include transmissions, oil pumps, pistons, timing gears, flywheels, valves, axles and joints.
In several countries insurance companies offer direct repair programs (DRP) so that their customers have easy access to a recommended car body repair shop.
Some also offer one-stop shopping where a damaged car can get dropped off and an adjuster handles the claim, the car is fixed and often a replacement rental car is provided.
When repairing the vehicle the car body repair shop is obliged to follow the instructions regarding the choice of original equipment manufacturer (OEM), original equipment supplier parts (OES), Matching Quality spare parts (MQ) and generic replacement parts.
Both DRPs and non OEM parts help to keep costs down and keep insurance prices competitive.
AIRC (International Car body repair Association)
General Secretary Karel Bukholczer made clear that DRP's have had big impact on car body repair shops.
Waste (or wastes) are unwanted or unusable materials.
Waste is any substance discarded after primary use, or is worthless, defective and of no use.
A by-product, by contrast is a joint product of relatively minor economic value.
A waste product may become a by-product, joint product or resource through an invention that raises a waste product's value above zero.
Examples include municipal solid waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, wastewater (such as sewage, which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine) and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others.
What constitutes waste depends on the eye of the beholder; one person's waste can be a resource for another person.
Though waste is a physical object, its generation is a physical and psychological process.
The definitions used by various agencies are as below.
According to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal of 1989, Art. 2(1), "'Wastes' are substance or objects, which are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of or are required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law".
Under the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC, Art. 3(1), the European Union defines waste as "an object the holder discards, intends to discard or is required to discard."
For a more structural description of the Waste Directive, see the European Commission's summary.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development also known as OECD defines municipal solid waste (MSW) as "waste collected and treated by or for municipalities".
Typically this type of waste includes household waste, commercial waste, and demolition or construction waste.
In 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that 292.4 tons of municipal waste was generated which equated to about 4.9 pounds per day per person.
Out of the 292.4 tons, approximately 69 million tons were recycled, and 25 million tons were composted.
Household waste more commonly known as trash or garbage are items that are typically thrown away daily from ordinary households.
Items often included in this category include product packaging, yard waste, clothing, food scraps, appliance, paints, and batteries.
Most of the items that are collected by municipalities end up in landfills across the world.
In the United States, it is estimated that 11.3 million tons of textile waste is generated.
On an individual level, it is estimated that the average American throws away 81.5 pounds of clothes each year.
As online shopping becomes more prevalent, items such as cardboard, bubble wrap, shipping envelopes are ending up in landfills across the United States.
The EPA has estimated that approximately 10.1 million tons of plastic containers and packaging ended up landfills in 2018.
The EPA noted that only 30.5% of plastic containers and packaging was recycled or combusted as an energy source.
Additionally, approximately 940,000 pounds of cardboard ends up in the landfill each year.
Commercial waste is very similar to household waste.
To be considered as commercial waste, it must come from a business or commercial occupancy.
This can be restaurants, retail occupants, manufacturing occupants or similar businesses.
Typically, commercial waste contains similar items such as food scraps, cardboard, paper, and shipping materials.
Generally speaking, commercial waste creates more waste than household waste on a per location basis.
The EPA defines this type of waste as "Construction and Demolition (C&D) debris is a type of waste that is not included in municipal solid waste (MSW)."
Items typically found in C&D include but are not limited to steel, wood products, drywall and plaster, brick and clay tile, asphalt shingles, concrete, and asphalt.
Generally speaking, construction and demolition waste can be categorized as any components needed to build infrastructures.
In 2018, the EPA estimated that the US generated approximately 600 million tons of C&D waste.
The waste generated by construction and demolition is often intended to be reused or is sent to the landfill.
Examples of reused waste is milled asphalt can be used again for the asphalt mixture or fill dirt can be used to level grade.
The EPA defines hazardous waste as "a waste with properties that make it dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment."
Hazardous Waste falls under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
Under the RCRA, the EPA has the authority to control hazardous waste during its entire lifecycle.
This means from the point of creation to the point where it has been properly disposed of.
The life cycle of hazardous waste includes generation, transportation, treatment, and storage and disposal.
All of which are included in the RCRA.
Some forms of hazardous waste include radioactive waste, explosive waste, and electronic waste.
Radioactive waste, often referred to as nuclear waste, is produced by various industries such as nuclear power plants, nuclear reactors, hospitals, research centers, and mining facilities.
Any activity that involves radioactive material can generate radioactive waste.
Furthermore, such waste emits radioactive particles, which if not handled correctly, can be both an environmental hazard as well as a human health hazard.
When dealing with radioactive waste, it is extremely important to understand the necessary protocols and follow the correct precautions.
Failure to handle and recycle these materials can have catastrophic consequences and potentially damage the site's ecosystems for years to come.
Radioactive waste is monitored and regulated by multiple governmental agencies such as Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Department of the Interior (DOI).
Each agency plays an important role in creating, handling, and properly disposing of radioactive waste.
A brief description of each agency's role can be found below.
The US currently defines five types of radioactive waste, as shown below.
High-level Waste: This type of radioactive waste is generated from nuclear reactors or reprocessing spent nuclear fuel.
Transuranic Waste:
This type of radioactive waste is man-made and has an atomic number of 92 or higher.
Uranium or thorium mill tailings:
This type of radioactive waste is a result after the mining or milling or uranium or thorium ore.
Low-level waste: This type of radioactive waste is radioactively contaminated waste.
It is typically generated from industrial processes or research.
Examples of these items include paper, protective clothing, bags, and cardboard.
Technologically enhanced naturally-occurring radioactive material (TENORM):
This type of radioactive waste is created through human activity such as mining, oil and gas drilling, and water treatment where naturally-occurring radiological material (NORM) becomes concentrated.
The EPA defines energetic hazardous waste as "wastes that have the potential to detonate and bulk military propellants which cannot safely be disposed of through other modes of treatments."
The items which typically fall under this category include munitions, fireworks, flares, hobby rockets, and automobile propellants.
Munitions were added to hazardous waste in 1997 when the EPA finalized RCRA.
A special rule was added to address munitions in waste.
This new rule is commonly referred to as the Military Munitions Rule.
The EPA defines military munitions as "all types of both conventional and chemical ammunition products and their components, produced by or for the military for national defense and security (including munitions produced by other parties under contract to or acting as an agent for DOD—in the case of Government Owned/Contractor Operated [GOCO] operations)."
The entire rule can be found here.
While a large percentage of munitions waste is generated by the government or governmental contractors, residents also throw away expired or faulty ammunition inside their household waste.
Every year, the US generates this type of waste from both the commercial and consumer aspects.
This waste is often generated from fireworks, signal flares and hobby rockets which have been damaged, failed to operate or for other reasons.
Due to their chemical properties, these types of devices are extremely dangerous.
While automobile airbag propellants are not as common as munitions and fireworks, they share similar properties which makes them extremely hazardous.
Airbag propellants characteristics of reactivity and ignitability are the characteristics which qualify for hazardous waste.
When disposed undeployed, leaves these two hazardous characteristics intact.
To properly dispose of these items, they must be safely deployed which removes these hazardous characteristics.
The EPA includes the waste of automobile airbag propellants under the RCRA.
In 2018, the EPA issued a final rule on handling of automobile airbag propellants.
The "interim final rule"provides an exemption of entities which install and remove airbags.
This includes automobile dealerships, salvage yards, automobile repair facilities and collision centers.
The handler and transporter are exempt from RCRA, but the airbag waste collection facility is not exempt.
Once the airbags have met the collection center, it will then be classified as RCRA hazardous waste and must be disposed or recycled at a RCRA disposal facility.
Electronic waste, often referred to as "E-Waste" or "E-Scrap," are often thrown away or sent to a recycler.
E-Waste continues to end up in landfills across the world.
The EPA estimates that in 2009, 2.37 million tons of televisions, computers, cell phones, printers, scanners, and fax machines were discarded by US consumers.
Only 25% of these devices were recycled; the remainder ended up in landfills across the US.
E-Waste contains many elements that can be recycled or re-used.
Typically speaking, electronics are encased in a plastic or light metal enclosure.
Items such as computer boards, wiring, capacitors, and small motor items are common types of E-waste.
Of these items, the internal components include iron, gold, palladium, platinum, and copper, all of which are mined from the earth.
It requires energy to operate the equipment to mine these metals, which emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Donating e-waste to recycling centers or refurbishing this equipment can reduce the greenhouse gases emitted through the mining process as well as decrease the use of natural resources to ensure future generations will have sufficient access to these resources.
4.     Reducing harmful exports of e-waste and building capacity in developing countries.
E-Waste is not only a problem in the US, but also a global issue.
Tackling this issue requires collaboration from multiple agencies across the world.
Some agencies involved in this include U.S. EPA, Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (Taiwan EPA), International E-Waste Management Network (IEMN), and environmental offices from Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and North America.
Mixed waste is a term that has different definitions based its context.
Most commonly, Mixed Waste refers to hazardous waste which contains radioactive material.
In this context, the management of mixed waste is regulated by the EPA and RCRA and Atomic Energy Act.
The Hazardous materials content is regulated by RCRA while the radiological component is regulated by the Department of Energy (DOE) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
Mixed waste can also be defined as a type of waste which includes recyclable materials and organic materials.
Some examples of mixed waste in this context include a combination of broken glassware, floor sweepings, non-repairable household goods, non-recyclable plastic and metal, and clothing and furnishings.
Additionally, ashes and soot, residential renovation waste materials are also included under this definition.
There are many issues that surround reporting waste.
It is most commonly measured by size or weight, and there is a stark difference between the two.
For example, organic waste is much heavier when it is wet, and plastic or glass bottles can have different weights but be the same size.
On a global scale it is difficult to report waste because countries have different definitions of waste and what falls into waste categories, as well as different ways of reporting.
Based on incomplete reports from its parties, the Basel Convention estimated 338 million tonnes of waste was generated in 2001.
For the same year, OECD estimated 4 billion tonnes from its member countries.
Despite these inconsistencies, waste reporting is still useful on a small and large scale to determine key causes and locations, and to find ways of preventing, minimizing, recovering, treating, and disposing of waste.
Inappropriately managed waste can attract rodents and insects, which can harbor gastrointestinal parasites, yellow fever, worms, various diseases, and other conditions for humans, and exposure to hazardous wastes, particularly when they are burned, can cause various other diseases including cancers.
Toxic waste materials can contaminate surface water, groundwater, soil, and air, which causes more problems for humans, other species, and ecosystems.
A form of waste disposal involving combustion creates a significant amount of greenhouse gases.
When the burned waste contains metals, it can create toxic gases.
On the other hand, when the waste contains plastics, the gases produce contain CO2.
As global warming and CO2 emissions increase, soil begins to become a larger carbon sink and will become increasingly valuable for plant life.
Waste management is a significant environmental justice issue.
Many of the environmental burdens cited above are more often borne by marginalized groups, such as racial minorities, women, and residents of developing nations.
NIMBY (not in my back yard) is the opposition of residents to a proposal for a new development because it is close to them.
However, the need for expansion and siting of waste treatment and disposal facilities is increasing worldwide.
There is now a growing market in the transboundary movement of waste, and although most waste that flows between countries goes between developed nations, a significant amount of waste is moved from developed to developing nations.
The economic costs of managing waste are high, and are often paid for by municipal governments; money can often be saved with more efficiently designed collection routes, modifying vehicles, and with public education.
Environmental policies such as pay as you throw can reduce the cost of management and reduce waste quantities.
Waste recovery (that is, recycling, reuse) can curb economic costs because it avoids extracting raw materials and often cuts transportation costs.
"Economic assessment of municipal waste management systems – case studies using a combination of life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC)".
The location of waste treatment and disposal facilities often reduces property values due to noise, dust, pollution, unsightliness, and negative stigma.
The informal waste sector consists mostly of waste pickers who scavenge for metals, glass, plastic, textiles, and other materials and then trade them for a profit.
This sector can significantly alter or reduce waste in a particular system, but other negative economic effects come with the disease, poverty, exploitation, and abuse of its workers.
People in developing countries suffer from contaminated water and landfills caused by unlawful government policies that allow first-world countries and companies to transport their trash to their homes and oftentimes near bodies of water.
Those same governments do not use any waste trade profits to create ways to manage landfills or clean water sources.
Photographer Kevin McElvaney documents the world's biggest e-waste dump called Agbogbloshie in Accra, Ghana, which used to be a wetland.
The young men and children that work in Agbogbloshie smash devices to get to the metals, obtain burns, eye damage, lung and back problems, chronic nausea, debilitating headaches, and respiratory problems and most workers die from cancer in their 20s (McElvaney).
In McElvaney's photos, kids in fields burning refrigerators and computers with blackened hands and trashed clothes and animals, such as cows with open wounds, in the dumpsite.
There are piles of waste used as makeshift bridges over lakes, with metals and chemicals just seeping into the water and groundwater that could be linked to homes' water systems.
The same unfortunate situation and dumps/landfills can be seen in similar countries that are considered the third world, such as other West African countries and China.
Many are advocating for waste management, a stop to the waste trade, the creation of wastewater treatment facilities, and providing a clean and accessible water source.
The health of all these people in landfills and water are human necessities/rights that are being taken away.
Wastewater treatment facilities remove pollutants and contaminants physically and chemically to clean water to be returned to society.
The South Gippsland Water Organization breaks down the three steps of waste-water treatment.
The primary treatment is to sift through the water to remove large solids to leave oils and small particles in the water.
Secondary treatment to dissolve/remove oils, particles, and micro-organisms from the water to be prepared for tertiary treatment to chemically disinfect the water with chlorine or with UV light.
“For most industrial applications, a 150,000 GPD capacity WWTS would cost an estimated $500,000 to $1.5 million inclusive of all necessary design, engineering, equipment, installation, and startup”.
With such a simple solution that has been proven to clean water to be reused and is relatively inexpensive, there is no excuse why there should not be a waste-water treatment facility in every country, every state, and every town.
“Right now, according to a NASA-led study, many of the world’s freshwater sources are being drained faster than they are being replenished.
The water table is dropping all over the world.
There's not an infinite supply of water”.
There is a need to preserve every resource, every finite water source that we do have left to maintain our lives and lifestyles.
Able countries helping under-developed countries with their creation of wastewater treatments benefits society.
Another cost of not adding wastewater treatments in countries is that people have no choice but to clean with, cook with, or drink the contaminated water which has caused millions of cases of disease and deaths.
“Between 400,000 and 1 million people die each year in developing countries because of diseases caused by mismanaged waste, estimates poverty charity Tearfund”.
Society has the means to decrease or even eliminate this way of death and save millions of lives by providing the simple human necessity of clean water.
Energy recovery from waste is using non-recyclable waste materials and extracting from it heat, electricity, or energy through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, and anaerobic digestion.
This process is referred to as waste-to-energy.
There are several ways to recover energy from waste.
Anaerobic digestion is a naturally occurring process of decomposition where organic matter is reduced to a simpler chemical component in the absence of oxygen.
Incineration or direct controlled burning of municipal solid waste reduces waste and makes energy.
Secondary recovered fuel is the energy recovery from waste that cannot be reused or recycled from mechanical and biological treatment activities.
Pyrolysis involves heating of waste, with the absence of oxygen, to high temperatures to break down any carbon content into a mixture of gaseous and liquid fuels and solid residue.
Gasification is the conversion of carbon rich material through high temperature with partial oxidation into a gas stream.
Plasma arc heating is the very high heating of municipal solid waste to temperatures ranging from 3,000 to 10,000°C, where energy is released by an electrical discharge in an inert atmosphere.
Using waste as fuel can offer important environmental benefits.
It can provide a safe and cost-effective option for wastes that would normally have to be dealt with through disposal.
It can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by diverting energy use from fossil fuels, while also generating energy and using waste as fuel can reduce the methane emissions generated in landfills by averting waste from landfills.
There is some debate in the classification of certain biomass feedstock as wastes.
Crude Tall Oil (CTO), a co-product of the pulp and papermaking process, is defined as a waste or residue in some European countries when in fact it is produced “on purpose” and has significant value add potential in industrial applications.
Several companies use CTO to produce fuel, while the pine chemicals industry maximizes it as a feedstock “producing low-carbon, bio-based chemicals” through cascading use.
Education and awareness in the area of waste and waste management is increasingly important from a global perspective of resource management.
The Talloires Declaration is a declaration for sustainability concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental pollution and degradation, and the depletion of natural resources.
Local, regional, and global air pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, soil, and water; depletion of the ozone layer and emission of "green house" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its biodiversity, the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations.
Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing environmental management and waste management programs, e.g. the waste management university project.
University and vocational education are promoted by various organizations, e.g. WAMITAB and Chartered Institution of Wastes Management.
Tire recycling, or rubber recycling, is the process of recycling waste tires that are no longer suitable for use on vehicles due to wear or irreparable damage.
These tires are a challenging source of waste, due to the large volume produced, the durability of the tires, and the components in the tire that are ecologically problematic.
Because tires are highly durable and non-biodegradable, they can consume valuable space in landfills.
If waste tires are improperly managed they may cause rubber pollution.
In 1990, it was estimated that over 1 billion scrap tires were in stockpiles in the United States.
As of 2015, only 67 million tires remain in stockpiles.
From 1994 to 2010, the European Union increased the amount of tires recycled from 25% of annual discards to nearly 95%, with roughly half of the end-of-life tires used for energy, mostly in cement manufacturing.
Pyrolysis and devulcanization could facilitate recycling.
Aside from use as fuel, the main end use for tires remains ground crumb rubber.
In 2017, 13% of U.S. tires removed from their primary use were sold in the used tire market.
Of the tires that were scrapped, 43% were burnt as tire-derived fuel, with cement manufacturing the largest user, another 25% were used to make ground rubber, 8% were used in civil engineering projects, 17% were disposed of in landfills and 8% had other uses.
Globally, tire graveyards are a common environmental hazard, with significant pollutants and other challenges.
For example, the Sulaibiya tire graveyard in Kuwait has had repeat highly toxic fires.
Product developments and innovations such as improved compounds and camber tire shaping increase tire life, increments of replacement, consumer safety, and reduce tire waste.
Proper manufacturing and quality of delivery reduces waste at production.
Direct distribution through retailers, reduces inventory time and ensures that the life span and the safety of the products are explained to customers.
Consumers' use and maintenance choices like tire rotation and alignment affect tire wear and safety of operation.
Manufacturers and retailers set policies on return, retread, and replacement to reduce the waste generated from tires and assume responsibility for taking the 'tire to its grave' or to its reincarnation.
Recycling tires by developing strategies that combust or process waste into new products, creates viable businesses, and fulfilling public policies.
Tires are not desired at landfills, due to their large volumes and 75% void space.
Tires can trap methane gases, causing them to become buoyant, or bubble to the surface.
This 'bubbling' effect can damage landfill liners that have been installed to help keep landfill contaminants from polluting local surface and ground water.
The EU Landfill Directive prohibits the disposal of used tires in landfill.
Shredded tires are now being used in landfills, replacing other construction materials, for a lightweight back-fill in gas venting systems, leachate collection systems, and operational liners.
Shredded tire material may also be used to cap, close, or daily cover landfill sites.
Scrap tires as a back-fill and cover material are also more cost-effective, since tires can be shredded on-site instead of hauling in other fill materials.
Tire stockpiles create a great health and safety risk.
Tire fires can easily occur, burning for long periods, up to a month and also creating substantial pollution in the air and ground.
Recycling helps to reduce the number of tires in storage.
An additional health risk, tire piles provide harborage for vermin and a breeding ground for mosquitoes that may carry diseases.
Illegal dumping of scrap tires pollutes ravines, woods, deserts, and empty lots; which has led many states to pass scrap tire regulations requiring proper management.
Tire amnesty day events, in which community members can deposit a limited number of waste tires free of charge, can be funded by state scrap tire programs, helping decrease illegal dumping and improper storage of scrap tires.
Tire storage and recycling are sometimes linked with illegal activities and lack of environmental awareness.
Although tires are usually burnt, not recycled, efforts are continuing to find value.
Tires can be reclaimed into, among other things, the hot melt asphalt, typically as crumb rubber modifier—recycled asphalt pavement (CRM—RAP), and as an aggregate in Portland cement concrete Efforts have been made to use recycled tires as raw material for new tires, but such tires may integrate recycled materials no more than 5% by weight, and tires that contain recycled material are inferior to new tires, suffering from reduced tread life and lower traction.
Tires have also been cut up and used in garden beds as bark mulch to hold in the water and to prevent weeds from growing.
Some "green" buildings, both private and public, have been made from old tires.
Pyrolysis can be used to reprocess the tires into fuel gas, oils, solid residue (char), and low-grade carbon black, which cannot be used in tire manufacture.
A pyrolysis method which produces activated carbon and high-grade carbon black has been suggested.
Old tires can be used as an alternative fuel in the manufacturing of Portland cement, a key ingredient in concrete.
Whole tires are commonly introduced into cement kilns, by rolling them into the upper end of a preheater kiln, or by dropping them through a slot midway along a long wet kiln.
In either case, the high gas temperatures (1000–1200 °C) cause almost instantaneous, complete and smokeless combustion of the tire.
Alternatively, tires are chopped into 5–10 mm chips, in which form they can be injected into a precalciner combustion chamber.
Some iron input is required in manufacturing cement, so the iron content of steel-belted tires is beneficial to the process.
Tires can be reused in many ways, although most used tires are burnt for their fuel value.
In a 2003 report cited by the U.S. EPA, it is stated that markets ("both recycling and beneficial use") existed for 80.4% of scrap tires, about 233 million tires per year.
Assuming 22.5 pounds (10.2 kg) per tire, the 2003 report predicts a total weight of about 2.62 million tonnes (2,580,000 long tons; 2,890,000 short tons) from tires.
New products derived from waste tires generate more economic activity than combustion or other low multiplier production, while reducing waste stream without generating excessive pollution and emissions from recycling operations.
Construction materials.
Entire homes can be built with whole tires by filling them with earth and covering them with concrete, a common material in earthships.
They are used in civil engineering applications such as sub-grade fill and embankments, back-fill for walls and bridge abutments, sub-grade insulation for roads, landfill projects, and septic system drain fields.
Tires are also bound together and used as different types of barriers such as: collision reduction, erosion control, rainwater runoff, blasting mats, wave action that protects piers and marshes, and sound barriers between roadways and residences.
Artificial reefs are built using tires that are bonded together in groups.
There is some controversy on how effective tires are as an artificial reef system; an example is The Osborne Reef Project which has become an environmental nightmare that will cost millions of dollars to rectify.
The process of stamping and cutting tires is used in some apparel products, such as sandals and as a road sub-base, by connecting together the cut sidewalls to form a flexible net.
The markets predicted by the 2003 report were: tire derived fuel (TDF) using 130 million tires, civil engineering projects using 56 million tires, ground rubber turned into molded rubber products using 18 million tires, ground rubber turned into rubber-modified asphalt using 12 million tires, Exported items using 9 million tires, cut, stamped and punched products using 6.5 million tires, and agricultural and miscellaneous uses 3 million tires.
Shredded tires, known as Tire Derived Aggregate (TDA), have many civil engineering applications.
TDA can be used as a back-fill for retaining walls, fill for landfill gas trench collection wells, back-fill for roadway landslide repair projects as well as a vibration damping material for railway lines.
Ground and crumb rubber, also known as size-reduced rubber, can be used in both paving type projects and in mold-able products.
These types of paving are: Rubber Modified Asphalt (RMA), Rubber Modified Concrete, and as a substitution for an aggregate.
Examples of rubber-molded products are carpet padding or underlay, flooring materials, dock bumpers, patio decks, railroad crossing blocks, livestock mats, sidewalks, rubber tiles and bricks, movable speed bumps, and curbing/edging.
The rubber can be molded with plastic for products like pallets and railroad ties.
Athletic and recreational areas can also be paved with the shock absorbing rubber-molded material.
Rubber from tires is sometimes ground into medium-sized chunks and used as rubber mulch.
Rubber crumb can also be used as an infill, alone or blended with coarse sand, as in infill for grass-like synthetic turf products such as Field-turf.
Steel mills can use tires as a carbon source, replacing coal or coke in steel manufacturing.
Tires are also often recycled for use on basketball courts and new shoe products.
These smaller molecules eventually vaporize and exit from the reactor.
These vapors can be burned directly to produce power or condensed into an oily type liquid, generally used as a fuel.
Some molecules are too small to condense.
They remain as a gas which can be burned as fuel.
The minerals that were part of the tire, about 40% by weight, are removed as solid ashes.
When performed properly, the tire pyrolysis process is a clean operation and produces little emissions or waste; however, concerns about air pollution due to incomplete combustion as is the case with tire fires has been documented.
The properties of the gas, liquid, and solid output are determined by the type of feed-stock used and the process conditions.
For instance whole tires contain fibers and steel.
Shredded tires have most of the steel and sometimes most of the fiber removed.
Processes can be either batch or continuous.
The energy required to drive the decomposition of the rubber include using directly fired fuel (like a gas oven), electrical induction (like an electrically heated oven) or by microwaves (like a microwave oven).
Sometimes a catalyst is used to accelerate the decomposition.
The choice of feed-stock and process can affect the value of the finished products.
The historical issue of tire pyrolysis has been the solid mineral stream, which accounts for about 40% of the output.
The steel can be removed from the solid stream with magnets for recycling.
The remaining solid material, often referred to as "char", has had little or no value other than possibly as a low grade carbon fuel.
Char is the destroyed remains of the original carbon black used to reinforce and provide abrasion resistance to the tire.
The solid stream also includes the minerals used in rubber manufacturing.
This high volume component of tire pyrolysis is a major impediment, although this theme continues to be a source of innovation.
Tires can be frozen using cryogens, or super-cold fluids, then broken down and made into a material called "crumb," which can be used in asphalt road beds, agricultural hoses, and truck bed liners.
Aside from recycling old tires, the old tire can be put to a new use.
Old tires are sometimes converted into a swing for play.
The innovative use allows for an easy way to find a purpose for an existing old tire not suitable for road use.
Used tires are also employed as exercise equipment for athletic programs such as American football.
One classic conditioning drill that hones players' speed and agility is the "Tire Run" where tires are laid out side by side, with each tire on the left a few inches ahead of the tire on the right in a zigzag pattern.
Athletes then run through the tire pattern by stepping in the center of each tire.
The drill forces athletes to lift their feet above the ground higher than normal to avoid tripping.
Other athletic uses include tire flipping (tractor or large truck tires typically used) or for upper cardio conditioning by hitting a tire repetitively with a sledge hammer.
Re-purposed tires can also be harnessed as an affordable alternative building material used in the framework of rammed Earth thermal mass dwellings.
This is beneficial across scales of production such as individually sustainable housing.
Rows of stacks of tires are often used as barriers in motor racing circuits as a method of dissipating kinetic energy over a longer period of time during a crash, comparatively to striking a less malleable material such as a concrete or steel wall.
Many cattle farmers re-purpose old tractor tires as water troughs for their cattle by placing them over natural springs or by piping stream water into them.
These tires contain the water and allow it to pool for the cattle without any additional interaction from the farmer.
Most farmers also include a drainage pipe near the top or in the center of the tire so excess water can drain off to prevent overflow and erosion around the outside of the tire where the cattle would be.
Repurposing as an elastic base for multipurpurposes uses, such as holding advertisement boards, static or swinging.
This is an application still under development and at a prototype stage.
Rubber shingle roofs are typically made from 95% recycled material from a variety of sources including recycled tires.
They last twice as long as asphalt shingles but are about twice the price as asphalt.
They are more quiet than most roofs, hail resistant, and a high wind rating if there is a tongue and groove fitting at the front edge of the rubber shingle design.
Due to their heavy metal and other pollutant content, tires pose a risk for the leaching of toxins into the groundwater when placed in wet soils.
Research has shown that very little leaching occurs when shredded tires are used as light fill material; however, limitations have been put on use of this material; each site should be individually assessed determining if this product is appropriate for given conditions.
For both above and below water table applications, the preponderance of evidence shows that TDA (tire derived aggregate, or shredded tires) will not cause primary drinking water standards to be exceeded for metals.
Moreover, TDA is unlikely to increase levels of metals with primary drinking water standards above naturally occurring background levels.
A Watt's linkage is a type of mechanical linkage invented by James Watt in which the central moving point of the linkage is constrained to travel a nearly straight path.
Watt's described the linkage in his patent specification of 1784 for the Watt steam engine.
Today it is used in automobile suspensions, where it is key to a suspension's kinematics, i.e., its motion properties, constraining the vehicle axle's movement to nearly vertical travel while also limiting horizontal motion.
Watt's linkage consists of three bars bolted together in a chain.
The chain of bars consists of two end bars and a middle bar.
The middle bar is bolted at each of its ends to one of the ends of each outer bar.
The two outer bars are of equal length, and are longer than the middle bar.
The three bars can pivot around the two bolts.
The outer endpoints of the long bars are fixed in place relative to each other, but otherwise the three bars are free to pivot around the two joints where they meet.
In linkage analysis, there is an imaginary fixed-length bar connecting the outer endpoints.
Thus, Watt's linkage is an example of a four-bar linkage.
Its genesis is contained in a letter Watt wrote to Matthew Boulton in June 1784.
I have got a glimpse of a method of causing a piston rod to move up and down perpendicularly by only fixing it to a piece of iron upon the beam, without chains or perpendicular guides [...] and one of the most ingenious simple pieces of mechanics I have invented.
During the Industrial Revolution, mechanisms for converting rotary into linear motion were widely adopted in industrial and mining machinery, locomotives and metering devices.
Such devices had to combine engineering simplicity with a high degree of accuracy, and the ability to operate at speed for lengthy periods.
For many purposes approximate linear motion is an acceptable substitute for exact linear motion.
Perhaps the best known example is the Watt four bar linkage, invented by the Scottish engineer James Watt in 1784.
This type of linkage is one of several types described in Watt's 28 April 1784 patent specification.
However, in his letter to Boulton he was actually describing a development of the linkage which was not included in the patent.
The slightly later design, called a parallel motion linkage, led to a more convenient space-saving design which was actually used in his reciprocating, and his rotary, beam engines.
This linkage does not generate a true straight line motion, and indeed Watt did not claim it did so.
Rather, it traces out Watt's curve, a lemniscate or figure eight shaped curve; when the lengths of its bars and its base are chosen to form a crossed square, it traces the lemniscate of Bernoulli.
In a letter to Boulton on 11 September 1784 Watt describes the linkage as follows.
The convexities of the arches, lying in contrary directions, there is a certain point in the connecting-lever, which has very little sensible variation from a straight line.
Although the Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage, Hart's inversor, and other straight line mechanisms generate true straight-line motion, Watt's linkage has the advantage of much greater simplicity than these other linkages.
It is similar in this respect to the Chebyshev linkage, a different linkage that produces approximate straight-line motion; however, in the case of Watt's linkage, the motion is perpendicular to the line between its two endpoints, whereas in the Chebyshev linkage the motion is parallel to this line.
The earlier single-action beam engines used a chain to connect the piston to the beam and this worked satisfactorily for pumping water from mines, etc.
However, for rotary motion a linkage that works both in compression and tension provides a better design and allows a double-acting cylinder to be used.
Such an engine incorporates a piston acted upon by steam alternately on the two sides, hence doubling its power.
The linkage actually used by Watt (also invented by him) in his later rotary beam engines was called the parallel motion linkage, a development of "Watt's linkage", but using the same principle.
The piston of the engine is attached to the central point of the linkage, allowing it to act on the two outer beams of the linkage both by pushing and by pulling.
The nearly linear motion of the linkage allows this type of engine to use a rigid connection to the piston without causing the piston to bind in its containing cylinder.
This configuration also results in a smoother motion of the beam than the single-action engine, making it easier to convert its back-and-forth motion into rotation.
An example of Watt's linkage can be found on the high and intermediate pressure piston rod of the 1865 Crossness engines.
In these engines, the low pressure piston rod uses the more conventional parallel motion linkage, but the high and intermediate pressure rod does not connect to the end of the beam so there is no requirement to save space.
Watt's linkage is used in the rear axle of some car suspensions as an improvement over the Panhard rod, which was designed in the early twentieth century.
Both methods are intended to prevent relative sideways motion between the axle and body of the car.
Watt's linkage approximates a vertical straight-line motion much more closely, and it does so while consistently locating the centre of the axle at the vehicle's longitudinal centreline, rather than toward one side of the vehicle as would be the case if a simple Panhard rod were used.
It consists of two horizontal rods of equal length mounted at each side of the chassis.
In between these two rods, a short vertical bar is connected.
The center of this short vertical rod – the point which is constrained in a straight line motion - is mounted to the center of the axle.
All pivoting points are free to rotate in a vertical plane.
In a way, Watt's linkage can be seen as two Panhard rods mounted opposite each other.
In Watt's arrangement, however, the opposing curved movements introduced by the pivoting Panhard rods largely balance each other in the short vertical rotating bar.
The linkage can be inverted, in which case the centre P is attached to the body, and L1 and L3 mount to the axle.
This reduces the unsprung mass and changes the kinematics slightly.
This arrangement was used on Australian V8 Supercars until the end of the 2012 season.
Watt's linkage can also be used to prevent axle movement in the longitudinal direction of the car.
This application involves two Watt's linkages on each side of the axle, mounted parallel to the driving direction, but just a single 4-bar linkage is more common in racing suspension systems.
The Volkswagen Passat is a nameplate of large family cars (D-segment) manufactured and marketed by the German automobile manufacturer Volkswagen since 1973.
It has been marketed variously as the Dasher, Santana, Quantum, Magotan, Corsar and Carat, with varying body styles such as saloon, estate, and hatchback.
A "four-door coupé" variant of the Passat with a lower roof was released in the North American market in 2008 as the Passat CC, which was then renamed to Volkswagen CC.
The CC was succeeded by the Arteon in 2017.
In January 2011, Volkswagen introduced a separate Passat model line, internally designated "Volkswagen New Midsize Sedan" or NMS, that was manufactured in the US at the Chattanooga assembly plant and in China at Nanjing by SAIC-Volkswagen.
Developed to increase Volkswagen sales in North America, the Passat NMS is larger and cost less to produce.
sold in the North America, South Korea, China, and Middle East.
The separate B8 Passat model entered production in Europe in 2014, based on the MQB platform.
In 2019, the Passat NMS program was split into two as the North American one continued being produced on an older platform while the Chinese Passat moved on to the MQB platform, which resulted in Volkswagen marketed three models under the Passat nameplate globally at that time.
The North American Passat was discontinued after the 2022 model year.
Volkswagen ended the production of the saloon Passat for the European market in 2022.
The B9 Passat, released in 2023, is only available in an estate body style.
The Passat continues to be available as a saloon in China.
The first generation Passat launched in 1973 in two- and four-door sedan and three- and five-door versions.
Externally all four shared styling by Giorgetto Giugiaro.
The first generation Passat was a fastback variant of the mechanically identical Audi 80 sedan, introduced a year earlier.
A five-door station wagon was introduced in 1974, which in North American markets was sold as an Audi Fox.
In Europe, the Passat was equipped with two rectangular, two round 7-inch, or four round 5.5-inch headlights depending on specification.
The Passat was one of the most modern European family cars at the time, and was intended as a replacement for the ageing Volkswagen Type 3 and Type 4.
The only other European cars of its size to feature front-wheel drive and a hatchback were the Renault 16 and Austin Maxi.
The Passat originally featured the four-cylinder OHC 1.3-litre (55 PS (40 kW; 54 hp)) and 1.5-litre (75 PS (55 kW; 74 hp)/85 PS (63 kW; 84 hp)) petrol engines also used in the Audi 80—longitudinally mounted with front-wheel drive, in Audi tradition, with either a four-speed manual transmission or three-speed automatic.
It had a MacPherson strut front suspension with a solid axle/coil spring setup at the rear.
The SOHC 1.5-litre was enlarged to 1.6-litre in August 1975 with unchanged power ratings and slightly higher torque ratings.
In July 1978, the Passat Diesel became available, equipped with the VW Golf's 1.5-litre diesel (50 PS (37 kW; 49 hp)), followed in February 1979 by the Passat GLI with a fuel-injected version of the 1.6-litre engine.
The range received a facelift in 1977 (launched 1978 outside Europe) with revised interior and revised exterior with repositioned indicators and depending on model, either four round or two rectangular headlights.
In North America, the car was marketed as the Volkswagen Dasher.
The three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and a station wagon model launched in North America for and during the 1974 model year.
Sole available engine was a carburetted 1.5-litre inline-four developing 75 hp (56 kW) (or 70 hp (52 kW) in 1975), supplanted from model year 1976 by a Bosch fuel-injected 1.6-litre four 78 hp (58 kW).
North American cars were equipped with single DOT standard headlights.
In 1978, the Dasher received a facelift along the lines of the European Passat, with quad sealed beam headlights and big polyurethane covered bumpers.
The trim was also upgraded and the ride softened.
1979 saw the introduction of the 1.5-litre diesel engine, which produced just 48 PS (35 kW) in the 1,130 kg (2,490 lb) car.
0–100 km/h time for the Diesel was 19.4 seconds, 6.2 seconds slower than the gasoline (petrol) engine.
All gasoline engines were dropped for North America in 1981, in preparation for the next generation.
In Brazil, the Passat B1 was produced from June 1974 until 1988.
Since the Audi 80 was not marketed in Brazil, the Passat received the Audi's different front-end treatment after a facelift for 1979.
Originally with a 1.5-litre engine, during its long life cycle many improvements from the B2 platform were later introduced, like its 1.6 and 1.8-litre engines, a Brazil-specific face-lift in 1985, and a five-speed gearbox.
A sports version, named Passat TS 1.6 and later Passat GTS 1.8 Pointer was also introduced.
The second generation Passat launched in November 1980.
The platform, named B2, was once again based on the corresponding version of the Audi 80, which had been launched in 1978.
The B2 Passat was slightly longer.
In addition to the Passat hatchbacks and Variants (estate/wagon), there was also a conventional three-box saloon, which until the 1985 facelift was sold as the Volkswagen Santana in Europe.
In the United States, the Passat/Santana was sold as the Volkswagen Quantum, available in three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and a wagon model, but the five-door hatchback was never sold there and the three-door hatchback was dropped after less than two years.
The four-wheel drive Syncro wagon version was introduced in October 1984, initially only with the more powerful five-cylinder engine.
The Passat/Santana was also produced and commercialized in China, Mexico, South America and South Africa, too.
In Mexico, it was marketed from 1984 to 1988 as VW Corsar and Corsar Variant (the 4-door saloon and 5-door wagon, respectively).
In Argentina, from 1987 to 1991 as the VW Carat.
In Brazil, the wagon model was badged VW Quantum.
The Passat saloon and estate were produced in South Africa for the local market until 1987.
Like the previous generation, the B2 Passat was mainly sold with four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines.
Unlike its predecessor, however, top-of the line versions received five-cylinder Audi or VW engines of 1.9–2.2 litres.
In addition to four- and five-speed manuals and three-speed automatic gearboxes, the Passat/Santana was also available with the 4+E transmission.
This, also called the "Formel E" had a particularly long top gear, which combined with a freewheeling mechanism, provided better gas mileage.
An automatic stop/start was also available in some markets.
The four-wheel-drive system used in the Passat Variant Syncro shared the mechanics of the Audi 80 and not the Volkswagen Golf Syncro.
The Syncro's bottom plate was almost entirely different, requiring a transmission tunnel, a relocated gas tank and no spare tire well (to make room for the complex rear axle assembly).
Only the more popular estate was reengineered.
In 1985, the range received a slight facelift, consisting of new, larger bumpers, interior retouches, a new front grille and new taillights on the hatchback versions.
The three-door hatchback was discontinued, while the Santana nameplate was dropped in Europe.
The saloon's front end was now the same as the hatchback and estate.
On 31 March 1988, production ended (although Syncro models continued in production until June) with 3,345,248 built in Germany.
World production totaled approximately 4.5 million units.
The third generation Passat was introduced in March 1988 in Europe, 1990 in North America, and 1995 in South America.
The lack of a grille made the car's front end styling reminiscent of older, rear-engined Volkswagens, such as the 411, and also doubled as a modern styling trend.
The styling was developed from the 1981 aerodynamic (cd 0.25)
Auto 2000 concept car.
At the time, it was the first transverse engine layout Passat to be built on a Volkswagen-designed platform, rather than sharing one with an Audi saloon.
The car, although designated B3 in Volkswagen's platform nomenclature, was based largely on the A platform as used for the smaller Golf model, but was stretched in all directions, and therefore had no connection with the B3 series Audi 80, launched two years earlier.
Many components are shared directly between these vehicles.
This generation of Passat was sold as a four-door saloon or a five-door estate, with the Passat not being sold as a hatchback from this point onwards.
It was marketed under the Passat name in all markets; in North America, this was a first.
The fuel-injected petrol engines gave better performance and refinement than the carburettor units previously used.
They were mounted transversely, and the floorpan was engineered to accept Volkswagen's 'Syncro' four-wheel drive system.
Engine options were the 2.0-litre 16-valve engine in the GL model, 1.8-litre engine in the CL model (not available in North America, all CLs, GLs, and GLSs had the 2.0 16v), The 1.8 8v 112 bhp PB engine from the Golf GTi was also used in the Passat GT model.
Volkswagen's new 2.8-litre VR6 engine (also used in the Golf and Corrado) in the GLX/GLS model (introduced in 1991 in Europe and 1992 in North America), and the G60 engine (only available on the Syncro model in Canada for the North American market).
The VR6 engine gave the top-of-the-range Passat a top speed of 224 kilometres per hour (139 mph).
The 1.9-litre and the 1.6-litre diesel engine were also available as options.
The B3 Passat was heavily facelifted in 1993, and despite being designated B4, it was not an all-new model.
The facelift revised external body panels except for the roof and glasshouse, with most obvious exterior change seeing the reintroduction of a grille to match the style of the other same-generation Volkswagen models of the era, such as the Mk3 Golf and Jetta.
The interior was mildly updated and included safety equipment, such as dual front airbags and seat belt pretensioners, although the basic dashboard design remained unchanged.
The grille was introduced to give the front end a more aggressive appearance, as the previous model looked too 'passive'.
The car was available with a Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine – an inline four-cylinder 1.9-litre turbodiesel, generating 66 kW (90 PS; 89 bhp) at 3,750 rpm and 210 N⋅m (155 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 1,900 rpm.
It carried a US EPA fuel efficiency rating for the sedan of 45 miles per US gallon (5.2 L/100 km; 54 mpg‑imp) highway.
Combined with a 98 litres (21.6 imp gal; 25.9 US gal) 28 litres (6.2 imp gal; 7.4 US gal) reserve option fuel tank, the B4 TDI wagon had an 1800+ km (1200+ mi) range on a single tank of fuel.
The B4 TDI wagon saw less than 1,000 sales in the US during its 1996 to 1997 lifespan.
An all-new Passat, based on the Volkswagen Group B5 platform, was launched in February 1997 in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom, and 1998 in North America.
Its PL45 platform was shared with the first-generation "Typ 8D" Audi A4, which was unveiled two years earlier, and saw a return to the Passat sharing its longitudinal engine layout platform with Audi's equivalent model for the first time since the second-generation (B2) Passat of 1981, which shared its platform with the second-generation "Typ 81" Audi 80/Audi 90 (the A4 is the successor to the Audi 80 line).
The Passat introduced a new design language, first seen on the Concept 1 concept car, for the latest generation of Volkswagens, such as the Mk4 Golf, Bora and Polo Mk4.
Aerodynamic work gave the B5 Passat a coefficient of drag of 0.27 (saloon model).
The car featured a fully independent four-link front suspension; and a semi-independent torsion beam for front-wheel-drive models or a fully independent suspension on the 4motion 4WD models.
4WD was introduced in 1997 as an option for the 1.8-litre, 2.8-litre V6, 1.9-litre TDI, 2.0-litre TDI and 2.5-litre V6 TDI engines, using a second-generation Torsen T-2 based 4WD system to minimise loss of traction.
The 1.8-litre petrol engine in the Passat and Audi A4 has a lower oil capacity than transverse applications of the same engine (4.6 US quarts (4.4 L) in transverse, 4.3 US quarts (4.1 L) longitudinal), and may suffer from oil sludge problems as a result, if not changed at regular intervals with fully synthetic oils.
Four transmission options were available: a 5-speed manual transmission, a 6-speed manual transmission (codename 01E), a 4-speed automatic transmission and a 5-speed automatic transmission with tiptronic.
The 1.6-litre petrol engine had been dropped by 1999, leaving the 1.8-litre 20-valve as the entry-level engine.
The B5.5 Passat began production in late 2000, with styling and mechanical revisions, including revised projector-optic headlights, bumpers, tail lights, and chrome trim.
A 4.0-litre W8 engine producing 275 PS (202 kW) was introduced in 2001 in a luxury version of the car that included standard 4motion all-wheel drive.
This engine was intended to be a test bed for Volkswagen Group's new W engine technology, which would later make an appearance on the W12 in the Phaeton, Audi A8, and Bentley Continental GT, and the W16 engine in the Bugatti Veyron.
The engine was discontinued in 2004.
The B6 debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2005, and launched in Europe in the summer of 2005 for the 2006 model year.
Unlike its predecessor, the B6 Passat no longer shared its platform with Audi's equivalent model (the Audi A4).
Based on a modified version of the Mk5 Golf's PQ35 platform (PQ46), the B6 featured a transverse rather than longitudinal engine layout of its predecessor, like the previous B3 and B4 generations, which were related to the A2 (Golf) platform.
The PQ46 platform provided increased torsional rigidity.
The transverse-engine layout of the four-wheel drive version, marketed as 4motion, dictated a switch from the Torsen centre differential of the B5, to the Haldex Traction multi-plate clutch.
The change to the Haldex system also changes the handling closer to a front-wheel drive car.
Compared to the Torsen, the Haldex can direct torque more unequally to the front wheels (from 100:0 to 50:50 front-to-rear bias), thus providing a wider bias range than the 75:25 to 25:75 of the B5 Passat.
Haldex is a reactive-type system, behaving as a front-wheel-drive vehicle until slippage is detected, at which point up to a maximum of 50% of the torque can be transmitted to the rear axle.
See the Audi-related quattro (four-wheel-drive system) article for more information.
Fuel Stratified Injection is used in every petrol engined version of the Passat, ranging from 1.4 to 3.6 litres (the 1.6-litre DOHC can reach 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 11.4 seconds, and 200 km/h (124.3 mph) for manual transmission versions), but the multi-valve 2.0-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel is the most sought after version in Europe (available in both 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp) and 170 PS (125 kW; 168 hp) variants).
In the US market, a 200 PS (147 kW; 197 hp) 2.0-litre turbocharged I4 is the base engine, or a 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) 3.6-litre VR6 engine as the upgrade, with six-speed manual (only available on the base 2.0-litre turbocharged model) and automatic transmissions.
As of the 2009 model year, the VR6 engine and 4motion option were no longer available in the US on the Passat sedan and wagon, but are available on the Passat CC.
In February 2008, the 2.0 FSI was replaced with the new Audi-developed 1.8-litre TSI engine and 6-speed automatic transmission.
The 1.8-litre T is rated at 160 PS (118 kW; 158 hp) and 250 N⋅m (184 lbf⋅ft) and accelerates from 0–100 km/h in 8.6 seconds, reaching a top speed of 220 km/h (136.7 mph).
At the same time the 2.0-litre TDI engine from the Audi range, incorporating common rail injection technology superseded the existing 2.0 litre TDI units.
The common rail technology uses less fuel and is quieter in operation.
This engine is part of the wider Volkswagen Group policy for engine sharing.
The Passat Estate won overall winner of Practical Caravans Towcar of the Year Awards 2008 for its array of towing features such as its Trailer Stability Programme.
In Asia, the PQ46 Passat was released by FAW-VW as the Magotan, after Volkswagen's other joint venture Shanghai Volkswagen had decided to continue using the B5 platform for the Passat and the Passat Lingyu (long-wheelbase Passat).
Since August 2010, the wagon version of Passat B6 will be offered in Asia, which is a fully imported model.
But this car is simply called Volkswagen Variant in China, in order not to refer the name "Passat" or "Magotan".
Exclusive to Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand was a limited edition Passat R36, which featured a 3.6-litre V6 engine.
This version of the Passat put out 300 hp, and featured dual exhaust tips, an aggressive front bonnet, and All Wheel Drive.
The CC ("Comfort Coupé") is a 4-door coupé version of the Passat.
It debuted at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.
Originally aimed at competing with the similarly styled Mercedes CLS, the Passat CC intends to be more stylish and luxurious than the previously released Passat B6.
In the US, the name Passat was dropped, and the car was being sold as just CC.
Some options specific to the CC include hands-free parking, lane-departure prevention, intelligent cruise control, and adaptive suspension.
Engines offered in the CC mirror those of the regular Passat, with options of the base 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder, or the optional 3.6-litre VR6, which includes 4-motion all-wheel drive.
The Chinese-made CC was released by FAW-VW on 15 July 2010.
Two engine options are provided: 1.8 litre T and 2.0 litre T. Volkswagen facelifted the Passat CC in late 2011 for the 2012 year, with styling updates akin to those of the larger Phaeton.
For the updated model, Volkswagen has dropped the Passat name for all markets, now matching the Volkswagen CC branding used since 2008 in North America.
The B6 Passat was facelifted by Klaus Bischoff and Walter de Silva and was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in September 2010.
Although designated "B7" by VW enthusiasts, the car is not an all-new model.
The facelift resulted in new external body panels except for the roof and glasshouse, with the prominent changes to the grille and headlights.
Overall height and width dimensions are unchanged from the B6 Passat, while length increases by 4 mm.
New features include Adaptive Chassis Control (DCC), Dynamic Light Assist glare-free high beams, a fatigue detection system and an automatic "city emergency braking" system.
It arrived at dealerships in January 2011.
The interior featured minor detail changes from the B6, although the basic dashboard design remained unchanged.
In India, the B6 version is likely to be replaced with the B7 version.
The new model will be exclusive to the Indian market, and at least 100 mm longer than the European B7.
In China, the FAW-VW-built Magotan will also be replaced by a long-wheelbase version of the Passat B7.
The new model will be exclusive to the Chinese market, and at least 100 mm longer than the European B7.
Engines available for Magotan B7L are ranging from 1.4-litre T, 1.8-litre T to 2.0-litre T, a special-developed EA390 3.0-litre VR6 FSI engine is opted for the top model.
In Malaysia, Volkswagen Global had authorised DRB-HICOM for assembly in the Pekan facility beginning 2011.
The Passat was the best-selling model of Volkswagen Malaysia in 2012 and 2013.
In October 2010, Volkswagen presented at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show the Passat Alltrack.
The Passat Alltrack bridges the gap between the passenger VW range and the SUV range comprising the Tiguan and Touareg.
The Passat Alltrack was aimed at competing with Subaru Outback, which created a new market niche.
They (Alltrack & Outback) both bear resemblance in ride height and external body kit.
The Passat Alltrack has raised ground clearance from 135 to 165 mm which improves approach angle from 13.5 to 16 degrees, departure angle from 11.9 to 13.6 degrees and ramp angle from 9.5 to 12.8 degrees when compared to the standard Passat wagon.
Passat Alltrack is the only VW in the passenger range to offer 4Motion with off-road driving programme, the off-road system works in conjunction with the ABS, electronic differential lock (EDL), DSG & hill descent assist system to control the vehicle in an off-road expedition.
The engine range of the Passat Alltrack consists of two 2.0 litre TDI with outputs of 103 kW/140 hp & 125 kW/170 hp and two petrol engines, 1.8-litre producing 118 kW/160 hp and 2.0 litre TSI producing 155 kW/207 hp.
The TDI models come standard with BlueMotion Technology packages with Stop/Start system and battery regeneration mode for recovering braking energy.
The two lesser powered engine variants 2.0 litre TDI and 1.8-litre TSI are only available in front wheel drive format with a manual 6 speed transmission.
The rest of the range with 4Motion has a 6 speed DSG automated manual transmission, except the 2.0 litre TDI with 103 kW/140 hp has an option of 6 speed manual.
In 2012 at the New York Auto Show, VW showed a Passat Alltrack with 2.0 litre TDI 125 kW/170 hp under Alltrack Concept nameplate to gauge response for a future market in the off-road wagon segment.
A driverless version of the Passat Wagon finished second in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge.
In spring 2015, Swiss telecommunications company Swisscom tested the driverless Volkswagen Passat on the streets of Zürich.
The eighth generation model of the Passat was introduced in November 2014 in Continental Europe and in January 2015 in the United Kingdom as a four-door saloon and estate.
Following other Volkswagen Group passenger vehicles such as the Volkswagen Golf Mk7, it is based on a stretched variant of the MQB platform, a modular automobile construction platform designed for transverse, front-engined cars.
To reduce weight, lightweight materials such as aluminium and vacuum-formed steel have been utilised.
According to the chairman of the board of Volkswagen, Martin Winterkorn, the B8 is "a premium car without the premium price", indicating that the Passat nameplate was moved to the small car segment, as opposed to the previous generation models that were conceived as large family cars, although some auto journalists have criticised this strategy since it effectively puts the Passat in competition with the Audi A6.
The Passat was introduced with a great number of advanced driver-assistance systems, including a semi-automatic parking system, emergency driver assistant, which will automatically take control of the vehicle if the driver has suffered a medical emergency, autonomous cruise control system for highway speeds up to 210 km/h, a collision avoidance system with pedestrian monitoring and variable ratio steering marketed as "progressive steering" which will adjust the steering gear ratios in relation to the current speed.
The engine line-up of the Passat B7 was re-introduced with this generation with slightly increased power outputs, variable displacement for the 1.4-litre TSI petrol engine and two selective catalytic reduction (SCR) diesel engines, with one being twin-turbocharged.
A plug-in hybrid, the Passat GTE, with an updated battery pack from the Golf GTE and Audi A3 Sportback e-tron is scheduled for launch in mid-2015 in the United Kingdom with sales commencing in 2016.
Led by new chief of design Walter de Silva and VW's acquisition of coachbuilder Bertone, the 2015 Passat won the 2015 European Car of the Year award.
The Passat B8 continues to be sold in China under the name Magotan; this version has an 80 mm longer wheelbase.
The ninth-generation Passat is available strictly as an estate except for China, where it is also available as a saloon.
Revealed in September 2023, it was the first Passat to be based on a revised version of the MQB platform, and it shares the same bodywork with the ongoing Škoda Superb.
In July, Volkswagen teased the new Passat prototypes, which will be available for sale in early 2024 with petrol, mild hybrid, and diesel engines, as well as two new plug-in hybrids with an electric range of up to 100 km and a new digital cockpit.
The Volkswagen Magotan sedan was unveiled on 25 April 2024, being based on the same platform as the B9 Passat estate sold globally.
The Passat Lingyu is a restyled version of the first generation Škoda Superb for the Chinese market.
Manufactured by SAIC Volkswagen, the Passat Lingyu was introduced in 2005, succeeding the Passat B5.
The car was designed by Istanbul-born car designer Murat Günak.
In 2009, a facelifted version was introduced as the Passat New Lingyu (Xinlingyu).
Production lasted until 2011 and replaced by the Passat NMS.
Volkswagen built 20 examples of a fuel-cell Passat Lingyu in mid-2008 to be presented at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
The Passat branched into two models starting from 2011: one marketed in Europe, right-hand drive markets, and in China as the Magotan, and the other known as the Passat NMS that is manufactured for the North American and Chinese market.
The NMS is more downscale compared to the European Passat to achieve a lower price point and penetrate the mainstream mid-size sedan market.
The Passat NMS model was split again in 2019 as the Chinese version moved on to the MQB platform, while the North American model continued to use its same platform.
Known as the New Midsize Sedan (NMS) before its unveiling in January 2011, this model was designed for the North American market, replacing the B6 Passat sedan and wagon.
At its introduction, the Passat NMS was part of Volkswagen Group's strategy to sell over 800,000 vehicles per year in the North American market.
The Passat NMS is marketed in the North America, South Korea, Middle East, and China, with no plans for a wagon/estate version.
North American, Middle Eastern and South Korean models are manufactured at its Chattanooga Assembly Plant.
In China, the new model is built by SAIC-Volkswagen in its Nanjing factory and is marketed as a more upscale model with some interior and exterior differences to the North American model, such as wood-trimmed steering wheel, rear air vents, and LED accented headlights.
It was sold alongside models such as the long-wheelbase version of the European Passat known as the Magotan and a B5 Passat-based Passat Lingyu.
A revised Passat for the North American market was released in 2019 as a 2020 model.
The 2020 Volkswagen Passat NMS featured revised styling and added standard safety and technology features, which include a suite of standard driver assistance technologies and a 6.33-inch glass-covered touchscreen infotainment system with next-generation VW CarNet 4G LTE in-vehicle telematics.
The 2019 features a carryover 174-horsepower, 2.0-liter TSI I4 gasoline engine and six-speed automatic transmission.
Following the 2022 model year, Volkswagen discontinued the Passat in North America due to slow sales.
In China, the European version Passat is sold as the VW Magotan from the B6 generation, produced by FAW-Volkswagen.
The previous model, sold since 2016 is based on the B8 version of the European Passat, but with a lengthened wheelbase.
The lastest generation based on the B9 version of the European Passat was launched in April 2024.
In October 2018, the Chinese market 2019 Passat was unveiled, using the same Volkswagen Group MQB platform as the European Passat and VW Magotan, but is not directly based on them.
As a result, despite the high physical resemblance between the Chinese and North American Passats (and both being called Passat NMS), they have now diverged and are no longer using the same platform.
The Volkswagen Magotan (China) produced by FAW-VW and Volkswagen Passat NMS (China) produced by SAIC-VW are considered to be near-equivalents, using the same MQB platform and an identical wheelbase of 2871mm, but with slightly different dimensions and different styling.
Trim levels are known as the 280TSI, 330TSI and 380TSI.
280TSI models receive the 1.4-litre EA211 engine, while 330TSI and 380TSI models receive the 2.0-litre EA888 engine.
All models are available with 7-speed DSG gearbox as standard.
Weight distribution is the apportioning of weight within a vehicle, especially cars, airplanes, and trains.
Typically, it is written in the form x/y, where x is the percentage of weight in the front, and y is the percentage in the back.
In a vehicle which relies on gravity in some way, weight distribution directly affects a variety of vehicle characteristics, including handling, acceleration, traction, and component life.
For this reason weight distribution varies with the vehicle's intended usage.
For example, a drag car maximizes traction at the rear axle while countering the reactionary pitch-up torque.
It generates this counter-torque by placing a small amount of counterweight at a great distance forward of the rear axle.
In the airline industry, load balancing is used to evenly distribute the weight of passengers, cargo, and fuel throughout an aircraft, so as to keep the aircraft's center of gravity close to its center of pressure to avoid losing pitch control.
In military transport aircraft, it is common to have a loadmaster as a part of the crew; their responsibilities include calculating accurate load information for center of gravity calculations, and ensuring cargo is properly secured to prevent its shifting.
In large aircraft and ships, multiple fuel tanks and pumps are often used, so that as fuel is consumed, the remaining fuel can be positioned to keep the vehicle balanced, and to reduce stability problems associated with the free surface effect.
In the trucking industry, individual axle weight limits require balancing the cargo when the gross vehicle weight nears the legal limit.
A wheel hub assembly (WHA), also referred to as hub assembly, wheel hub unit, wheel hub bearing, is an automotive part used in most cars, passenger vehicles, and light and heavy trucks.
The hub assembly is located between the brake drums or discs and the drive axle.
A wheel is bolted on it.
Depending on the construction, the end of the hub comes equipped with the splined teeth.
They mate the teeth on the axle shaft.
The axle hub spins along with the wheels bolted to it and provide power to the wheels in order to rotate.
A roller bearing between the axle hub and axle shaft ensures easy rotation of the non-drive wheels.
On the axle side, it is mounted to the holding bracket from the chassis; on the disc side, the wheel is mounted to the bolts of the WHA.
When replacing, a wheel hub assembly should be torqued to the vehicle's specifications to prevent failure.
Wheel hub bearing are used at least since the 1930s when SKF designed a unit used on the Citroën Traction Avant car.
As of 2019 at least 90 million vehicles use SKF wheel hub bearings.
Within piston engines, a wet sump is part of a lubrication system whereby the crankcase sump is used as an integral oil reservoir.
An alternative system is the dry sump, whereby oil is pumped from a shallow sump into an external reservoir.
Piston engines are lubricated by oil which is pumped into various bearings, and thereafter allowed to drain to the base of the engine under gravity.
In most production automobiles and motorcycles, which use a wet sump system, the oil is collected in a 3 to 10 litres (0.66 to 2.20 imp gal; 0.79 to 2.64 US gal) capacity pan at the base of the engine, known as the sump or oil pan, where it is pumped back up to the bearings by the  internal oil pump.
A wet sump offers the advantage of a simple design, using a single pump and no external reservoir.
Since the sump is internal, there is no need for hoses or tubes connecting the engine to an external sump which may leak.
An internal oil pump is generally more difficult to replace, but that is dependent on the engine design.
A wet sump design can be problematic in a racing car, as the large g force pulled by drivers going around corners causes the oil in the pan to slosh, gravitating away from the oil pick-up, briefly starving the system of oil and damaging the engine.
However, on a motorcycle this difficulty does not arise, as a bike leans into corners and the oil is not displaced sideways.
Nevertheless, racing motorcycles usually benefit from dry sump lubrication, as the shallow sump allows the engine to be mounted lower in the frame; and a remote oil tank can allow for improved lubricant cooling.
On some dry sump motorcycles, such as the Yamaha TRX850 and the Yamaha TDM, the oil tank is integral to the engine, sitting atop the gearbox.
Early stationary engines employed a small scoop on the extremity of the crankshaft or connecting rod to assist with the lubrication of the cylinder walls by means of a splashing action.
Modern small engines, such as those used in lawnmowers, use a "slinger" (basically a paddle wheel) to perform the same function.
Small two-stroke engines, such as in motorcycles and lawnmowers, have total loss lubrication.
Such engines use crankcase compression to feed the fuel/air mixture through the crankcase.
This precludes the use of both wet sump and dry sump systems, as excess oil here would contaminate the mixture, leading to excess oil being burned in the engine and so excessive hydrocarbon emissions.
These small engines run on specifically prepared fuel, a mixture of gasoline and two-stroke oil in a ratio recommended by the manufacturer.
In some engines this mixture may also be independently pre-injected into the engine cylinders and bearings by a pump.
Four-stroke engines and large (non-petrol) two-stroke engines used in locomotives and ships may have either wet or dry sumps.
Large two-stroke engines do not use crankcase compression; instead they use a mechanical blower or a turbocharger to aspirate air.
Wheel alignment, which is sometimes referred to as breaking or tracking, is part of standard automobile maintenance that consists of adjusting the angles of wheels to the car manufacturer specifications.
The purpose of these adjustments is to reduce tire wear and to ensure that vehicle travel is straight and true (without "pulling" to one side).
Alignment angles can also be altered beyond the maker's specifications to obtain a specific handling characteristic.
Motorsport and off-road applications may call for angles to be adjusted well beyond normal, for a variety of reasons.
The primary angles are the basic angle alignment of the wheels relative to each other and to the car body.
These adjustments are the camber, caster and toe.
On some cars, not all of these can be adjusted on every wheel.
Setback is the difference between right side and left side wheelbase length.
It can also be measured as an angle.
Setback less than the manufacturer specified tolerance (for example, about 6mm) does not affect car handling.
This is because when the vehicle is turning, one wheel is ahead of the other by several centimetres and therefore the setback is negligible.
There are some car models with different factory setting for right and left side wheelbase length, for various design reasons.
An off-spec setback may occur because of a collision or a difference between right and left caster.
Rake is the difference between the front and rear ride heights, a positive number when the rear ride height is larger.
Often with alignment equipment, these "heads" can be a large precision reflector.
In this case, the alignment "tower" contains the cameras as well as arrays of LEDs.
This system flashes one array of LEDs for each reflector, whilst a camera centrally located in the LED array "looks for" an image of the reflectors patterned face.
These cameras perform the same function as the other style of alignment equipment, yet alleviate numerous issues prone to relocating a heavy precision camera assembly on each vehicle serviced.
Camber is the angle which the vertical axis of the wheel makes with the vertical axis of the vehicle.
This angle is very important for the cornering performance of the vehicles.
Generally, a Camber around   0.5-2 degrees is given on the vehicles.
Depending  upon wheel orientation, Camber can be of three types.
The Camber would be called positive when the top of the wheels lean outwards.
Positive Camber is generally used in off-road vehicles as it improves steering response and decreases steering effort.
Positive Camber is also used in load-carrying vehicles.
This is because the heavy load on these vehicles causes outward-leaning wheels to straighten up, improving the vehicle stability.
The vehicle is said to have zero Camber when the wheels stand perfectly  straight on the ground.
Due to increase in normal reaction, the frictional force on the outer tyres also increase.
This friction acts as centripetal force and tries to bend the outer tires inwards.
The tires get deformed due to bending and the contact area between the wheels and the ground decreases.
This in turns decreases the frictional force between the outer tires and the ground, causing the vehicle to drift during cornering.
Hence a negative Camber is given to the vehicles.
The negatively cambered wheels lean inwards.
So during cornering when the frictional forces try to deform the outer wheels, they just simply get flat on ground, increasing the friction with the road surface.
Walking (also known as ambulation) is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals.
Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits.
Walking is defined by an "inverted pendulum" gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step.
This applies regardless of the usable number of limbs—even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk.
In humans, walking has health benefits including improved mental health and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and death.
The word walk is descended from the Old English wealcan 'to roll'.
In humans and other bipeds, walking is generally distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground and there is a period of double-support.
In contrast, running begins when both feet are off the ground with each step.
This distinction has the status of a formal requirement in competitive walking events.
For quadrupedal species, there are numerous gaits which may be termed walking or running, and distinctions based upon the presence or absence of a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification.
The most effective method to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a person's centre of mass using motion capture or a force plate at mid-stance.
During walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at mid-stance, while running, it is then at a minimum.
This distinction, however, only holds true for locomotion over level or approximately level ground.
For walking up grades above 10%, this distinction no longer holds for some individuals.
Definitions based on the percentage of the stride during which a foot is in contact with the ground (averaged across all feet) of greater than 50% contact corresponds well with identification of 'inverted pendulum' mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any number of limbs, however this definition is incomplete.
Running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a gait cycle when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.
Speed is another factor that distinguishes walking from running.
Although walking speeds can vary greatly depending on many factors such as height, weight, age, terrain, surface, load, culture, effort, and fitness, the average human walking speed at crosswalks is about 5.0 kilometres per hour (km/h), or about 1.4 meters per second (m/s), or about 3.1 miles per hour (mph).
Specific studies have found pedestrian walking speeds at crosswalks ranging from 4.51 to 4.75 km/h (2.80 to 2.95 mph) for older individuals and from 5.32 to 5.43 km/h (3.31 to 3.37 mph) for younger individuals; a brisk walking speed can be around 6.5 km/h (4.0 mph).
In Japan, the standard measure for walking speed is 80 m/min (4.8 km/h).
Champion racewalkers can average more than 14 km/h (8.7 mph) over a distance of 20 km (12 mi).
An average human child achieves independent walking ability at around 11 months old.
Regular, brisk exercise can improve confidence, stamina, energy, weight control and may reduce stress.
Scientific studies have also shown that walking may be beneficial for the mind, improving memory skills, learning ability, concentration, mood, creativity, and abstract reasoning.
Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture may improve health.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's fact sheet on the "Relationship of Walking to Mortality Among U.S. Adults with Diabetes" states that those with diabetes who walked for two or more hours a week lowered their mortality rate from all causes by 39 percent.
Women who took 4,500 steps to 7,500 steps a day seemed to have fewer premature deaths compared to those who only took 2,700 steps a day.
"Walking lengthened the life of people with diabetes regardless of age, sex, race, body mass index, length of time since diagnosis and presence of complications or functional limitations."
One limited study found preliminary evidence of a relationship between the speed of walking and health, and that the best results are obtained with a speed of more than 2.5 mph (4.0 km/h).
A 2023 study by the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, the largest study to date, found that walking at least 2,337 steps a day reduced the risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases, and that 3,967 steps a day reduced the risk of dying from any cause.
Benefits continued to increase with more steps.
James Leiper, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said that if the benefits of walking could be sold as a medicine "we would be hailing it as a wonder drug".
It is theorized that "walking" among tetrapods originated underwater with air-breathing fish that could "walk" underwater, giving rise (potentially with vertebrates like Tiktaalik) to the plethora of land-dwelling life that walk on four or two limbs.
While terrestrial tetrapods are theorised to have a single origin, arthropods and their relatives are thought to have independently evolved walking several times, specifically in hexapods, myriapods, chelicerates, tardigrades, onychophorans, and crustaceans.
Little skates, members of the demersal fish community, can propel themselves by pushing off the ocean floor with their pelvic fins, using neural mechanisms which evolved as early as 420 million years ago, before vertebrates set foot on land.
Data in the fossil record indicate that among hominin ancestors, bipedal walking was one of the first defining characteristics to emerge, predating other defining characteristics of Hominidae.
Judging from footprints discovered on a former shore in Kenya, it is thought possible that ancestors of modern humans were walking in ways very similar to the present activity as long as 3 million years ago.
Today, the walking gait of humans is unique and differs significantly from bipedal or quadrupedal walking gaits of other primates, like chimpanzees.
It is believed to have been selectively advantageous in hominin ancestors in the Miocene due to metabolic energy efficiency.
Human walking has been found to be slightly more energy efficient than travel for a quadrupedal mammal of a similar size, like chimpanzees.
The energy efficiency of human locomotion can be accounted for by the reduced use of muscle in walking, due to an upright posture which places ground reaction forces at the hip and knee.
When walking bipedally, chimpanzees take a crouched stance with bent knees and hips, forcing the quadriceps muscles to perform extra work, which costs more energy.
Comparing chimpanzee quadrupedal travel to that of true quadrupedal animals has indicated that chimpanzees expend one-hundred and fifty percent of the energy required for travel compared to true quadrupeds.
In 2007, a study further explored the origin of human bipedalism, using chimpanzee and human energetic costs of locomotion.
They found that the energy spent in moving the human body is less than what would be expected for an animal of similar size and approximately seventy-five percent less costly than that of chimpanzees.
Chimpanzee quadrupedal and bipedal energy costs are found to be relatively equal, with chimpanzee bipedalism costing roughly ten percent more than quadrupedal.
The same 2007 study found that among chimpanzee individuals, the energy costs for bipedal and quadrupedal walking varied significantly, and those that flexed their knees and hips to a greater degree and took a more upright posture, closer to that of humans, were able to save more energy than chimpanzees that did not take this stance.
Further, compared to other apes, humans have longer legs and short dorsally oriented ischia (hipbone), which result in longer hamstring extensor moments, improving walking energy economy.
Longer legs also support lengthened Achilles tendons which are thought to increase energy efficiency in bipedal locomotor activities.
It was thought that hominins like Ardipithecus ramidus, which had a variety of both terrestrial and arboreal adaptions would not be as efficient walkers, however, with a small body mass A. ramidus had developed an energy efficient means of bipedal walking while still maintaining arboreal adaptations.
Humans have long femoral necks, meaning that while walking, hip muscles do not require as much energy to flex while moving.
These slight kinematic and anatomic differences demonstrate how bipedal walking may have developed as the dominant means of locomotion among early hominins because of the energy saved.
Scrambling is a method of ascending a hill or mountain that involves using both hands, because of the steepness of the terrain.
Of necessity, it will be a slow and careful form of walking and with possibly of occasional brief, easy rock climbing.
Some scrambling takes place on narrow exposed ridges where more attention to balance will be required than in normal walking.
Snow shoeing – Snowshoes are footwear for walking over the snow.
Snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called "flotation".
It is often said by snowshoers that if you can walk, you can snowshoe.
This is true in optimal conditions, but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking.
The method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other, thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing "straddle-gait" that would otherwise be necessary.
A snowshoer must be willing to roll his or her feet slightly as well.
An exaggerated stride works best when starting out, particularly with larger or traditional shoes.
Cross-country skiing – originally conceived like snow shoes as a means of travel in deep snow.
Trails hiked in the summer are often skied in the winter and the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.
Beach walking is a sport that is based on a walk on the sand of the beach.
Beach walking can be developed on compact sand or non-compact sand.
There are beach walking competitions on non-compact sand, and there are world records of beach walking on non-compact sand in Multiday distances.
Beach walking has a specific technique of walk.
Nordic walking is a physical activity and a sport, which is performed with specially designed walking poles similar to ski poles.
Compared to regular walking, Nordic walking (also called pole walking) involves applying force to the poles with each stride.
Nordic walkers use more of their entire body (with greater intensity) and receive fitness building stimulation not present in normal walking for the chest, lats, triceps, biceps, shoulder, abdominals, spinal and other core muscles that may result in significant increases in heart rate at a given pace.
Nordic walking has been estimated as producing up to a 46% increase in energy consumption, compared to walking without poles.
Pedestrianism is a sport that developed during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and was a popular spectator sport in the British Isles.
By the end of the 18th century, and especially with the growth of the popular press, feats of foot travel over great distances (similar to a modern ultramarathon) gained attention, and were labeled "pedestrianism".
Interest in the sport, and the wagering which accompanied it, spread to the United States, Canada, and Australia in the 19th century.
By the end of the 19th century, Pedestrianism was largely displaced by the rise in modern spectator sports and by controversy involving rules, which limited its appeal as a source of wagering and led to its inclusion in the amateur athletics movement.
Pedestrianism was first codified in the last half of the 19th century, evolving into what would become racewalking, By the mid 19th century, competitors were often expected to extend their legs straight at least once in their stride, and obey what was called the "fair heel and toe" rule.
This rule, the source of modern racewalking, was a vague commandment that the toe of one foot could not leave the ground before the heel of the next foot touched down.
This said, rules were customary and changed with the competition.
Racers were usually allowed to jog in order to fend off cramps, and it was distance, not code, which determined gait for longer races.
Newspaper reports suggest that "trotting" was common in events.
Speed walking is the general term for fast walking.
Within the Speed Walking category are a variety of fast walking techniques: Power Walking, Fit Walking, etc.
Power walking is the act of walking with a speed at the upper end of the natural range for walking gait, typically 7 to 9 km/h (4.3 to 5.6 mph).
To qualify as power walking as opposed to jogging or running, at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at all times.
Racewalking is a long-distance athletic event.
Although it is a foot race, it is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times.
Stride length is reduced, so to achieve competitive speeds, racewalkers must attain cadence rates comparable to those achieved by Olympic 800-meter runners, and they must do so for hours at a time since the Olympic events are the 20 km (12 mi) race walk (men and women) and 50 km (31 mi) race walk (men only), and 50-mile (80 km) events are also held.
See also pedestrianism above.
Afghan walking: The Afghan Walk is a rhythmic breathing technique synchronized with walking.
It was born in the 1980s on the basis of the observations made by the Frenchman Édouard G. Stiegler, during his contacts with Afghan caravaners, capable of making walks of more than 60 km per day for dozens of days.
Backward walking: In this activity, an individual walks in reverse, facing away from their intended direction of movement.
This unique form of exercise has gained popularity for its various health and fitness benefits.
It requires more attention and engages different muscles than forward walking, making it a valuable addition to a fitness routine.
Some potential benefits of retro walking include improved balance, enhanced coordination, strengthened leg muscles, and reduced knee stress.
It is also a rehabilitation exercise for certain injuries and can be way to switch up one's workout routine.
Human walking is accomplished with a strategy called the double pendulum.
During forward motion, the leg that leaves the ground swings forward from the hip.
This sweep is the first pendulum.
Then the leg strikes the ground with the heel and rolls through to the toe in a motion described as an inverted pendulum.
The motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always in contact with the ground.
While walking, the muscles of the calf contract, raising the body's center of mass, while this muscle is contracted, potential energy is stored.
Then gravity pulls the body forward and down onto the other leg and the potential energy is then transformed into kinetic energy.
The process of human walking can save approximately sixty-five percent of the energy used by utilizing gravity in forward motion.
Walking differs from a running gait in a number of ways.
The most obvious is that during walking one leg always stays on the ground while the other is swinging.
In running there is typically a ballistic phase where the runner is airborne with both feet in the air (for bipedals).
Another difference concerns the movement of the centre of mass of the body.
In walking the body "vaults" over the leg on the ground, raising the centre of mass to its highest point as the leg passes the vertical, and dropping it to the lowest as the legs are spread apart.
Essentially kinetic energy of forward motion is constantly being traded for a rise in potential energy.
This is reversed in running where the centre of mass is at its lowest as the leg is vertical.
This is because the impact of landing from the ballistic phase is absorbed by bending the leg and consequently storing energy in muscles and tendons.
In running there is a conversion between kinetic, potential, and elastic energy.
There is an absolute limit on an individual's speed of walking (without special techniques such as those employed in speed walking) due to the upwards acceleration of the centre of mass during a stride – if it is greater than the acceleration due to gravity the person will become airborne as they vault over the leg on the ground.
Typically, however, animals switch to a run at a lower speed than this due to energy efficiencies.
Based on the 2D inverted pendulum model of walking, there are at least five physical constraints that place fundamental limits on walking like an inverted pendulum.
These constraints are: take-off constraint, sliding constraint, fall-back constraint, steady-state constraint, high step-frequency constraint.
Many people enjoy walking as a recreation in the mainly urban modern world, and it is one of the best forms of exercise.
For some, walking is a way to enjoy nature and the outdoors; and for others the physical, sporting and endurance aspect is more important.
There are a variety of different kinds of walking, including bushwalking, racewalking, beach walking, hillwalking, volksmarching, Nordic walking, trekking, dog walking and hiking.
Some people prefer to walk indoors on a treadmill, or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count their steps.
Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic.
In the UK, rambling is also used.
Australians also bushwalk.
In English-speaking parts of North America, the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities.
Snow shoeing is walking in snow; a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking.
In terms of tourism, the possibilities range from guided walking tours in cities, to organized trekking holidays in the Himalayas.
In the UK the term walking tour also refers to a multi-day walk or hike undertaken by a group or individual.
Well-organized systems of trails exist in many other European counties, as well as Canada, United States, New Zealand, and Nepal.
Systems of lengthy waymarked walking trails now stretch across Europe from Norway to Turkey, Portugal to Cyprus.
Many also walk the traditional pilgrim routes, of which the most famous is El Camino de Santiago, The Way of St. James.
Numerous walking festivals and other walking events take place each year in many countries.
The world's largest multi-day walking event is the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen in the Netherlands.
The "Vierdaagse" (Dutch for "Four day Event") is an annual walk that has taken place since 1909; it has been based at Nijmegen since 1916.
Depending on age group and category, walkers have to walk 30, 40 or 50 kilometers each day for four days.
Originally a military event with a few civilians, it now is a mainly civilian event.
Numbers have risen in recent years, with over 40,000 now taking part, including about 5,000 military personnel.
Due to crowds on the route, since 2004 the organizers have limited the number of participants.
In the U.S., there is the annual Labor Day walk on Mackinac Bridge, Michigan, which draws over 60,000 participants; it is the largest single-day walking event; while the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Walk in Maryland draws over 50,000 participants each year.
There are also various walks organised as charity events, with walkers sponsored for a specific cause.
These walks range in length from two miles (3 km) or five km to 50 miles (80 km).
The MS Challenge Walk is an 80 km or 50-mile walk which raises money to fight multiple sclerosis, while walkers in the Oxfam Trailwalker cover 100 km or 60 miles.
In Britain, The Ramblers, a registered charity, is the largest organisation that looks after the interests of walkers, with some 100,000 members.
Its "Get Walking Keep Walking" project provides free route guides, led walks, as well as information for people new to walking.
The Long Distance Walkers Association in the UK is for the more energetic walker, and organizes lengthy challenge hikes of 20 or even 50 miles (30 to 80 km) or more in a day.
The LDWA's annual "Hundred" event, entailing walking 100 miles or 160 km in 48 hours, takes place each British Spring Bank Holiday weekend.
There has been a recent focus among urban planners in some communities to create pedestrian-friendly areas and roads, allowing commuting, shopping and recreation to be done on foot.
The concept of walkability has arisen as a measure of the degree to which an area is friendly to walking.
Some communities are at least partially car-free, making them particularly supportive of walking and other modes of transportation.
In the United States, the active living network is an example of a concerted effort to develop communities more friendly to walking and other physical activities.
An example of such efforts to make urban development more pedestrian friendly is the pedestrian village.
This is a compact, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood or town, with a mixed-use village center, that follows the tenets of New Pedestrianism.
Shared-use lanes for pedestrians and those using bicycles, Segways, wheelchairs, and other small rolling conveyances that do not use internal combustion engines.
Generally, these lanes are in front of the houses and businesses, and streets for motor vehicles are always at the rear.
Some pedestrian villages might be nearly car-free with cars either hidden below the buildings or on the periphery of the village.
Venice, Italy is essentially a pedestrian village with canals.
The canal district in Venice, California, on the other hand, combines the front lane/rear street approach with canals and walkways, or just walkways.
Walking is also considered to be a clear example of a sustainable mode of transport, especially suited for urban use and/or relatively shorter distances.
Non-motorized transport modes such as walking, but also cycling, small-wheeled transport (skates, skateboards, push scooters and hand carts) or wheelchair travel are often key elements of successfully encouraging clean urban transport.
A large variety of case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate walking as a means of transportation in cities can be found at Eltis, Europe's portal for local transport.
The development of specific rights of way with appropriate infrastructure can promote increased participation and enjoyment of walking.
Examples of types of investment include pedestrian malls, and foreshoreways such as oceanways and also river walks.
The first purpose-built pedestrian street in Europe is the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam, opened in 1953.
The first pedestrianised shopping centre in the United Kingdom was in Stevenage in 1959.
A large number of European towns and cities have made part of their centres car-free since the early 1960s.
These are often accompanied by car parks on the edge of the pedestrianised zone, and, in the larger cases, park and ride schemes.
Central Copenhagen is one of the largest and oldest: It was converted from car traffic into pedestrian zone in 1962.
Generally, the first successful walking robots had six legs.
As microprocessor technology advanced, the number of legs could be reduced and there are now robots that can walk on two legs.
One, for example, is ASIMO.
Although there has been significant advances, robots still do not walk nearly as well as human beings as they often need to keep their knees bent permanently in order to improve stability.
In 2009, Japanese roboticist Tomotaka Takahashi developed a robot that can jump three inches off the ground.
The robot, named Ropid, is capable of getting up, walking, running, and jumping.
Many other robots have also been able to walk over the years like a bipedal walking robot.
Multiple mathematical models have been proposed to reproduce the kinematics observed in walking.
These may be broadly broken down into four categories: rule-based models based on mechanical considerations and past literature, weakly coupled phase oscillators models, control-based models which guide simulations to maximize some property of locomotion, and phenomenological models which fit equations directly to the kinematics.
The rule-based models integrate the past literature on motor control to generate a few simple rules which are presumed to be responsible for walking (e.g. “loading of the left leg triggers unloading of right leg”).
Such models are generally most strictly based on the past literature and when they are based on a few rules can be easy to interpret.
However, the influence of each rule can be hard to interpret when these models become more complex.
Furthermore, the tuning of parameters is often done in an ad hoc way, revealing little intuition about why the system may be organized in this way.
Finally, such models are typically based fully on sensory feedback, ignoring the effect of descending and rhythm generating neurons, which have been shown to be crucial in coordinating proper walking.
Dynamical system theory shows that any network with cyclical dynamics may be modeled as a set of weakly coupled phase oscillators, so another line of research has been exploring this view of walking.
Each oscillator may model a muscle, joint angle, or even a whole leg, and is coupled to some set of other oscillators.
Often, these oscillators are thought to represent the central pattern generators underlying walking.
These models have rich theory behind them, allow for some extensions based on sensory feedback, and can be fit to kinematics.
However, they need to be heavily constrained to fit to data and by themselves make no claims on which gaits allow the animal to move faster, more robustly, or more efficiently.
Control-based models start with a simulation based on some description of the animal's anatomy and optimize control parameters to generate some behavior.
These may be based on a musculoskeletal model, skeletal model, or even simply a ball and stick model.
As these models generate locomotion by optimizing some metric, they can be used to explore the space of optimal locomotion behaviors under some assumptions.
However, they typically do not generate plausible hypotheses on the neural coding underlying the behaviors and are typically sensitive to modeling assumptions.
Phenomenological models model the kinematics of walking directly by fitting a dynamical system, without postulating an underlying mechanism for how the kinematics are generated neurally.
Such models can produce the most realistic kinematic trajectories and thus have been explored for simulating walking for computer-based animation.
However, the lack of underlying mechanism makes it hard to apply these models to study the biomechanical or neural properties of walking.
The walk is a four-beat gait that averages about 4 miles per hour (6.4 km/h).
When walking, a horse's legs follow this sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular 1-2-3-4 beat.
At the walk, the horse will always have one foot raised and the other three feet on the ground, save for a brief moment when weight is being transferred from one foot to another.
A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.
Ideally, the advancing rear hoof oversteps the spot where the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground.
The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes.
Individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk.
However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.
The fastest "walks" with a four-beat footfall pattern are actually the lateral forms of ambling gaits such as the running walk, singlefoot, and similar rapid but smooth intermediate speed gaits.
If a horse begins to speed up and lose a regular four-beat cadence to its gait, the horse is no longer walking but is beginning to either trot or pace.
Elephants can move both forwards and backwards, but cannot trot, jump, or gallop.
They use only two gaits when moving on land, the walk and a faster gait similar to running.
In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground.
With no "aerial phase", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground.
Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of 18 km/h (11 mph).
At this speed, most other quadrupeds are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length.
Walking fish (or ambulatory fish) are fish that are able to travel over land for extended periods of time.
The term may also be used for some other cases of nonstandard fish locomotion, e.g., when describing fish "walking" along the sea floor, as the handfish or frogfish.
Insects must carefully coordinate their six legs during walking to produce gaits that allow for efficient navigation of their environment.
Interleg coordination patterns have been studied in a variety of insects, including locusts (Schistocerca gregaria), cockroaches (Periplaneta americana), stick insects (Carausius morosus), and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster).
Different walking gaits have been observed to exist on a speed dependent continuum of phase relationships.
Even though their walking gaits are not discrete, they can often be broadly categorized as either a metachronal wave gait, tetrapod gait, or tripod gait.
In a metachronal wave gait, only one leg leaves contact with the ground at a time.
This gait starts at one of the hind legs, then propagates forward to the mid and front legs on the same side before starting at the hind leg of the contralateral side.
The wave gait is often used at slow walking speeds and is the most stable, since five legs are always in contact with the ground at a time.
In a tetrapod gait, two legs swing at a time while the other four legs remain in contact with the ground.
There are multiple configurations for tetrapod gaits, but the legs that swing together must be on contralateral sides of the body.
Tetrapod gaits are typically used at medium speeds and are also very stable.
A walking gait is considered tripod if three of the legs enter the swing phase simultaneously, while the other three legs make contact with the ground.
The middle leg of one side swings with the hind and front legs on the contralateral side.
Tripod gaits are most commonly used at high speeds, though it can be used at lower speeds.
The tripod gait is less stable than wave-like and tetrapod gaits, but it is theorized to be the most robust.
This means that it is easier for an insect to recover from an offset in step timing when walking in a tripod gait.
The ability to respond robustly is important for insects when traversing uneven terrain.
A water footprint shows the extent of water use in relation to consumption by people.
The water footprint of an individual, community, or business is defined as the total volume of fresh water used to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or community or produced by the business.
Water use is measured in water volume consumed (evaporated) and/or polluted per unit of time.
A water footprint can be calculated for any well-defined group of consumers (e.g., an individual, family, village, city, province, state, or nation) or producers (e.g., a public organization, private enterprise, or economic sector), for a single process (such as growing rice) or for any product or service.
Traditionally, water use has been approached from the production side, by quantifying the following three columns of water use: water withdrawals in the agricultural, industrial, and domestic sector.
While this does provide valuable data, it is a limited way of looking at water use in a globalised world, in which products are not always consumed in their country of origin.
International trade of agricultural and industrial products in effect creates a global flow of virtual water, or embodied water (akin to the concept of embodied energy).
In 2002, the water footprint concept was introduced in order to have a consumption-based indicator of water use, that could provide useful information in addition to the traditional production-sector-based indicators of water use.
It is analogous to the ecological footprint concept introduced in the 1990s.
The water footprint is a geographically explicit indicator, not only showing volumes of water use and pollution, but also the locations.
The global issue of water footprinting underscores the importance of fair and sustainable resource management.
Due to increasing water shortages, climate change, and environmental concerns, transitioning towards a fair impact of water use is critical.
The water footprint concept offers detailed insights for adequate and equitable water resource management.
It advocates for a balanced and sustainable water-use approach, aiming to tackle global challenges.
This approach is essential for responsible and equitable water resource utilization globally.
Thus, it gives a grasp on how economic choices and processes influence the availability of adequate water resources and other ecological realities across the globe (and vice versa).
There are many different aspects to water footprint and therefore different definitions and measures to describe them.
Blue water footprint refers to groundwater or surface water usage, green water footprint refers to rainwater, and grey water footprint refers to the amount of water needed to dilute pollutants.
A blue water footprint refers to the volume of water that has been sourced from surface or groundwater resources (lakes, rivers, wetlands and aquifers) and has either evaporated (for example while irrigating crops), or been incorporated into a product or taken from one body of water and returned to another, or returned at a different time.
Irrigated agriculture, industry and domestic water use can each have a blue water footprint.
A green water footprint refers to  the amount of water from precipitation that, after having been stored in the root zone of the soil (green water), is either lost by evapotranspiration or incorporated by plants.
It is particularly relevant for agricultural, horticultural and forestry products.
where L is the pollutant load (as mass flux), cmax the maximum allowable concentration and cnat the natural concentration of the pollutant in the receiving water body (both expressed in mass/volume).
That of a consumer is the sum of footprint of all consumed products.
That of a community or a nation is the sum for all of its members resp.
inhabitants.
That of a business is the footprint of all produced goods.
That of a geographically delineated area is the footprint of all processes undertaken in this area.
The virtual change in water of an area is the net import of virtual water Vi, net, defined as the difference of the gross import Vi of virtual water from its gross export Ve.
The water footprint of national consumption WFarea,nat results from this as the sum of the water footprint of national area and its virtual change in water.
The concept of a water footprint was coined in 2002, by Arjen Hoekstra, Professor in water management at the University of Twente, Netherlands, and co-founder and scientific director of the Water Footprint Network, whilst working at the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, as a metric to measure the amount of water consumed and polluted to produce goods and services along their full supply chain.
Water footprint is one of a family of ecological footprint indicators, which also includes carbon footprint and land footprint.
The water footprint concept is further related to the idea of virtual water trade introduced in the early 1990s by Professor John Allan (2008 Stockholm Water Prize Laureate).
The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004 report on the Water footprint of nations from UNESCO-IHE, the 2008 book Globalization of Water, and the 2011 manual The water footprint assessment manual: Setting the global standard.
Cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the Water Footprint Network in 2008.
The Water Footprint Network is an international learning community (a non-profit foundation under Dutch law) which serves as a platform for sharing knowledge, tools and innovations among governments, businesses and communities concerned about growing water scarcity and increasing water pollution levels, and their impacts on people and nature.
The network consists of around 100 partners from all sectors – producers, investors, suppliers and regulators – as well as non-governmental organisations and academics.
It describes its mission as follows:  To provide science-based, practical solutions and strategic insights that empower companies, governments, individuals and small-scale producers to transform the way we use and share fresh water within earth's limits.
In February 2011, the Water Footprint Network, in a global collaborative effort of environmental organizations, companies, research institutions and the UN, launched the Global Water Footprint Standard.
In July 2014, the International Organization for Standardization issued ISO 14046:2014, Environmental management—Water footprint—Principles, requirements and guidelines, to provide practical guidance to practitioners from various backgrounds, such as large companies, public authorities, non-governmental organizations, academic and research groups as well as small and medium enterprises, for carrying out a water footprint assessment.
The ISO standard is based on life-cycle assessment (LCA) principles and can be applied for different sorts of assessment of products and companies.
Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a systematic, phased approach to assessing the environmental aspects and potential impacts that are associated with a product, process or service.
"Life cycle" refers to the major activities connected with the product's life-span, from its manufacture, use, and maintenance, to its final disposal, and also including the acquisition of raw material required to manufacture the product.
Thus a method for assessing the environmental impacts of freshwater consumption was developed.
It specifically looks at the damage to three areas of protection: human health, ecosystem quality, and resources.
The consideration of water consumption is crucial where water-intensive products (for example agricultural goods) are concerned that need to therefore undergo a life-cycle assessment.
In addition, regional assessments are equally as necessary as the impact of water use depends on its location.
In short, LCA is important as it identifies the impact of water use in certain products, consumers, companies, nations, etc. which can help reduce the amount of water used.
The Water Positive initiative can be defined as the concept where an entity, such as a company, community, or individual, goes beyond simply conserving water and actively contributes to the sustainable management and restoration of water resources.
A commercial or residential development is considered water positive when it generates more water than it consumes.
This involves implementing practices and technologies that reduce water consumption, improve water quality, and enhance water availability.
The goal of being water positive is to leave a positive impact on water ecosystem and ensure that more water is conserved and restored than is used or depleted.
Globally, about 4 percent of precipitation falling on land each year (about 117,000 km3 (28,000 cu mi)), is used by rain-fed agriculture and about half is subject to evaporation and transpiration in forests and other natural or quasi-natural landscapes.
The remainder, which goes to groundwater replenishment and surface runoff, is sometimes called "total actual renewable freshwater resources".
Its magnitude was in 2012 estimated at 52,579 km3 (12,614 cu mi)/year.
It represents water that can be used either in-stream or after withdrawal from surface and groundwater sources.
Of this remainder, about 3,918 km3 (940 cu mi) were withdrawn in 2007, of which 2,722 km3 (653 cu mi), or 69 percent, were used by agriculture, and 734 km3 (176 cu mi), or 19 percent, by other industry.
Most agricultural use of withdrawn water is for irrigation, which uses about 5.1 percent of total actual renewable freshwater resources.
World water use has been growing rapidly in the last hundred years.
The water footprint of a product is the total volume of freshwater used to produce the product, summed over the various steps of the production chain.
The water footprint of a product refers not only to the total volume of water used; it also refers to where and when the water is used.
The Water Footprint Network maintains a global database on the water footprint of products: WaterStat.
Nearly over 70% of the water supply worldwide is used in the agricultural sector.
The water footprints involved in various diets vary greatly, and much of the variation tends to be associated with levels of meat consumption.
The following table gives examples of estimated global average water footprints of popular agricultural products.
The water footprint of a business, the 'corporate water footprint', is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used directly or indirectly to run and support a business.
It is the total volume of water use to be associated with the use of the business outputs.
The water footprint of a business consists of water used for producing/manufacturing or for supporting activities and the indirect water use in the producer's supply chain.
The Carbon Trust argue that a more robust approach is for businesses to go beyond simple volumetric measurement to assess the full range of water impact from all sites.
Its work with leading global pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) analysed four key categories: water availability, water quality, health impacts, and licence to operate (including reputational and regulatory risks) in order to enable GSK to quantitatively measure, and credibly reduce, its year-on-year water impact.
The Coca-Cola Company operates over a thousand manufacturing plants in about 200 countries.
Making its drink uses a lot of water.
Critics say its water footprint has been large.
Coca-Cola has started to look at its water sustainability.
It has now set out goals to reduce its water footprint such as treating the water it uses so it goes back into the environment in a clean state.
Another goal is to find sustainable sources for the raw materials it uses in its drinks, such as sugarcane, oranges, and corn.
By making its water footprint better, the company can reduce costs, improve the environment, and benefit the communities in which it operates.
The water footprint of an individual refers to the sum of their direct and indirect freshwater use.
The direct water use is the water used at home, while the indirect water use relates to the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and services consumed.
The water footprint of a nation is the amount of water used to produce the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of that nation.
Analysis of the water footprint of nations illustrates the global dimension of water consumption and pollution, by showing that several countries rely heavily on foreign water resources and that (consumption patterns in) many countries significantly and in various ways impact how, and how much, water is being consumed and polluted elsewhere on Earth.
International water dependencies are substantial and are likely to increase with continued global trade liberalisation.
The largest share (76%) of the virtual water flows between countries is related to international trade in crops and derived crop products.
Trade in animal products and industrial products contributed 12% each to the global virtual water flows.
The four major direct factors determining the water footprint of a country are: volume of consumption (related to the gross national income); consumption pattern (e.g. high versus low meat consumption); climate (growth conditions); and agricultural practice (water use efficiency).
The assessment of total water use in connection to consumption can be approached from both ends of the supply chain.
The water footprint of production estimates how much water from local sources is used or polluted in order to provide the goods and services produced in that country.
The water footprint of consumption of a country looks at the amount of water used or polluted (locally, or in the case of imported goods, in other countries) in connection with all the goods and services that are consumed by the inhabitants of that country.
The water footprint of production and that of consumption, can also be estimated for any administrative unit such as a city, province, river basin or the entire world.
The absolute water footprint is the total sum of water footprints of all people.
A country's per capita water footprint (that nation's water footprint divided by its number of inhabitants) can be used to compare its water footprint with those of other nations.
The global water footprint in the period 1996–2005 was 9.087 Gm3/
yr (Billion Cubic Metres per year, or 9.087.000.000.000.000 liters/year), of which 74% was and green, 11% blue, 15% grey.
This is an average amount per capita of 1.385 Gm3/yr., or 3.800 liters per person per day.
On average 92% of this is embedded in agricultural products consumed, 4.4% in industrial products consumed, and 3.6% is domestic water use.
The global water footprint related to producing goods for export is 1.762 Gm3/y. The internal water footprint is the amount of water used from domestic water resources; the external water footprint is the amount of water used in other countries to produce goods and services imported and consumed by the inhabitants of the country.
When assessing the water footprint of a nation, it is crucial to take into account the international flows of virtual water (also called embodied water, i.e. the water used or polluted in connection to all agricultural and industrial commodities) leaving and entering the country.
When taking the use of domestic water resources as a starting point for calculating a nation's water footprint, one should subtract the virtual water flows that leave the country and add the virtual water flows that enter the country.
The external part of a nation's water footprint varies strongly from country to country.
Some African nations, such as Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi and Chad have hardly any external water footprint, simply because they have little import.
Some European countries on the other hand—e.g. Italy, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands—have external water footprints that constitute 50–80% of their total water footprint.
The agricultural products that on average contribute most to the external water footprints of nations are: bovine meat, soybean, wheat, cocoa, rice, cotton and maize.
The top 10 gross virtual water exporting nations, which together account for more than half of the global virtual water export, are the United States (314 Gm3/year), China (143 Gm3/year), India (125 Gm3/year), Brazil (112 Gm3/year), Argentina (98 Gm3/year), Canada (91 Gm3/year), Australia (89 Gm3/year), Indonesia (72 Gm3/year), France (65 Gm3/year), and Germany (64 Gm3/year).
The top 10 gross virtual water importing nations are the United States (234 Gm3/year), Japan (127 Gm3/year), Germany (125 Gm3/year), China (121 Gm3/year), Italy (101 Gm3/year), Mexico (92 Gm3/year), France (78 Gm3/year), the United Kingdom (77 Gm3/year), and The Netherlands (71 Gm3/year).
Each EU citizen consumes 4,815 litres of water per day on average; 44% is used in power production primarily to cool thermal plants or nuclear power plants.
Energy production annual water consumption in the EU 27 in 2011 was, in billion m3: for gas 0.53, coal 1.54 and nuclear 2.44.
Wind energy avoided the use of 387 million cubic metres (mn m3) of water in 2012, avoiding a cost of €743 million.
Although agriculture's water use includes provision of important terrestrial environmental values (as discussed in the "Water footprint of products" section above), and much "green water" is used in maintaining forests and wild lands, there is also direct environmental use (e.g. of surface water) that may be allocated by governments.
For example, in California, where water use issues are sometimes severe because of drought, about 48 percent of "dedicated water use" in an average water year is for the environment (somewhat more than for agriculture).
Such environmental water use is for keeping streams flowing, maintaining aquatic and riparian habitats, keeping wetlands wet, etc.
The application and interpretation of water footprints may sometimes be used to promote industrial activities that lead to facile criticism of certain products.
For example, the 140 litres required for coffee production for one cup might be of no harm to water resources if its cultivation occurs mainly in humid areas, but could be damaging in more arid regions.
Other factors such as hydrology, climate, geology, topography, population and demographics should also be taken into account.
Nevertheless, high water footprint calculations do suggest that environmental concern may be appropriate.
Many of the criticisms, including the above ones, compare the description of the water footprint of a water system to generated impacts, which is about its performance.
Such a comparison between descriptive and performance factors and indicators is basically flawed.
The use of the term footprint can also confuse people familiar with the notion of a carbon footprint, because the water footprint concept includes sums of water quantities without necessarily evaluating related impacts.
This is in contrast to the carbon footprint, where carbon emissions are not simply summarized but normalized by CO2 emissions, which are globally identical, to account for the environmental harm.
The difference is due to the somewhat more complex nature of water; while involved in the global hydrological cycle, it is expressed in conditions both local and regional through various forms like river basins, watersheds, on down to groundwater (as part of larger aquifer systems).
Furthermore, looking at the definition of the footprint itself, and comparing ecological footprint, carbon footprint and water footprint, we realize that the three terms are indeed legitimate.
Sustainable water use involves the rigorous assessment of all source of clean water to establish the current and future rates of use, the impacts of that use both downstream and in the wider area where the water may be used and the impact of contaminated water streams on the environment and economic well being of the area.
It also involves the implementation of social policies such as water pricing in order to manage water demand.
In some localities, water may also have spiritual relevance and the use of such water may need to take account of such interests.
For example, the Maori believe that water is the source and foundation of all life and have many spiritual associations with water and places associated with water.
On a national and global scale, water sustainability requires strategic and long term planning to ensure appropriate sources of clean water are identified and the environmental and economic impact of such choices are understood and accepted.
The re-use and reclamation of water is also part of sustainability including downstream impacts on both surface waters and ground waters.
Water footprint accounting has advanced substantially in recent years, however, water footprint analysis also needs sustainability assessment as its last phase.
One of the developments is to employ sustainable efficiency and equity ("Sefficiency in Sequity"), which present a comprehensive approach to assessing the sustainable use of water.
Several nations estimate sectoral distribution of use of water withdrawn from surface and groundwater sources.
For example, in Canada, in 2005, 42 billion m3 of withdrawn water were used, of which about 38 billion m3 were freshwater.
Distribution of this use among sectors was: thermoelectric power generation 66.2%, manufacturing 13.6%, residential 9.0%, agriculture 4.7%, commercial and institutional 2.7%, water treatment and distribution systems 2.3%, mining 1.1%, and oil and gas extraction 0.5%.
The 38 billion m3 of freshwater withdrawn in that year can be compared with the nation's annual freshwater yield (estimated as streamflow) of 3,472 billion m3.
Sectoral distribution is different in many respects in the US, where agriculture accounts for about 39% of fresh water withdrawals, thermoelectric power generation 38%, industrial 4%, residential 1%, and mining (including oil and gas) 1%.
Within the agricultural sector, withdrawn water use is for irrigation and for livestock.
Whereas all irrigation in the US (including loss in conveyance of irrigation water) is estimated to account for about 38 percent of US withdrawn freshwater use, the irrigation water used for production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9 percent, and other withdrawn freshwater use for the livestock sector (for drinking, washdown of facilities, etc.) is estimated at about 0.7 percent.
Because agriculture is a major user of withdrawn water, changes in the magnitude and efficiency of its water use are important.
In the US, from 1980 (when agriculture's withdrawn water use peaked) to 2010, there was a 23 percent reduction in agriculture's use of withdrawn water, while US agricultural output increased by 49 percent over that period.
In the US, irrigation water application data are collected in the quinquennial Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, conducted as part of the Census of Agriculture.
Such data indicate great differences in irrigation water use within various agricultural sectors.
For example, about 14 percent of corn-for-grain land and 11 percent of soybean land in the US are irrigated, compared with 66 percent of vegetable land, 79 percent of orchard land and 97 percent of rice land.
In both road and rail vehicles, the wheelbase is the horizontal distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels.
For road vehicles with more than two axles (e.g. some trucks), the wheelbase is  the distance between the steering (front) axle and the centerpoint of the driving axle group.
In the case of a tri-axle truck, the wheelbase would be the distance between the steering axle and a point midway between the two rear axles.
is the gravity constant.
So, for example, when a truck is loaded, its center of gravity shifts rearward and the force on the rear tires increases.
The vehicle will then ride lower.
The amount the vehicle sinks will depend on counter acting forces, like the size of the tires, tire pressure, and the spring rate of the suspension.
is the acceleration (or deceleration if the value is negative).
So, as is common experience, when the vehicle accelerates, the rear usually sinks and the front rises depending on the suspension.
Likewise, when braking the front noses down and the rear rises.
Because of the effect the wheelbase has on the weight distribution of the vehicle, wheelbase dimensions are crucial to the balance and steering.
For example, a car with a much greater weight load on the rear tends to understeer due to the lack of the load (force) on the front tires and therefore the grip (friction) from them.
This is why it is crucial, when towing a single-axle caravan, to distribute the caravan's weight so that down-thrust on the tow-hook is about 100 pounds force (400 N).
Likewise, a car may oversteer or even "spin out" if there is too much force on the front tires and not enough on the rear tires.
Also, when turning there is lateral torque placed upon the tires which imparts a turning force that depends upon the length of the tire distances from the CM.
Thus, in a car with a short wheelbase ("SWB"), the short lever arm from the CM to the rear wheel will result in a greater lateral force on the rear tire which means greater acceleration and less time for the driver to adjust and prevent a spin out or worse.
Wheelbases provide the basis for one of the most common vehicle size class systems.
Some luxury vehicles are offered with long-wheelbase variants to increase the spaciousness and therefore the luxury of the vehicle.
This practice can often be found on full-size cars like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but ultra-luxury vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom and even large family cars like the Rover 75 came with 'limousine' versions.
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair was given a long-wheelbase version of the Rover 75 for official use.
and even some SUVs like the VW Tiguan and Jeep Wrangler are available with long wheelbases.
In contrast, coupé varieties of some vehicles such as the Honda Accord are usually built on shorter wheelbases than the sedans they are derived from.
The wheelbase on many commercially available bicycles and motorcycles is so short, relative to the height of their centers of mass, that they are able to perform stoppies and wheelies.
In skateboarding the word 'wheelbase' is used for the distance between the two inner pairs of mounting holes on the deck.
This is different from the distance between the rotational centers of the two wheel pairs.
A reason for this alternative use is that decks are sold with prefabricated holes, but usually without trucks and wheels.
It is therefore easier to use the prefabricated holes for measuring and describing this characteristic of the deck.
A common misconception is that the choice of wheelbase is influenced by the height of the skateboarder.
However, the length of the deck would then be a better candidate, because the wheelbase affects characteristics useful in different speeds or terrains regardless of the height of the skateboarder.
For example, a deck with a long wheelbase, say 22 inches (55.9 cm), will respond slowly to turns, which is often desirable in high speeds.
A deck with a short wheelbase, say 14 inches (35.6 cm), will respond quickly to turns, which is often desirable when skating backyard pools or other terrains requiring quick or intense turns.
In rail vehicles, the wheelbase follows a similar concept.
However, since the wheels may be of different sizes (for example, on a steam locomotive), the measurement is taken between the points where the wheels contact the rail, and not between the centers of the wheels.
On vehicles where the wheelsets (axles) are mounted inside the vehicle frame (mostly in steam locomotives), the wheelbase is the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets.
the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets of each bogie.
The wheelbase affects the rail vehicle's capability to negotiate curves.
Short-wheelbased vehicles can negotiate sharper curves.
On some larger wheelbase locomotives, inner wheels may lack flanges in order to pass curves.
The wheelbase also affects the load the vehicle poses to the track, track infrastructure and bridges.
All other conditions being equal, a shorter wheelbase vehicle represents a more concentrated load to the track than a longer wheelbase vehicle.
As railway lines are designed to take a predetermined maximum load per unit of length (tonnes per meter, or pounds per foot), the rail vehicles' wheelbase is designed according to their intended gross weight.
The higher the gross weight, the longer the wheelbase must be.
A wheel hub motor, hub motor, or in-wheel motor is a motor that is incorporated into the hub of the wheel.
Wheel-hub motors are commonly found on electric bicycles.
Electric hub motors were well-received in early electric cars, but have not been commercially successful in modern production cars because they negatively affect vehicle handling due to higher dynamic wheel load and their placement makes them prone to damage.
Patents for electric bicycles with hub motors were granted as early as 1895.
Bicycle hub motors are simple, durable, and affordable compared to other designs, but less suitable for high speeds.
Hub motors rose in popularity over other designs in the late 2000s and 2010s.
Several electric, combustion, and steam powered in-wheel motor designs were patented in the 1880s and 1890s.
Among those who were awarded patents: Wellington Adams of St. Louis in 1884; Edward Parkhurst of Woburn in 1890; Albert Parcelle later in 1890; Charles Theryc in 1896, who cites no transmission losses thanks to an absence of classic transmission rods from engines to wheels; C F Goddard in 1896 who cites a piston hub motor for horseless carriages powered by expanding gas of some kind; and W C Smith in 1897 who cites an explosive gas expansion motor inside a wheel hub that utilized cams on a track in the hub to transmit power to the wheel.
An electric wheel hub motor car was raced by Ferdinand Porsche in 1897 in Vienna, Austria.
He developed his first cars as electric cars with electric wheel hub motors that ran on batteries.
A racecar by Lohner–Porsche fitted with four wheel-hub motors debuted at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900.
Alongside it a commercial model was introduced, the Lohner–Porsche Chaise, with two front wheel-hub motors.
It was well-received, and several models based on its design were produced by Lohner and other manufacturers until the 1920s.
Hub motors may be implemented with direct-drive or planetary gears.
They rotate the wheel either through an axial, inrunner, or outrunner rotor design, with either brushed or brushless commutator design.
Hub motors are attractive from a design standpoint because of their flexibility.
They can be used for front-, rear-, or individual-wheel drive.
They are compact and hence allow for more room for passengers, cargo, or other vehicle components.
They allow for better weight distribution compared to a single motor, and they eliminate the need for many of the drive components in traditional vehicles like transmissions, differentials, and axles, which reduces wear and mechanical losses.
High-voltage in-wheel motors must be robust against damage to their high-voltage cables and components.
One disadvantage of a wheel hub motor is that the weight of the motor is not supported by the suspension's shock absorbers, adding to the vehicle's unsprung weight which adversely affects handling and ride quality.
Despite this reduction in ride quality with electric hub motors, it is still better than the ride quality of equivalent combustion engine vehicles, but vehicle handling is still negatively affected due to higher dynamic wheel load.
Protean Electric and Lotus found that most negative effects of added unsprung mass could be eliminated by adding suspension damping, and that the ability to utilize accurate torque vectoring actually improved car's handling so much that the net effect of the whole arrangement was positive.
Without being supported by the suspension's shock absorbers, in-wheel motors are themselves less shielded both from shocks and debris, reducing their durability.
Some designs reduce unsprung weight by reducing the weight of the motor, for example by using a coreless design or Litz wire coil windings.
These weight-saving designs may have a negative effect on motor durability.
Similar to in-wheel motors, electric vehicles can be designed with near-wheel motors, sometimes called wheel-end motors.
This design shares the same advantages as in-wheel motors while avoiding unsprung weight and wear issues, as the motors are near the wheels but inside the chassis, supported by the suspension.
Near-wheel motors are less compact than in-wheel motors, but as of 2022 they are more reliable and more cost-effective, they avoid the risks associated with out-of-chassis high-voltage components, and they simplify vehicle design and assembly.
American Axle has developed 100 kW and 150 kW wheel-end motors through a project funded by the United States Department of Energy for the commercialization of clean-energy low-cost wheel-end motors.
Costs were lowered by integrating the motor, inverter, and gear reduction into a single unit, and by avoiding heavy rare earth elements.
The 100 kW 3-in-1 wheel-end drive unit has become commercially available in the REE Automotive vehicle product line.
An early modern concept car utilizing electric hub motors was the IZA, presented in at the IEEE conference in 1997, built with four 25 kW (34 hp) motors.
Other concept cars presented at auto shows include: Chevrolet Sequel, 2005; Mitsubishi MIEV, 2005; Hi-Pa Drive Mini QED, 2006; Honda FCX concept, 2005; Citroën C-Métisse, 2006; Protean Electric Ford F-150, 2008; Heuliez WILL using the Michelin Active Wheel suspension, 2008; Peugeot BB1, 2009; Hiriko Fold, shown in 2012, a folding urban car with a maximum speed of 50 km/h (31 mph) with a motor, steering actuators, suspension, and brake integrated into each wheel, controlled with a drive-by-wire system; FlatFormer, a concept 6x6 autonomous truck chassis, shown in 2019; and various vehicles by Indigo Technologies since 2019.
Concept cars that were announced without publicly presenting a physical model include: Siemens VDO eCorner concept, 2006; and ZAP-X, 2007.
Lohner–Porsche Chaise, Mixte, and others.
Several models based on this design were produced by Lohner and other manufacturers in the early 1900s.
Lightyear 0, briefly produced in 2022 before its manufacturer filed for bankruptcy.
Lordstown Endurance, briefly produced in 2022 before its manufacturer filed for bankruptcy.
Aptera, a solar powered three wheeler using hub motors from Elaphe Propulsion Technologies is planned, as of 2023, for production in 2024.
BMW plans producing by 2025 a vehicle with in-wheel motors developed by DeepDrive.
Whitewall tires or white sidewall (WSW) tires are tires having a stripe or entire sidewall of white rubber.
These tires were most commonly used from the early 1900s to around the mid 1980s.
The use of whitewall rubber for tire has been traced to a small tire company in Chicago called  Vogue Tyre and Rubber Co that made them for their horse and chauffeur drawn carriages in 1914.
Early automobile tires were made of pure natural rubber with various chemicals mixed into the tread compounds to make them wear better.
The best of these was zinc oxide, a pure white substance that increased traction and also made the entire tire white.
However, the white rubber did not offer sufficient endurance, so carbon black was added to the rubber to greatly increase tread life.
Later, entirely black tires became available, the still extant white sidewalls being covered with a somewhat thin, black colored layer of rubber.
Should a black sidewall tire have been severely scuffed against a curb, the underlying white rubber would be revealed; it is in a similar manner that raised white letter (RWL) tires are made.
The status of whitewall tires versus blackwall tires was originally the reverse of what it later became, with fully black tires requiring a greater amount of carbon black and less effort to maintain a clean appearance these were considered the premium tire; since the black tires first became available they were commonly fitted to many luxury cars through the 1930s.
During the late-1920s gleaming whitewalls contrasted against darker surroundings were considered a stylish, but high-maintenance feature.
The popularity of whitewalls as an option increased during the 1930s.
On April 6, 1934, Ford introduced whitewall tires as an $11.25 (equivalent to $256 in 2023) option on all its new cars.
But automobile designs incorporating streamlining directed visual interest away from tire walls.
The availability of whitewall tires was limited in the U.S. during the supply shortages of raw materials during World War II and the Korean War.
Wide whitewall tires reached their height in popularity by the early-1950s.
The 1957 production version of the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham was fitted with whitewalls that were reduced to a 1" wide stripe floating on the tire sidewall with a black area between this stripe and the wheel rim.
The whitewall stripe width began to diminish as an attempt to reduce the perceived height of the wheel/tire.
During the decade, increasingly lower vehicle heights were in vogue.
During the 1950s, Fender skirts also covered up white wall tires.
Wide whitewalls generally fell out of favor in the U.S. by the 1962 model year.
They continued as an option on the Lincoln Continental for some time thereafter but most common were narrower 3⁄4–1-inch (1.9–2.5 cm) stripe whitewalls.
During the mid-1960s variations on the striped whitewall began to appear; a red/white stripe combination was offered on Thunderbirds and other high-end Fords, and triple white stripe variations were offered on Cadillacs, Lincolns, and Imperials.
Whitewall tires were a popular option on new cars during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as in the replacement market.
In some cases, having whitewall tires were a "must have" to get the right look on a car; and for those who could not afford the real deal, add-ons could be installed over the rim of the wheel that could leak if the pressure was too high.
New tires were wrapped in paper for shipping, to keep the white stripe clean, and for preventing the black of other tires from rubbing on the whitewall side.
Maintaining a clean sidewall was an issue.
Some motorists added aftermarket "curb feelers" that were attached at the bottom of the wheel opening lip to help reduce scraping the whitewall tire against curbs.
By 1968, wide whitewall tires were no longer available on the Chevrolet Corvette; replaced by F70x15 bias-ply nylon cord tires with thin stripes, either a narrow white or narrow red stripe.
The single-sided whitewall remained a desirable option through the 1970s, becoming a hallmark of "traditional luxury".
Radial tires made by Vogue Tyre  featured a narrow whitewall with a thin gold stripe line toward the edge of the tire.
They were most often fitted to luxury cars.
Full-fledged wide whitewalls have made a return within modified car culture.
The resurgence of traditional hot rods, customs, retro, lowriders and resto-cal cars have also contributed to the resurgence in whitewall tires.
Although wide whitewalls are virtually nonexistent as a factory option on modern automobiles, they are still manufactured in original bias-ply or radial form by specialty outlets such as Coker Tire and Vogue Tyre.
The last car available in the United Kingdom with whitewall tires was the Kia Pride.
Some companies manufacture wide whitewall inserts - the so-called "Portawall" inserts are usually sold through Volkswagen Beetle restoration companies.
Another modern incarnation has been tire decals, which can be applied to a normal tire to give the whitewall look.
Modern trends toward more minimal styling, and large wheels favoring very low-profile tires leave little room for a whitewall.
The Lincoln Town Car continued to be offered with a factory whitewall option—a narrow white stripe—until its discontinuation in 2010.
It is not currently offered as a factory option by any car manufacturer, but it is possible to order whitewalls for motorcycles (for example, the 2014–present Indian Chief).
Water cooling is a method of heat removal from components and industrial equipment.
Evaporative cooling using water is often more efficient than air cooling.
Water is inexpensive and non-toxic; however, it can contain impurities and cause corrosion.
Water cooling is commonly used for cooling automobile internal combustion engines and power stations.
Water coolers utilising convective heat transfer are used inside high-end personal computers to lower the temperature of CPUs and other components.
Other uses include the cooling of lubricant oil in pumps; for cooling purposes in heat exchangers; for cooling buildings in HVAC and in chillers.
Water is inexpensive, non-toxic, and available over most of the earth's surface.
Liquid cooling offers higher thermal conductivity than air cooling.
Water has unusually high specific heat capacity among commonly available liquids at room temperature and atmospheric pressure allowing efficient heat transfer over distance with low rates of mass transfer.
Cooling water may be recycled through a recirculating system or used in a single-pass once-through cooling (OTC) system.
Water's high enthalpy of vaporization allows the option of efficient evaporative cooling to remove waste heat in cooling towers or cooling ponds.
Recirculating systems are open if they rely upon evaporative cooling or closed if heat removal is accomplished in heat exchangers, thus with negligible evaporative loss.
A heat exchanger or condenser may separate non-contact cooling water from a fluid being cooled, or contact cooling water may directly impinge on items like saw blades where phase difference allows easy separation.
Environmental regulations emphasize the reduced concentrations of waste products in non-contact cooling water.
Water accelerates the corrosion of metal parts and is a favorable medium for biological growth.
Dissolved minerals in natural water supplies are concentrated by evaporation to leave deposits called scale.
Cooling water often requires the addition of chemicals to minimize corrosion and insulating deposits of scale and biofouling.
Water contains varying amounts of impurities from contact with the atmosphere, soil, and containers.
Being both an electrical conductor and a solvent for metal ions and oxygen, water can accelerate corrosion of machinery being cooled.
Corrosion reactions proceed more rapidly as temperature increases.
Preservation of machinery in the presence of hot water has been improved by addition of corrosion inhibitors including zinc, chromates and phosphates.
The first two have toxicity concerns; and the last has been associated with eutrophication.
Residual concentrations of biocides and corrosion inhibitors are of potential concern for OTC and blowdown from open recirculating cooling water systems.
With the exception of machines with short design life, closed recirculating systems require periodic cooling-water treatment or replacement raising similar concern about ultimate disposal of cooling water containing chemicals used with environmental safety assumptions of a closed system.
Biofouling occurs because water is a favorable environment for many life forms.
Flow characteristics of recirculating cooling water systems encourage colonization by sessile organisms using the circulating supply of food, oxygen and nutrients.
Temperatures may become high enough to support thermophilic populations of organisms such as types of fungi.
Biofouling of heat exchange surfaces can reduce heat transfer rates of the cooling system, and biofouling of cooling towers can alter flow distribution to reduce evaporative cooling rates.
Biofouling may also create differential oxygen concentrations increasing corrosion rates.
OTC and open recirculating systems are more susceptible to biofouling.
Biofouling may be inhibited by temporary habitat modifications.
Temperature differences may discourage the establishment of thermophilic populations in intermittently operated facilities, and intentional short-term temperature spikes may periodically kill less tolerant populations.
Biocides have been commonly used to control biofouling where sustained facility operation is required.
Chlorine may be added in the form of hypochlorite to decrease biofouling in cooling water systems, but is later reduced to chloride to minimize the toxicity of blowdown or OTC water returned to natural aquatic environments.
Hypochlorite is increasingly destructive to wooden cooling towers as pH increases.
Chlorinated phenols have been used as biocides or leached from preserved wood in cooling towers.
Both hypochlorite and pentachlorophenol have reduced effectiveness at pH values greater than 8.
Non-oxidizing biocides may be more difficult to detoxify prior to release of blowdown or OTC water to natural aquatic environments.
Concentrations of polyphosphates or phosphonates with zinc and chromates or similar compounds have been maintained in cooling systems to keep heat exchange surfaces clean enough that a film of gamma iron oxide and zinc phosphate can inhibit corrosion by passivating anodic and cathodic reaction points.
These increase salinity and total dissolved solids, and phosphorus compounds may provide the limiting essential nutrient for algal growth contributing to biofouling of the cooling system or to eutrophication of natural aquatic environments receiving blowdown or OTC water.
Chromates reduce biofouling in addition to effective corrosion inhibition in the cooling water system, but residual toxicity in blowdown or OTC water has encouraged lower chromate concentrations and the use of less-flexible corrosion inhibitors.
Blowdown may also contain chromium leached from cooling towers constructed of wood preserved with chromated copper arsenate.
Total dissolved solids or TDS (sometimes called filterable residue) is reported as the mass of residue remaining when a measured volume of filtered water is evaporated.
Salinity indicates water density or conductivity changes caused by dissolved materials.
Probability of scale formation increases with increasing total dissolved solids.
Solids commonly associated with scale formation are calcium and magnesium both as carbonate and sulfate.
Corrosion rates initially increase with salinity in response to increasing electrical conductivity, but then decrease after reaching a peak as higher levels of salinity decrease dissolved oxygen levels.
Some groundwater contains very little oxygen when pumped from wells, but most natural water supplies include dissolved oxygen.
Increasing oxygen concentrations accelerate corrosion.
Dissolved oxygen approaches saturation levels in cooling towers.
It is beneficial in blowdown or OTC water being returned to natural aquatic environments.
Water ionizes into hydronium (H3O+) cations and hydroxide (OH−) anions.
The concentration of ionized hydrogen (as protonated water) in a cooling water system is reported as the pH level.
Low pH values increase the rate of corrosion; high pH values encourage scale formation.
Amphoterism is uncommon among metals used in water cooling systems, but aluminum corrosion rates increase with pH values above 9.
Galvanic corrosion may be severe in water systems with copper and aluminum components.
Acid can be added to cooling water systems to prevent scale formation if the pH decrease will offset increased salinity and dissolved solids.
Few other cooling applications approach the large volumes of water required to condense low-pressure steam at power stations.
Many facilities, particularly electric power plants, use millions of gallons of water per day for cooling.
Water cooling on this scale may alter natural water environments and create new environments.
Thermal pollution of rivers, estuaries and coastal waters is a consideration when siting such plants.
Water returned to aquatic environments at temperatures higher than the ambient receiving water modifies aquatic habitat by increasing biochemical reaction rates and decreasing the oxygen saturation capacity of the habitat.
Temperature increases initially favor a population shift from species requiring the high-oxygen concentration of cold water to those enjoying the advantages of increased metabolic rates in warm water.
Once-through cooling (OTC) systems may be used on very large rivers or at coastal and estuarine sites.
These power stations put the waste heat into the river or coastal water.
These OTC systems thus rely upon an ample supply of river water or seawater for their cooling needs.
Such facilities are built with intake structures designed for bringing in large volumes of water at a high rate of flow.
These structures tend to also pull in large numbers of fish and other aquatic organisms, which are killed or injured on the intake screens.
Large flow rates may trap slow-swimming organisms including fish and shrimp on screens protecting the small bore tubes of the heat exchangers from blockage.
High temperatures or pump turbulence and shear may kill or disable smaller organisms that pass through the screens entrained with the cooling water.
Ch. A2  More than 1,200 power plants and manufacturing facilities in the U.S. use OTC systems;: 4–4  the intake structures kill billions of fish and other organisms each year.
More-agile aquatic predators consume organisms impinged on the screens; and warm water predators and scavengers colonize the cooling water discharge to feed on entrained organisms.
The U.S. Clean Water Act required the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue regulations on industrial cooling water intake structures.
EPA issued final regulations for new facilities in 2001 (amended 2003), and for existing facilities in 2014.
As an alternative to OTC, industrial cooling towers may use recirculated river water, coastal water (seawater), or well water.
Large mechanical induced-draft or forced-draft cooling towers in industrial plants continuously circulate cooling water through heat exchangers and other equipment where the water absorbs heat.
That heat is then rejected to the atmosphere by the evaporation of some of the water in cooling towers where upflowing air contacts the downflowing water.
The loss of evaporated water into the air exhausted to the atmosphere is replaced by "make-up" fresh river water or fresh cooling water, but the amount of water lost during evaporative cooling may affect the natural habitat for aquatic organisms.
Because the evaporated pure water is replaced by make-up water containing carbonates and other dissolved salts, a portion of the circulating water is continuously discarded as "blowdown" water to minimize the excessive build-up of salts in the circulating water; these blowdown wastes may change the receiving water quality.
The heated coolant mixture can be used to warm the air inside the car by means of the heater core.
Also, the water jacket around an engine is very effective at deadening mechanical noises, making the engine quieter.
An open water cooling system makes use of evaporative cooling, lowering the temperature of the remaining (unevaporated) water.
This method was common in early internal combustion engines until scale buildup was observed from dissolved salts and minerals in the water.
Modern open cooling systems continuously waste a fraction of recirculating water as blowdown to remove dissolved solids at concentrations low enough to prevent scale formation.
Some open systems use inexpensive tap water, but this requires higher blowdown rates than deionized or distilled water.
Purified water systems still require blowdown to remove the accumulation of byproducts of chemical treatment to prevent corrosion and biofouling.
Water for cooling has a boiling point temperature of around 100 degrees C at atmospheric pressure.
Engines operating at higher temperatures may require a pressurized recycle loop to prevent overheating.
Modern automotive cooling systems often operate at 15 psi (103 kPa) to raise the boiling-point of the recycling water coolant and reduce evaporative losses.
The use of water cooling carries the risk of damage from freezing.
Automotive and many other engine cooling applications require the use of a water and antifreeze mixture to lower the freezing point to a temperature unlikely to be experienced.
Antifreeze also inhibits corrosion from dissimilar metals and can increase the boiling point, allowing a wider range of water cooling temperatures.
Its distinctive odor also alerts operators to cooling system leaks and problems that would go unnoticed in a water-only cooling system.
Other less common chemical additives are products to reduce surface tension.
These additives are meant to increase the efficiency of automotive cooling systems.
Such products are used to enhance the cooling of underperforming or undersized cooling systems or in racing where the weight of a larger cooling system could be a disadvantage.
Since approximately 1930 it is common to use water cooling for tubes of powerful transmitters.
As these devices use high operation voltages (around 10 kV), the use of deionized water is required and it has to be carefully controlled.
Modern solid-state transmitters can be built so that even high-power transmitters do not require water cooling.
Water cooling is however also sometimes used for thyristors of HVDC valves, for which the use of deionized water is required.
Water cooling often adds complexity and cost in comparison to air cooling design by requiring a pump, tubing or piping to transport the water, and a radiator, often with fans, to reject the heat to the atmosphere.
Depending on the application, water cooling may create an additional element of risk where leakage from the water coolant recycle loop can corrode or short-circuit sensitive electronic components.
The primary advantage of water cooling for cooling CPU cores in computing equipment is transporting heat away from the source to a secondary cooling surface to allow for large, more optimally designed radiators rather than small, relatively inefficient fins mounted directly on the heat source.
Cooling hot computer components with various fluids has been in use since at least the  Cray-2 in 1982, which used Fluorinert.
Through the 1990s, water cooling for home PCs slowly gained recognition among enthusiasts, but it became noticeably more prevalent after the introduction of the first Gigahertz-clocked processors in the early 2000s.
As of 2018, there are dozens of manufacturers of water cooling components and kits, and many computer manufacturers include preinstalled water cooling solutions for their high-performance systems.
Water cooling can be used for many computer components, but usually it is used for the CPU and GPUs.
Water cooling typically uses a water block, a water pump, and a water-to-air heat exchanger.
By transferring device heat to a separate larger heat exchanger using larger, lower-speed fans, water cooling can allow quieter operation, improved processor speeds (overclocking), or a balance of both.
Less commonly, Northbridges, Southbridges, hard disk drives, memory, voltage regulator modules (VRMs), and even power supplies can be water-cooled.
Internal radiator size may vary: from 40 mm dual fan (80 mm) to 140 quad fan (560 mm) and thickness from 30 mm to 80 mm.
Radiator fans may be mounted on one or both sides.
External radiators can be much larger than their internal counterparts as they do not need to fit in the confines of a computer case.
High-end cases may have two rubber grommeted ports in the back for the inlet and outlet hoses, which allow external radiators to be placed far away from the PC.
Water coolers for desktop computers were, until the end of the 1990s, homemade.
They were made from car radiators (or more commonly, a car's heater core), aquarium pumps and home-made water blocks, laboratory-grade PVC and silicone tubing and various reservoirs (homemade using plastic bottles, or constructed using cylindrical acrylic or sheets of acrylic, usually clear) and or a T-Line.
More recently a growing number of companies are manufacturing water-cooling components compact enough to fit inside a computer case.
This, and the trend to CPUs of higher power dissipation, has greatly increased the popularity of water cooling.
Dedicated overclockers have occasionally used vapor-compression refrigeration or thermoelectric coolers in place of more common standard heat exchangers.
Water cooling systems in which water is cooled directly by the evaporator coil of a phase change system are able to chill the circulating coolant below the ambient air temperature (impossible with a standard heat exchanger) and, as a result, generally provide superior cooling of the computer's heat-generating components.
The downside of phase-change or thermoelectric cooling is that it uses much more electricity, and antifreeze must be added due to the low temperature.
Additionally, insulation, usually in the form of lagging around water pipes and neoprene pads around the components to be cooled, must be used in order to prevent damage caused by condensation of water vapour from the air on chilled surfaces.
Common places from which to obtain the required phase transition systems are a household dehumidifier or air conditioner.
An alternative cooling scheme, which also enables components to be cooled below the ambient temperature while obviating the requirement for antifreeze and lagged pipes, is to place a thermoelectric device (commonly referred to as a 'Peltier junction' or 'pelt' after Jean Peltier, who documented the effect) between the heat-generating component and the water block.
Because the only sub-ambient temperature zone now is at the interface with the heat-generating component itself, insulation is required only in that localized area.
The disadvantage of such a system is higher power dissipation.
To avoid damage from condensation around the Peltier junction, a proper installation requires it to be "potted" with silicone epoxy.
The epoxy is applied around the edges of the device, preventing air from entering or leaving the interior.
Apple's Power Mac G5 was the first mainstream desktop computer to have water cooling as standard (although only on its fastest models).
Dell followed suit by shipping their XPS computers with liquid cooling, using thermoelectric cooling to help cool the liquid.
Currently, Dell's only computers to offer liquid cooling are their Alienware desktops.
Asus are the first and only mainstream brand to have put water-cooled laptops into mass production.
Those laptops have a built-in air/water hybrid cooling system and can be docked to an external liquid cooling radiator for additional cooling and electrical power.
Water is an ideal cooling medium for vessels as they are constantly surrounded by water that generally remains at a low temperature throughout the year.
Systems operating with seawater need to be manufactured from cupronickel, bronze, titanium or similarly corrosion-resistant materials.
Water containing sediment may require velocity restrictions through piping to avoid erosion at high velocity or blockage by settling at low velocity.
Plant transpiration and animal perspiration use evaporative cooling to prevent high temperatures from causing unsustainable metabolic rates.
Machine guns used in fixed defensive positions sometimes use water cooling to extend barrel life through periods of rapid fire, but the weight of the water and pumping system significantly reduces the portability of water-cooled firearms.
Water-cooled machine guns were extensively used by both sides during World War I; however, by the end of the war lighter weapons that rivaled the firepower, effectiveness and reliability of water-cooled models began to appear on the battlefield.
Thus water-cooled weapons have played a far lesser role in subsequent conflicts.
A hospital in Sweden relies on snow-cooling from melt-water to cool its data centers, medical equipment, and maintain a comfortable ambient temperature.
Some nuclear reactors use heavy water as coolant.
Heavy water is employed in nuclear reactors because it is a weaker neutron absorber.
This allows for the use of less-enriched fuel.
For the main cooling system, normal water is preferably employed through the use of a heat exchanger, as heavy water is much more expensive.
Reactors that use other materials for moderation (graphite) may also use normal water for cooling.
High-grade industrial water (produced by reverse osmosis or distillation) and potable water are sometimes used in industrial plants requiring high-purity cooling water.
Production of these high-purity waters creates waste byproduct brines containing the concentrated impurities from the source water.
In 2018, researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder and University of Wyoming invented a radiative cooling metamaterial known as "RadiCold", which has been developed since 2017.
This metamaterial aids in cooling of water and increasing the efficiency of power generation, in which it would cool the underneath objects, by reflecting away the sun's rays while at the same time allowing the surface to discharge its heat as infrared thermal radiation.
A wheel is a rotating component (typically circular in shape) that is intended to turn on an axle bearing.
The wheel is one of the key components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines.
Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines.
Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel, and flywheel.
Common examples can be found in transport applications.
A wheel reduces friction by facilitating motion by rolling together with the use of axles.
In order for wheels to rotate, a moment needs to be applied to the wheel about its axis, either by way of gravity or by the application of another external force or torque.
Using the wheel, Sumerians later invented a device that spins clay as a potter shapes it into the desired object.
The English word wheel comes from the Old English word hwēol, from Proto-Germanic *hwehwlaz, from Proto-Indo-European *kwékwlos, an extended form of the root *kwel- 'to revolve, move around'.
Cognates within Indo-European include Icelandic hjól 'wheel, tyre', Greek κύκλος kúklos, and Sanskrit chakra, the last two both meaning 'circle' or 'wheel'.
Mesopotamian civilization was originally credited with the invention of the wheel by several, mainly old sources.
However, recent sources either suggest that it was invented independently in both Mesopotamia and Eastern Europe or credit prehistoric Eastern Europeans with the invention of the wheel.
The earliest evidence of the wheel has been found in Europe.
The invention of the solid wooden disk wheel falls into the late Neolithic, and may be seen in conjunction with other technological advances that gave rise to the early Bronze Age.
This implies the passage of several wheelless millennia even after the invention of agriculture and of pottery, during the Aceramic Neolithic.
The Halaf culture of 6500–5100 BCE is sometimes credited with the earliest depiction of a wheeled vehicle, but this is doubtful as there is no evidence of Halafians using either wheeled vehicles or even pottery wheels.
Potter's wheels are thought to have been used in the 4th millennium BCE in the Middle East.
The oldest surviving example so far found of a potter's wheel was found in Ur (modern day Iraq), and dates to approximately 3100 BCE.
However, a potter's wheel in a workshop in Varvarovka in Moldova has been dated to around 4000 BCE, which further precedes the earliest use of the potter's wheel in Mesopotamia.
Wheels of uncertain dates have also been found in the Indus Valley civilization, a 4th millennium BCE civilization covering areas of present-day India and Pakistan.
The oldest indirect evidence of wheeled movement was found in the form of miniature clay wheels north of the Black Sea before 4000 BCE.
From the middle of the 4th millennium BCE onward, the evidence is condensed throughout Europe in the form of toy cars, depictions, or ruts, with the oldest find in Northern Germany dating back to around 3400 BCE.
In Mesopotamia, depictions of wheeled wagons found on clay tablet pictographs at the Eanna district of Uruk, in the Sumerian civilization are dated to c. 3500–3350 BCE.
In the second half of the 4th millennium BCE, evidence of wheeled vehicles appeared near-simultaneously in the Northern (Maykop culture) and South Caucasus and Eastern Europe (Cucuteni-Trypillian culture).
Depictions of a wheeled vehicle appeared between 3631 and 3380 BCE in the Bronocice clay pot excavated in a Funnelbeaker culture settlement in southern Poland.
In nearby Olszanica, a 2.2 m wide door was constructed for wagon entry; this barn was 40 m long with three doors, dated to 5000 BCE, and belonged to the neolithic Linear Pottery culture.
Surviving evidence of a wheel-axle combination, from Stare Gmajne near Ljubljana in Slovenia (Ljubljana Marshes Wooden Wheel), is dated within two standard deviations to 3340–3030 BCE, the axle to 3360–3045 BCE.
Two types of early Neolithic European wheel and axle are known: a circumalpine type of wagon construction (the wheel and axle rotate together, as in Ljubljana Marshes Wheel), and that of the Baden culture in Hungary (axle does not rotate).
They both are dated to c. 3200–3000 BCE.
Some historians believe that there was a diffusion of the wheeled vehicle from the Near East to Europe around the mid-4th millennium BCE.
Early wheels were simple wooden disks with a hole for the axle.
Some of the earliest wheels were made from horizontal slices of tree trunks.
Because of the uneven structure of wood, a wheel made from a horizontal slice of a tree trunk will tend to be inferior to one made from rounded pieces of longitudinal boards.
The spoked wheel was invented more recently and allowed the construction of lighter and swifter vehicles.
The earliest known examples of wooden spoked wheels are in the context of the Sintashta culture, dating to c. 2000 BCE (Krivoye Lake).
Soon after this, horse cultures of the Caucasus region used horse-drawn spoked-wheel war chariots for the greater part of three centuries.
They moved deep into the Greek peninsula where they joined with the existing Mediterranean peoples to give rise, eventually, to classical Greece after the breaking of Minoan dominance and consolidations led by pre-classical Sparta and Athens.
Celtic chariots introduced an iron rim around the wheel in the 1st millennium BCE.
In China, wheel tracks dating to around 2200 BCE have been found at Pingliangtai, a site of the Longshan Culture.
Similar tracks were also found at Yanshi, a city of the Erlitou culture, dating to around 1700 BCE.
The earliest evidence of spoked wheels in China comes from Qinghai, in the form of two wheel hubs from a site dated between 2000 and 1500 BCE.
In Britain, a large wooden wheel, measuring about 1 m (3.3 ft) in diameter, was uncovered at the Must Farm site in East Anglia in 2016.
The specimen, dating from 1,100 to 800 BCE, represents the most complete and earliest of its type found in Britain.
The wheel's hub is also present.
A horse's spine found nearby suggests the wheel may have been part of a horse-drawn cart.
The wheel was found in a settlement built on stilts over wetland, indicating that the settlement had some sort of link to dry land.
Although large-scale use of wheels did not occur in the Americas prior to European contact, numerous small wheeled artifacts, identified as children's toys, have been found in Mexican archeological sites, some dating to approximately 1500 BCE.
Some argue that the primary obstacle to large-scale development of the wheel in the Americas was the absence of domesticated large animals that could be used to pull wheeled carriages.
The closest relative of cattle present in Americas in pre-Columbian times, the American bison, is difficult to domesticate and was never domesticated by Native Americans; several horse species existed until about 12,000 years ago, but ultimately became extinct.
The only large animal that was domesticated in the Western hemisphere, the llama, a pack animal, was not physically suited to use as a draft animal to pull wheeled vehicles, and use of the llama did not spread far beyond the Andes by the time of the arrival of Europeans.
On the other hand, Mesoamericans never developed the wheelbarrow, the potter's wheel, nor any other practical object with a wheel or wheels.
Although present in a number of toys, very similar to those found throughout the world and still made for children today ("pull toys"), the wheel was never put into practical use in Mesoamerica before the 16th century.
Possibly the closest the Mayas came to the utilitarian wheel is the spindle whorl, and some scholars believe that these toys were originally made with spindle whorls and spindle sticks as "wheels" and "axes".
Aboriginal Australians traditionally used circular discs rolled along the ground for target practice.
Nubians from after about 400 BCE used wheels for spinning pottery and as water wheels.
It is thought that Nubian waterwheels may have been ox-driven.
It is also known that Nubians used horse-drawn chariots imported from Egypt.
The spoked wheel was in continued use without major modification until the 1870s, when wire-spoked wheels and pneumatic tires were invented.
Pneumatic tires can greatly reduce rolling resistance and improve comfort.
Wire spokes are under tension, not compression, making it possible for the wheel to be both stiff and light.
Early radially-spoked wire wheels gave rise to tangentially-spoked wire wheels, which were widely used on cars into the late 20th century.
Cast alloy wheels are now more commonly used; forged alloy wheels are used when weight is critical.
The invention of the wheel has also been important for technology in general, important applications including the water wheel, the cogwheel (see also antikythera mechanism), the spinning wheel, and the astrolabe or torquetum.
More modern descendants of the wheel include the propeller, the jet engine, the flywheel (gyroscope) and the turbine.
The normal force at the sliding interface is same as with simple dragging.
The sliding distance is reduced for a given distance of travel.
The coefficient of friction at the interface is usually lower.
If a 100 kg object is dragged for 10 m along a surface with the coefficient of friction μ = 0.5, the normal force is 981 N and the work done (required energy) is (work=force x distance) 981 × 0.5 × 10 = 4905 joules.
Now give the object 4 wheels.
The normal force between the 4 wheels and axles is the same (in total) 981 N. Assume, for wood, μ = 0.25, and say the wheel diameter is 1000 mm and axle diameter is 50 mm.
So while the object still moves 10 m the sliding frictional surfaces only slide over each other a distance of 0.5 m. The work done is 981 × 0.25 × 0.5 = 123 joules; the work done has reduced to 1/40 of that of dragging.
Additional energy is lost from the wheel-to-road interface.
This is termed rolling resistance which is predominantly a deformation loss.
It depends on the nature of the ground, of the material of the wheel, its inflation in the case of a tire, the net torque exerted by the eventual engine, and many other factors.
A wheel can also offer advantages in traversing irregular surfaces if the wheel radius is sufficiently large compared to the irregularities.
The wheel alone is not a machine, but when attached to an axle in conjunction with bearing, it forms the wheel and axle, one of the simple machines.
A driven wheel is an example of a wheel and axle.
Wheels pre-date driven wheels by about 6000 years, themselves an evolution of using round logs as rollers to move a heavy load—a practice going back in pre-history so far that it has not been dated.
The rim is the "outer edge of a wheel, holding the tire".
It makes up the outer circular design of the wheel on which the inside edge of the tire is mounted on vehicles such as automobiles.
For example, on a bicycle wheel the rim is a large hoop attached to the outer ends of the spokes of the wheel that holds the tire and tube.
In the 1st millennium BCE an iron rim was introduced around the wooden wheels of chariots.
The hub is the center of the wheel, and typically houses a bearing, and is where the spokes meet.
A hubless wheel (also known as a rim-rider or centerless wheel) is a type of wheel with no center hub.
More specifically, the hub is actually almost as big as the wheel itself.
The axle is hollow, following the wheel at very close tolerances.
A spoke is one of some number of rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface.
The term originally referred to portions of a log which had been split lengthwise into four or six sections.
The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape.
A spokeshave is a tool originally developed for this purpose.
Eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the wheelwright's work, than to the materials used.
The rims of wire wheels (or "wire spoked wheels") are connected to their hubs by wire spokes.
Although these wires are generally stiffer than a typical wire rope, they function mechanically the same as tensioned flexible wires, keeping the rim true while supporting applied loads.
Wire wheels are used on most bicycles and still used on many motorcycles.
They were invented by aeronautical engineer George Cayley and first used in bicycles by James Starley.
A process of assembling wire wheels is described as wheelbuilding.
A tire (in American English and Canadian English) or tyre (in some Commonwealth Nations such as UK, India, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand) is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance by providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock while keeping the wheel in close contact with the ground.
The word itself may be derived from the word "tie", which refers to the outer steel ring part of a wooden cart wheel that ties the wood segments together (see Etymology above).
The fundamental materials of modern tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric, and wire, along with other compound chemicals.
They consist of a tread and a body.
The tread provides traction while the body ensures support.
Before rubber was invented, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear.
Today, the vast majority of tires are pneumatic inflatable structures, comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion.
Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, such as cars, bicycles, motorcycles, trucks, earthmovers, and aircraft.
Extreme off-road conditions have resulted in the invention of several types of wheel cover, which may be constructed as removable attachments or as permanent covers.
Wheels like this are no longer necessarily round, or have panels that make the ground-contact area flat.
Snow chains - Specially designed chain assemblies that wrap around the tire to provide increased grip, designed for deep snow.
Dreadnaught wheel - A type of permanently attached hinged panels for general extreme off-road use.
These are not connected directly to the wheels, but to each other.
Pedrail wheel - A system of rails that holds panels that hold the vehicle.
These do not necessarily have to be built as a circle (wheel) and are thus also a form of Continuous track.
A version of the above examples (name unknown to the writer) was commonly used on heavy artillery during World War I. Specific examples: Cannone da 149/35 A and the Big Bertha.
These were panels that were connected to each other by multiple hinges and could be installed over a contemporary wheel.
Continuous track - A system of linked and hinged chains/panels that cover multiple wheels in a way that allows the vehicles mass to be distributed across the space between wheels that are positioned in front of / behind other wheels.
"Tire totes" - A bag designed to cover a tire to improve traction in deep snow.
Truck and bus wheels may block (stop rotating) under certain circumstances, such as brake system failure.
To help detect this, they sometimes feature "wheel rotation indicators": colored strips of plastic attached to the rim and protruding out from it, such that they can be seen by the driver in the side-view mirrors.
These devices were invented and patented in 1998 by a Canadian truck shop owner.
The wheel has also become a strong cultural and spiritual metaphor for a cycle or regular repetition (see chakra, reincarnation, Yin and Yang among others).
As such and because of the difficult terrain, wheeled vehicles were forbidden in old Tibet.
The wheel in ancient China is seen as a symbol of health and strength and used by some villages as a tool to predict future health and success.
The diameter of the wheel is indicator of one's future health.
The Kalachakra or wheel of time is also a subject in some forms of Buddhism, along with the dharmachakra.
The winged wheel is a symbol of progress, seen in many contexts including the coat of arms of Panama, the logo of the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the State Railway of Thailand.
The wheel is also the prominent figure on the flag of India.
The wheel in this case represents law (dharma).
It also appears in the flag of the Romani people, hinting to their nomadic history and their Indian origins.
The introduction of spoked (chariot) wheels in the Middle Bronze Age appears to have carried somewhat of a prestige.
The sun cross appears to have a significance in Bronze Age religion, replacing the earlier concept of a solar barge with the more 'modern' and technologically advanced solar chariot.
The wheel was also a solar symbol for the Ancient Egyptians.
In modern usage, the 'invention of the wheel' can be considered as a symbol of one of the first technologies of early civilization, alongside farming and metalwork, and thus be used as a benchmark to grade the level of societal progress.
Some Neopagans such as Wiccans have adopted the Wheel of the Year into their religious practices.
A vehicle registration plate, also known as a number plate (British,  Indian and Australian English) or license plate (American English) or licence plate (Canadian English), is a metal or plastic plate attached to a motor vehicle or trailer for official identification purposes.
All countries require registration plates for road vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles.
Whether they are required for other vehicles, such as bicycles, boats, or tractors, may vary by jurisdiction.
The registration identifier is a numeric or alphanumeric ID that uniquely identifies the vehicle or vehicle owner within the issuing region's vehicle register.
In some countries, the identifier is unique within the entire country, while in others it is unique within a state or province.
Whether the identifier is associated with a vehicle or a person also varies by issuing agency.
There are also electronic license plates.
In Europe, most governments require a registration plate to be attached to both the front and rear of a vehicle, although certain jurisdictions or vehicle types, such as motorcycles, require only one plate, which is usually attached to the rear of the vehicle.
Special vehicles, such as agricultural and construction equipment, might have the license plate attached to other parts of the vehicle.
National databases relate this number to other information describing the vehicle, such as the make, model, colour, year of manufacture, engine size, type of fuel used, mileage recorded (and other similar data in jurisdictions where vehicles are regularly inspected for roadworthiness every year or two), vehicle identification number (chassis number), and the name and address of the vehicle's registered owner or keeper.
In the vast majority of jurisdictions, the government holds a monopoly on the manufacturing of vehicle registration plates for that jurisdiction.
Either a government agency or a private company with express contractual authorization from the government makes plates as needed, which are then mailed to, delivered to, or picked up by the vehicle owners.
Thus, it is normally illegal for private citizens to make and affix their own plates, because such unauthorized private manufacturing is equivalent to forging an official document.
Alternatively, the government will merely assign plate numbers, and it is the vehicle owner's responsibility to find an approved private supplier to make a plate with that number.
Additionally, citizens can create custom plates, following specific guidelines and naming conventions approved by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
In some jurisdictions, plates will be permanently assigned to that particular vehicle for its lifetime.
If the vehicle is either destroyed or exported to a different jurisdiction, the plate number is retired or reissued; exported vehicles must be re-registered in the jurisdiction of import.
China requires the re-registration of any vehicle that crosses its borders from another country, such as for overland tourist visits, regardless of the length of time it is due to remain there; this has to be arranged with prior approval.
Other jurisdictions follow a "plate-to-owner" policy, meaning that when a vehicle is sold the seller removes the current plate(s) from the vehicle.
Buyers must either obtain new plates or attach plates they already hold, as well as register their vehicles under the buyer's name and plate number.
A person who sells a car and then purchases a new one can apply to have the old plates put onto the new car.
One who sells a car and does not buy a new one may, depending on the local laws involved, have to turn the old plates in or destroy them, or may be permitted to keep them.
Some jurisdictions permit the registration of the vehicle with "personal" ("vanity" or "cherished mark") plates.
In some jurisdictions, plates require periodic replacement, often associated with a design change of the plate itself.
Vehicle owners may or may not have the option to keep their original plate number, and may have to pay a fee to exercise this option.
Alternately, or additionally, vehicle owners have to replace a small decal on the plate or use a decal on the windshield to indicate the expiration date of the vehicle registration, periodic safety and/or emissions inspections or vehicle taxation.
Other jurisdictions have replaced the decal requirement through the use of computerization: a central database maintains records of which plate numbers are associated with expired registrations, communicating with automated number plate readers to enable law-enforcement to identify expired registrations in the field.
Plates are usually fixed directly to a vehicle or to a plate frame that is fixed to the vehicle.
Sometimes, the plate frames contain advertisements inserted by the vehicle service centre or the dealership from which the vehicle was purchased.
Vehicle owners can also purchase customized frames to replace the original frames.
In some jurisdictions registration plate frames are illegal or have design restrictions.
For example, many states, like Texas, allow plate frames but prohibit plate frames from covering the name of the state, province, district, Native American tribe or country that issued the license plate (when that information appears on the plate).
Plates are designed to conform to standards with regard to being read by eye in day or at night, or by electronic equipment.
Some drivers purchase clear, smoke-colored or tinted covers that go over the registration plate to prevent electronic equipment from scanning the registration plate.
Legality of these covers varies.
Some cameras incorporate filter systems that make such avoidance attempts unworkable, usually with infra-red filters.
Vehicles pulling trailers, such as caravans and semi-trailer trucks, are typically required to display a third registration plate on the rear of the trailer.
An engineering study by the University of Illinois published in 1960 recommended that the state of Illinois adopt a numbering system and plate design "composed of combinations of characters which can be perceived quickly and accurately, are legible at a distance of approximately 125 feet (38 m) under daylight conditions, and are readily adapted to filing and administrative procedures".
It also recommended that a standard plate size of 6 inches (15 cm) by 14 inches (36 cm) be adopted through the United States to replace the earlier 6 inches (15 cm) by 12 inches (30 cm) size to allow longer registration numbers to be displayed without excessively tight spacing or excessively thin or narrow characters.
In order to combat registration plate fraud, from the 1920s several jurisdictions developed their own anti-fraud typefaces so that characters cannot be painted or modified to resemble other characters.
Since the 1990s, many jurisdictions have adopted the FE-Schrift typeface.
France was the first country to introduce the registration plate with the enactment of the Paris Police Ordinance on 14 August 1893, followed by Germany in 1896.
The Netherlands was the first country to introduce a national registration plate, called a "driving permit", in 1898.
Initially these plates were just sequentially numbered, starting at 1, but this was changed in 1906.
In the United States, where each state issues plates, New York State has required plates since 1903 (black numerals on a white background) after first requiring in 1901 only that the owner's initials be clearly visible on the back of the vehicle.
At first, plates were not government-issued in most jurisdictions and motorists were obliged to make their own.
In 1903, Massachusetts was the first state to issue plates.
In 1928, Idaho was the first state to put a logo on the plate (the "Idaho Potato").
In Spain, the first law to define rules on non-animal vehicle traction was Real orden de 1897 de circulación de vehículos cuyo motor no sea la fuerza animal and the registration of vehicles was defined as a provincial task in the Reglamento de 1900 para el servicio de coches automóviles por las carreteras.
The first Spanish registration plate, PM–1, was issued for a Clément-Talbot on 31 October 1900 in Palma de Mallorca.
From 1901 to 1905 256 vehicles were registered.
The earliest plates were made  of enamel on metal or ceramic with no backing, which made them fragile and impractical.
Few of these early plates survived.
Later experimental materials include cardboard, leather, plastic, and, during wartime shortages, copper and pressed soybeans.
As of the 21st century, most plates are made out of aluminium.
Metal plates are manufactured through one of two processes: embossing or riveting.
For embossing, a plate is placed between dies on each side corresponding to the desired characters and compressed by a press.
For riveting, holes are drilled through the plate and then individual letters are riveted one-by-one to the plate.
New technology has allowed for the development of digital license plates.
In 2018, Michigan approved Public Act 656, making electronic license plates legal.

Algerian registration plates are manufactured according to the same standards as their French counterparts (prior to 2009), using the same font and dimensions – although there has been a recent tendency to apply custom typefaces (impact and century gothic have been observed).
Normal vehicles have number plates starting with the letter B, followed by three digits, followed by three letters.
The digits and letters are assigned by a registrar.
The three letters never include the letter Q, to avoid confusion with O. Botswana number plates have a reflective white front and yellow rear background, and black lettering.
Government vehicles all have the prefix "BX", these number plates have a white reflective background with red lettering at the front and white on red at the rear.
After 'BX' are the last two numerals of the date of issue and then up to four digits issued serially.
Botswana Defence Force vehicles have the prefix "BDF" in white on an 'army' green background.
Diplomatic vehicles' number plates start with two numerals which indicate the embassy to which they are attached, then two letters CD (Corps Diplomatique), CC (Consular Corps status) or CT (Foreign Technical and Advisory personnel) and another three digits which are serial.
The official car of the Head of Mission uses the letters CMD rather than CD and the private vehicle uses CDA.
This series is allocated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Botswana is the former British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, and number plates then used a 'BP' prefix (then BPA, BPB, etc.) followed by up to three digits, in white on black background, the plates being made in the characteristic style of South Africa at that time.
Vehicles are fitted with registration plates in the front and rear of the vehicle.
Motorcycles (50cc or more) must be licensed and only bear rear plates.
Registration is performed at the local police or Gendarmerie station.
The first digits of the plate indicate the province in which the vehicle is registered.
Only plates which meet government standards and are sold by licensed dealers may be fitted.
Private passenger car registration plates have a white background with black letters and digits.
Plates exist in a long pattern and a rectangular pattern, similar in size and appearance to French plates.
The plate is adorned with a small flag of Burkina Faso in the shape of the country, inscribed in a black circle.
The letters "BF" appear below the circle, also in black.
This circle and BF design is to the right of the long plate and to the upper right of the rectangular plate.
Motorcycle plates are similar to rectangular automobile plates, but smaller.
Commercial registration plates are similar in appearance to private plates, but the background is blue, and the writing and circle are white.
Security forces plates are black with white letters.
They are adorned with the emblem of the relevant security service.
The current scheme of regular license plates was introduced in 1985.
It has AB1234V formats or AB123VH where AB is the code region, 1234 is the number, and SH is the series.
The regular plate has an orange background with black marks.
Since 2005, to reflect the German FE font used, on the left side of the plate are the emblems of the Economic Community of Central African States code and the CMR emblem.
The current series of vehicle registration plates in Kenya are on a white plate with black lettering and look quite similar to UK suffix style registrations.
The format is LLL 000L, where 'L' denotes a letter and '0' denotes a digit.
The older series of number plates were black with white or silver lettering.
The rear plates in the older series of number plates were yellow and black lettering.
According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics there are over 1,626,380 vehicles on Kenyan roads as at 2011.
New-style (post-1983, black lettering on white) Moroccan vehicle registrations have one or two digits to the right of the plate to indicate the town of registration.
Each number is separated by a vertical line.
To the left of the plate are a series of up to 5 digits issued consecutively.
These are separated from the town of registration digits by a hyphen.
Earlier plates (1972–1983, black lettering on white.
Pre-1972, white lettering on black) differed in that they could have either one or two numbers to indicate the town of registration.
The group of digits was separated from the rest of the plate by a vertical line.
The current plates use numerals without script.
Earlier plates used numerals and included Arabic script.
South African number plates are unique in each of the provinces.
Each province has its own number plate design and colors, as well as numbering scheme.
The history of registration plates in Argentina can be broken down in two major phases: the decentralized phase (until 1972) and the centralized one (since 1972).
During the decentralized phase, registration plates were assigned by each municipality or by the provinces, while during the second phase, the national state took charge of standardizing and centralizing the design and style.
Argentina has used the ABC 123 format since 1995.
However, from 2016, new registration plates with the logo of Mercosur and the AB 123 CD format were implemented.
Both formats coexist temporarily.
Bolivia's current registration plate system consists of four numbers followed by three letters.
At the top of the plate, "BOLIVIA" is spelled out.
At the top left corner, the Bolivian flag may be present, and at the top right corner, a letter denoting the department in which the car is registered, according to the ISO 3166-2:BO code, is displayed on either a metal tab on older plates or a sticker on newer plates.
The current registration plate design consists of a white background with a blue borderline and blue letters and numbers.
Serial digits progress sequentially from right to left, with the 000 AAA format followed by the 1000AAA format and currently the 4000AAA format.
Older plate serials consisted of three numbers followed by three letters (A to Z, except O and Q).
They had a white background with black letters and numbers.
Brazil adopted its former system in 1990, which uses the form ABC•1234, with a dot between the letters and the numbers.
A combination given to a particular vehicle follows it from first issue to the scrapyard: it cannot be transferred to another vehicle.
Above the combination there was a metallic band with the state abbreviation (SP = São Paulo, RJ = Rio de Janeiro, PR = Paraná, AM = Amazonas, etc.)
and the name of the municipality in which the vehicle title owner resides.
During the first registration of a new vehicle, the registering state issues a registration plate to the vehicle rather than owner, and the serial stays with the vehicle for its life.
Brazil, as a member of Mercosur, from September 2018 on, began a new registration system where plates have a blue band at the top with the logo of Mercosur on the left, the country's name centered and country flag on the right.
On the bottom left, there is the international vehicle registration code for Brazil: BR.
The plates are always white: the letter coloring indicates the category (e.g., black on white: private; blue on white: official, police, fire departments, etc.; red on white: taxis, buses, paid freight, etc.).
A new format based on the previous one, ABC1D23, was implemented.
All used cars, when transferred to another owner, must change to the new format keeping their registration, where only its second number (the fifth position of the alphanumeric combination) shall change to a letter, following the pattern: 0
=A, 1=B, 2=C, 3=D, ... 9=J. As of 2020, both formats coexist for the time being.
In Canada, license plates are issued on the provincial or territorial level.
Federally issued plates are only used by the Department of National Defence.
All provinces issue plates in which the letters and numbers are embossed so that they are slightly raised above its surface.
The territory of Nunavut introduced the first flat registration plate in Canada in July 2012.
In the Canadian provinces and territories of Alberta, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon, registration plates are currently only required on the rear of the vehicle.
The remaining provinces – British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario – require the registration plates to be mounted on both the front and rear of the vehicle.
When a person moves from one province to another, they are normally required to obtain new registration plates issued by the new place of residence.
In 1956, all North American passenger vehicle registration plates (except for French-controlled St. Pierre and Miquelon), were standardized at a size of 6 in × 12 in (152 mm × 305 mm), although a smaller size is used for certain vehicle classes, such as motorcycles, and for the state of Delaware's historic alternate black and white plates, which are 5.25 in × 9.5 in (133 mm × 241 mm).
The plates of the Northwest Territories are shaped like a polar bear but bolt to the standard holes.
Nunavut inherited this design on its creation but switched to rectangular plates in 2012.
Canadian Forces vehicles that travel on regular roads display registration plates.
These vehicles have registration plates issued by the Department of National Defence.
Domestic plates were issued by the DND after 1968.
Most Canadian provinces offer personalized or vanity license plates, where one can display their own unique combination of characters.
Prison inmates in Ontario make registration plates.
Private black-on-yellow plates with the ABC·123 format are used in Colombia.
The municipality of issuance is embossed at the bottom of the plate.
Vehicle number plates in Ecuador have only one design, with the word "Ecuador" appearing in uppercase letters centred at the top of the plate and a unique letter-number combination which consists of three letters (except for motorbikes, diplomatic vehicles and vehicles owned by international organisations) followed by three or more numerical digits.
Formats in use are ABC-123 (old format) and ABC-1234 (new format).
The first letter in the letter-number combination indicates the province of issue.
The second letter might be sequential or a "key letter" identifying the type of registration plate; the following letters and numbers are assigned in sequential order to the date the vehicle has been registered.
Greenlandic vehicle registration plates normally have two letters and five digits.
The combination is simply a serial and has no connection with a geographic location, but the digits have a number series based on vehicle type.
Each Mexican state issues registration plates of a different design.
Most states change designs more or less every third year, with each state on its own plate replacement cycle.
Every year Mexicans pay the tenencia or revalidación de placas ("car plates renewal tax").
A set of Mexican plates includes one pair of plates, a windshield sticker, and in a few states a plate sticker.
In 2001 the size of the plate number was reduced to accommodate the addition of the state number, a legend indicating the position of the plate on the vehicle (delantera (front) or trasera (rear)), and additional graphics.
European-sized plates do exist in Mexico, but are not official or legal.
These generally contain the same design as the standard-size plate in use at the time, and bear the standard letter and number sequence.
Mexican plates come in several different classifications: private, private border, public, public border, federal public service, fiscal and customs inspection, Mexico Army, and diplomatic.
The border plates were introduced in 1972 and are available in the Mexico–USA border zone.
This zone is formed by the states of Baja California and Baja California Sur, as well as parts of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas.
While the state of Nuevo León shares a 15 km (9 mi) border with the U.S., it does not have any cities within the border zone.
In Panama, the design of registration plates changes every year and the plates are the standard North American size and shape.
They used to be made by prison inmates but are now produced on demand and on site using a press.
Plates used to have 6 numbers, but since 2013 new plates for new vehicles have 2 letters and 4 numbers.
The 2 letters go before the numbers.
They have a sticker on one of the corners indicating in which month of the year the plate was issued.
On the bottom center of the plate is the year when the plate was issued.
They also have holograms on the right edge of the plate.
On the top center the plate has the word PANAMA.
Government vehicles always begin with GO.
Taxis begin with T and are always yellow.
School buses say COLEGIAL instead of the year the plate was issued.
Motorcycles begin with M. Metro buses begin with MB.
Plates for motorcycles are about half the standard size.
Plates of vehicles belonging to the national assembly are always white and have the logo of the national assembly on the left and two numbers on the right and are always white.
Vehicles of government executives have no registration plate.
Vehicles from Central America can be used freely in Panama without having to change plates but only if the vehicle will not be staying indefinitely in Panama.
Vehicles must be checked every year when changing the plate.
The plate must be changed every year and once the vehicle is checked a sticker must be attached to the back of the vehicle's windshield.
The color of the sticker changes every year.
The first registration plates in North America appeared in 1903 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Soon after, other states followed suit, with virtually every state having adopted a form of registration plates by 1918.
The first registration plates in the United States were made out of leather, rubber, iron, and porcelain, painted on the front in usually two different colors – one for the background and one for the lettering.
This scheme held true for most states until about 1920.
The front of the plate would usually contain the registration number in large digits, and in smaller lettering on one side of the plate, the two- or four-digit year number, and an abbreviated state name.
Each year, citizens were usually required to obtain a new registration plate from the state government, which would have a different color scheme than the previous year, making it easier for police to identify whether citizens were current with their vehicle registration.
Even before 1920, some states had adopted the technique of embossing the metal plates with raised lettering and numbering, without porcelain, and applying paint all over the plate, directly onto the metal.
Minnesota introduced some registration plates during this period with three different years embossed into the plate, so that the plates were valid for three consecutive years (e.g., 1918, 1919, and 1920).
In the United States, registration plates are issued by each state.
The federal government issues plates only for its own vehicle fleet and for vehicles owned by foreign diplomats.
In the United States, many Native American tribal governments issue plates for their members, while some states provide special issues for tribal members.
Within each jurisdiction, there may also be special plates for groups such as firefighters or military veterans, and for state or municipality-owned vehicles.
The appearance of plates is frequently chosen to contain symbols or slogans associated with the issuing jurisdiction.
Some of these are intended to promote the region.
A few make political statements; for example, most plates issued in District of Columbia include the phrase "Taxation Without Representation" to highlight D.C.'s lack of a voting representative in the United States Congress.
More recently, some states have also started to put a web address pertaining to the state (such as Pennsylvania, which posts the address of its tourism site).
In some states (Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, and some versions in Florida), the issuing county is listed at the bottom, while Kansas does so with a letter-coded registration sticker; Utah did so until 2003.
Indiana identifies counties with a two-digit code in the lower right corner of its plates.
Alabama, Idaho, Montana, Ohio, South Dakota, Wyoming, most Nebraska, and some Oklahoma standard issue plates designate the county by unique codes, usually numeric (Idaho uses a one-letter or one-number/one-letter code; Oklahoma uses a one-letter code), either in the plate number or registration sticker.
Some states, such as New Hampshire, New Mexico, and New York, formerly used county-coded or county-labeled plates before switching to standard-progression plates.
Most states use plates onto which the letters and numbers are embossed so that they are slightly raised above its surface.
Characters on Vermont plates are  engraved onto a large, slightly raised portion of the plate.
Seventeen states – Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming – and both the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have moved to entirely digitally printed "flat" registration plates.
Several other states, such as Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, produce a flat registration plate only for certain plates, such as personalized license plates and special interest plates.
Nevada reverted from using flat registration plates to using embossed plates, after using flat plates as a standard issue for a few years.
The numbering system of registration plates also varies among the jurisdictions.
Some states issue a motorist a serial that stays with that person as long as they live in that state, while other states periodically issue new serials and completely rotate out any old ones.
Some states issue registration plates to vehicles rather than owners, and the serial stays with the vehicle for its life.
Several states do not regularly use certain letters – most commonly the letters I, O, and/or Q – in their plates, except on vanity plates, so as not to confuse observers with the numbers one and zero.
When a person moves from one state to another, they are normally required to obtain new registration plates issued by the new place of residence.
Some U.S. states will even require a person to obtain new plates if they accept employment in that state, unless they can show that they return to another state to live on a regular basis.
The most prominent exceptions to this policy are active duty military service members, who legally do not change residence when they move to a new posting.
Federal law specifically allows them to choose to either retain the state vehicle registration of their original residence or change registration to their state of assignment.
In the United States, 21 states – Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia – do not require an official front registration plate.
In Nevada, front plates are optional if the vehicle was not designed for a front plate and the manufacturer did not provide an add-on bracket or other means of displaying the front plate.
In Massachusetts, certain old rear-only plates are grandfathered, but newly issued registrations require both front and rear plates.
Vehicles owned by the United States Postal Service, unlike other federally owned civilian vehicles, do not bear registration plates, but rather a postal service number such as on the Grumman LLV.
In 1956, all North American passenger vehicle registration plates, except for French-controlled St. Pierre and Miquelon, were standardized at a size of 6 in × 12 in (152.40 mm ×
304.80 mm), although a smaller size is used for certain vehicle classes, such as motorcycles, and for the state of Delaware's historic alternate black and white plates, which are 5.25 in × 9.5 in (133.35 mm × 241.30 mm).
However, in 2012 Puerto Rico began issuing optional European-style plates that incorporate the design language of the standard-issue plates in a longer and narrower size typically seen in Europe.
Tactical vehicles of the United States military do not bear registration plates, even if they travel regularly on public streets and highways.
In many U.S. states, registration plates are made by prison inmates.
Because of this, colloquial terms include "license plate factories" for prison and "making license plates" for serving a prison sentence.
Afghan registration plates primarily use Persian script text and numerals.
The current version was introduced in 2004.
Bangladeshi registration plates use Bengali alphabets and Bengali numerals.
In Bangladesh, the Road Transport Authority (BRTA) issues vehicle registration plates for motor vehicles.
The vehicle registration plates in Bangladesh use Bengali alphabets and Bengali numerals.
The current version of Vehicle registration plates started in 1973.
The International vehicle registration code for Bangladesh is BD.
The general format of vehicle registration plates in Bangladesh is "City – Vehicle Class alphabet and No – Vehicle No".
For example, : "DHAKA-D-11-9999".
The "DHAKA" field represents the city name in Bengali alphabets, the "D" field represents the vehicle class in Bengali alphabets, the "11" field represents the vehicle registration serial in Bengali numerals (newer registrations have a higher serial number) and finally, the "9999" field represents the vehicle number of the vehicle in Bengali numerals.
The plates are installed in both the front and rear of the vehicle, with the rear plate permanently attached to the vehicle.
The plate is only removed when the vehicle has reached the end of service and has been sold for scrap.
New vehicles are not delivered to the purchaser until the plates have been attached at the dealership.
The People's Republic of China issues vehicles registration plates at its Vehicle Management Offices, under the administration of the Ministry of Public Security.
The current plates are of the 2007 standard (GA36-2007), blue background and consist a one-character provincial abbreviation, a letter of the Latin alphabet corresponding to a certain city in the province, and five numbers or letters of the alphabet (e.g. 京A-12345, for a vehicle in Beijing or 粤B-12345 for a vehicle from Shenzhen in Guangdong province).
The numbers are produced at random, and are computer-generated at the issuing office.
(A previous registration plate system, with a green background and the full name of the province in Chinese characters, actually had a sequential numbering order, and the numbering system was eventually beset with corruption).
Yellow plates are issued to motorcycles and large vehicles, such as coaches and buses.
Black plates are issued to vehicles belonging to diplomatic missions and foreigners (including Hong Kong and Macau).
Vehicles registered in Hong Kong or Macau and permitted to enter China would be required to have a separate black plate from China as Hong Kong and Macau operate their own vehicles registration system.
The Chinese plates for these cars followed the pattern of the provincial character for Guangdong (粤), the Latin letter "Z", 4 letters and/or numbers, ending in the abbreviated character for the territory (e.g. 港 for Hong Kong and 澳 for Macau).
For motorcycles, the front plate only included five numbers and rear contained the full information (e.g. for a motorcycle registered in Shanghai as 沪C•12345, the front plate would be "12345" and the rear plate bears the entire set).
Hong Kong number plates follow the British system of colouring, with front white and rear yellow plates.
The numbering system is two letters and (up to) four digits, e.g. AB1234.
Registration plate numbers starting with "AM" are reserved for government use.
The front white and rear yellow background is a reflective material to comply with the BS AU145a standard.
In addition, Hong Kong started a new scheme in 2006 to allow personalised registration plates, with up to eight selectable letters or numbers.
Macau local registration plates follow the Portuguese pre-1992 system of colour and sequence.
Plates have a black background with white numbers.
Numbering system starts from M, and then one letter, and then 4 numbers, and separated by "-", e.g. MA-12-34.
Earlier numbers will only have M instead of MA or MB or MC, etc.
In the Republic of China (Taiwan), vehicle registration plates are issued by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.
The registration numbers contain Latin letters (A to Z), Arabic numerals (0 to 9) and dash (–), and plates also bear Chinese characters.
Vehicle registration plates, usually known as number plates, are issued by the Regional Transport Office of each district.
Most motor vehicles which are used on public roads are required by law to display them.
A two letter identification for the state in which the vehicle is registered.
A two number code to identify the Regional Transport Office (RTO) where the vehicle is registered.
A four digit serial.
For Example,  in the case of "MH 10 EL 5311", "MH" stands for Maharashtra, "10" stands for Sangli city RTO, and "EL 5311" denotes the series and serial number.
The Delhi NCR however uses a modified system wherein an additional alphabet is inserted after the RTO code to classify vehicle type.
For example, a Delhi registration plate may read "DL 12 C AB 0496" where "DL" stands for Delhi, "12 C" stands for Car, and "AB 0496" is the series and number.
In this scheme, 'C' denotes Car, 'S' denotes Scooter/Motorcycle, 'R' stands for rickshaw (three-wheeler), 'F' stands for "Fancy" or VIP numbers irrespective of vehicle type; and "P" for Public transport vehicles.
Some states have been adapting the dual letter series code system, for example car series' are CA, CB, CC; motorbike series' are MA, MB and so on.
Most states however still use the standard series code, denoted by a single letter of the alphabet.
Indonesian vehicle plates share the legacy of the Dutch colonial era, which do not reflect the regional divisions of the country into provinces, but the old system of karesidenan or residencies.
Their prefixes are therefore based on this system.
There are four types of plates that are used in Indonesia, all consisting of a combination of alphabet and numbers.
For commercial and public vehicles, a yellow background with black typeface.
For private vehicles, a white background with black typeface (from June 2022).
Before that, a black background with white typeface.
For government vehicles, a red background with white typeface.
Dealer plates are white background with red typeface, usually for vehicles yet to have legal and confirmed information and owner.
Besides these normal plates, there are also military plates for Army, Navy, Air Force, and also the Police.
While diplomatic corps get special white plates and black numbering with "CD" prefix.
The normal scheme comprises a one or two letters identification for the regencies, followed by an up to four digit numbers for the car's identification, and the last one to three letters are the serial code or district identification.
The expiry date of the license is embossed along the bottom and some on the top of the plate.
At the middle of the plate number, the numbers are usually random or requested by the vehicle owner and has a maximum of four digits and a maximum of three letters at the end of the vehicle's plate number, for example it could be: (B 1 A), (B 12 AB), (B 123 AB), and (B 1234 ABC).
Sometimes the last maximum three letters at the end of the plate identifies the district region of the registered vehicle by the first letter, for example: (B 1234 WIE) which "W" identifies the vehicle is from the region of Southern South Tangerang city (Kota Tangerang Selatan), Banten province.
Vehicle owners may request their vehicle's last letters plate for their own desire, but would need more affairs by the local police registering it, for example that the owner's name is "Adi" then he would make his vehicle's plate number like so: (B 1234 ADI).
The plates usually have their expiration dates shown below or very few on the top of the serial numbers, indicating its expiry month and year, so if it says (12•26) it means that the plate expires at December 2026, so the owner of the vehicle should pay tax and get a new plate at that time, to which the process is redone every five years.
A new plate design introduced in April 2011 eliminates a white line circling the whole plate and has a thinner typeface until it was replaced in 2022.
Iranian license plates have had European standard dimensions since 2005.
Each province in Iran has multiple unique, two-digit codes that are included at the right end of the license plates in a distinguished square outline, above which the word "ایران" or "Iran" has been written.
A province's license plates will not be issued with a new code unless all possible combinations with the old code have been issued.
In Tehran, the first code to be issued for the province was code 11, and subsequent codes all increased by 11 as well (meaning codes 11, 22, 33, ..., 99 are unique to Tehran.)
Ever since code 99 was fully issued, the new codes for Tehran have started from 10 and subsequently increased by 10 (10, 20, 30, ...).
Private vehicles' plates are black on white with a blue strip on the left.
The code in the square represents the regional codes.
The letter can be dependent on where the car's owner's principal address is located.
For example, while regional code "83" belongs to Fars Province, letter "م" (M) is dedicated to residents of Larestan County, while letter "هـ" (H) is dedicated to Jahrom County residents.
X is the series letter.
Each unique classification of vehicles is assigned a unique letter.
For private vehicles, for example, if numbers start from 11 B 111, the letter B will not change until numbers reach 99 B 999.
Then, plates will go up to 11 C111.
These details are explained further in each section of this article.
NN is the province code.
12 V 345-93, is a vehicle registered in Shiraz.
distinguishable from the last two digits of the plate,"93" representing Fars province.
And the letter "V" representing Shiraz city.
12 Q 345-99,  is a vehicle registered in Tehran.
distinguishable from the last two digits of the plate, "99" representing Tehran City.
Israeli civil registration plates are rectangular with reflecting yellow background and embossed with black registration number.
Under the first dash of the registration number (see below form of registration numbers) there is a stamp of approval of the Standards Institute of Israel.
On the left side of the plate there is a euroband embossed with the Israeli flag and beneath it the letters IL and ישראל (Israel) written in Hebrew and below it إسرائيل (Israel) written in Arabic.
Old plates do not hold this euroband.
In North American standard plates (300 x 150mm), the digits are narrower and the blue rectangle is at the bottom of the plate, as the letters are to the right of the flag.
Japanese vehicle registration plates fall into two classes: Prefectural, used nationwide, and Municipal.
Municipal registration is typically applicable to motor vehicles that will not leave the area, such as light motorcycles.
In the prefectural system, the top line names the office at which the vehicle is registered, and includes a numeric code that indicates the class of vehicle.
The bottom contains one serial letter (typically a kana), and up to four digits.
The classes of registration plate are divided by vehicle type and engine size.
For private vehicles less than 660 cc (40 cu in), registration plates have black text on a yellow background.
Above 660 cc (40 cu in), a white plate with green text is used.
For commercial, non-private vehicles, the colors of the number plate are inverted.
An official seal is applied over one (typically the left) screw, preventing the plate being removed and applied to another car.
Municipal registration plates in Japan may vary in color and design.
Jordan requires its residents to register their motor vehicles and display vehicle registration plates.
North Korean vehicle plates follow the pattern XX-##-###, where "XX" is replaced with two Hangul syllables) spelling the province name.
The most common plates are embossed black-on-white to indicate state ownership; plates indicating KPA use are white-on-black.
Motorcycle plates are black-on-yellow or black-on-orange.
The very few privately owned motor vehicles which exist in North Korea bear black-on-red plates, while diplomatic plates are white-on-blue.
Other types of vehicles (trolleys, emergency vehicles, buses/taxis) are indicated with additional numerical prefixes.
Unusually, North Korea requires that bicycles also have license plates, bicycles do not have license plates in most other countries.
In a 2024 interview with NK News, the Swedish diplomat August Borg noted the bicycle policy during his time working in North Korea and considered it "unreasonable".
In South Korea, 6 types of registration number plates (3 variations of size, both non-commercial and commercial) are issued currently.
Prior to 2006, sizes of plates were 335 by 155 mm (13.2 by 6.1 in) for normal vehicles and 440 by 200 mm (17.3 by 7.9 in) for large vehicles (buses with length over 6 metres (19 feet 8 inches) and trucks with payload over 4 t (3.9 long tons; 4.4 short tons)).
Since November 2006, standard plate size for normal vehicles was changed to 520 by 110 mm (20.5 by 4.3 in), resembling European Union standard.
Nonetheless, older 335 mm (13.2 in) plates are still effective for older vehicles and some models not fit for new standard, which are mostly imported cars.
One example is the Ford Mustang.
Even cars with 520 mm (20.5 in) plate in front and 335 mm (13.2 in) plate in rear are not rare.
Non-commercial vehicles (nationwide registration number "00-X-0000": X is one Hangeul character denoting type of vehicle) bear plates with white background and black letters, while commercial vehicles (Region name is added as prefix like "Seoul 12 GA 3456") with yellow background and black letters.
In older system, non-commercial vehicles plates had green background and white letters.
There are a few exceptions, including diplomats and United States military.
Lebanese vehicle registration plates generally have a blue bar to the left like in European Union countries (except without the 12 golden stars) if the plate is European standard.
The blue bar is to the top if the plate is North American standard.
The blue bar consists of the name of Lebanon in Arabic (لبنان), the Lebanese Cedar tree in the middle, and the vehicle's classification all in white.
The rest of the plate is white, with a Latin letter representing the vehicle's registration area and Arabic numbers next to the letter in bold.
Different colors represent different usages (e.g., red ones are used by taxis and public transport, green ones are for rental vehicles, etc.).
Malaysian registration plates are displayed at the front and rear of all private and commercial motorised vehicles in Malaysia, as required by law.
The issuing of the registration plates is regulated and administered by the Malaysian Road Transport Department (Malay: Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan Malaysia) or JPJ.
Nepal embossed plate was started from 2017.
In Nepal, all road vehicles with or without a motor (except bicycles) are tagged with a registration number.
Registration plates are commonly known as number plates.
The registration plate number is issued by the zonal-level Transport Management Office, a government agency under the Department of Transport Management.
The registration plates must be placed in the front as well as back of the vehicle.
The president of Nepal travels in an official vehicle that has no number on its plates.
Instead it has the coat of arms of Nepal embossed on it.
LL is a "counter" comprising two letters, which increments after the sequence number reaches 9999.
NNNN is a sequence number from 0001 to 9999.
These plates come with a RFID microchip that enables the government to maintain uniformity in issuance of number plates and prevent duplication.
Similarly, the new number plates also help authorities to maintain digital records of vehicles plying on the roads, collect revenue on time and control auto theft.
Eight types of registration plates are used in Pakistan.
Each province and territory issues its own number plate; the federal government issues number plates for foreign diplomats and vehicles owned by the military, police and federal departments (red for foreign diplomats and green for the federal government.)
Sindh's number plates are yellow with black letters and numbers for private vehicles and Black number plates with white letters for commercial vehicles; Islamabad, NWFP, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Balochistan and Northern Areas have white number plates with black letters and numbers.
The number plates also have the province or territory's name at the bottom.
In Punjab however, number plates can be of any color the vehicle owner chooses.
But legally it is not allowed.
The first 2 letters represent the city the vehicle is registered in.
From January 1, 2006, Punjab has started issuing official number plates for all cars registered in Punjab.
Number plates are of Green and White color.
The green part is the same all over Punjab and has a sign and 'Punjab' written on it, while the white part has the number of the vehicle.
RIZ 3725, is a vehicle registered in Rawalpindi, Punjab.
MN 3909, is a vehicle registered in Multan, Punjab.
All number plates use the Latin alphabet.
Saudi Arabian vehicle plates display both Arabic and Latin characters.
In general, every motor vehicle in Singapore has a vehicle registration number.
Two colour schemes are in use: white-on-black scheme that is standard on cars from dealerships, or the Euro black-on-white (front of the vehicle) and black-on-yellow (rear) scheme, of which the number plate has to be made of a reflective plastic or metallic with textured characters which are black (for white-yellow), or white or silver (for black ones).
No standardised typeface is used, though all typefaces are based on the Charles Wright number plate typeface used in the UK.
Thinner-looking variants are commonly used by SBS Transit buses, taxis and goods vehicles.
Rarely, the FE-Schrift font used in Germany can be seen – though the use of this font is prohibited by the Land Transport Authority (LTA).
Vehicle registration plates of Sri Lanka (known in Sri Lanka as "number plates") started soon after introduction of motorcars in 1903.
Initially the numbers started with Q, and the oldest existing plate is "Q 53" of a 1903 Wolsley.
Later the island was divided into sections from "A " to "Z" (Ex A 123 ), then after World War II it changed to the two Roman letter plates combining pairs of letters in the word CEYLON .
These series were CL XXXX, EY XXXX, EL XXXx .
Afterwards in 1956 a new system with the Sinhala script letter Sri (ශ්‍රී) in the middle was introduced, this started from Reg no "1 Sri 1".
The current series of car registrations in Sri Lanka was introduced in 2000 and is on yellow number plates with black characters and a black border.
On the left hand side of the number plate is the country emblem, below which is a two-letter region identifier e.g. WP represents the Western Province.
The format of the remainder of the registration is LL – DDDD, with L being a letter and D being a number.
The previous series of registrations had been in effect since 1956 and was on brighter yellow plates with the format DD – DDDD.
Also they did not have any national emblem or region identifier.
Taxis have white number plates with red lettering.
The current Vietnamese registration plate design consists of a white background with black characters, each province has a regional number (located on the left side of the plate).
Official and government cars bear blue registration plates, central government plates bear the number 80 followed by the letter A, B or M, diplomatique plates are white with NG wrote in red, company members vehicles are also white registration plate bearing LD letters in black.
Military registration plates are red with white letter.
For example, 51X-XXXX would be used for civilian vehicles, 80X-XXXX with blue background for central government vehicles, 80-XXX-NG-XX for diplomatic vehicles, TC-XX-XX for military vehicles and XXLD-XXX.XX for company vehicles.
In the European Union (EU), white or yellow number plates of a common format and size are issued throughout, although they are still optional in some member states.
Nevertheless, some individual member states still use differing non-EU formats – Belgium, for example, still permits vehicles to display the older small white number plates with red lettering, and the registration plates that are issued by the government body which assigns these are of the smaller format, too.
In 1908 number plates were only three digits and one letter long.
Italy still permits smaller plates to be attached to the front of a vehicle, while the rear plate complies to the usual EU format.
The common design consists of a blue strip on the left of the plate, which has the EU motif (12 yellow stars), along with the country code of the member state in which the vehicle was registered.
Lettering on the plate must be black on a white or yellow reflective background.
Most plates in Europe bar few exceptions are white, with a notable exception being the Netherlands which issues yellow (the UK also has yellow but only for rear plates, formerly also in France).
According to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, vehicles in cross-border traffic are obliged to display the international vehicle registration code as a distinguishing sign of the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle.
This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate.
With registration plates in the common EU format, vehicles registered in the EU are no longer required to carry an international code plate or sticker for traveling within the European Economic Area.
The common EU format is also recognized in countries signatory to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.
As are registration plates of other European countries similar to the EU format, such as Norwegian ones; with the Norwegian flag replacing the circle of stars, or in Turkey's case where the blue stripe with the country code is standard but omits the flag over it.
Both the common EU format, and e.g. Norwegian registration plates satisfy the requirements laid out in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic; According to the convention, when the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs.
Diplomatic plates are usually denoted by the letters "CD" in Europe which stands for Corps Diplomatique located usually at the beginning of the number plate (France, Belgium, Italy) or middle (Netherlands, Portugal).
The United Kingdom uses "D" for "diplomat".
In order to combat registration plate fraud, Germany developed a typeface which is called fälschungserschwerende Schrift (abbr.
: FE-Schrift), meaning "falsification-hindering script".
It is designed so that, for example, the O cannot be adjusted to look like a Q, or vice versa; nor can the P be painted to resemble an R, amongst other changes.
This typeface can more easily be read by radar or visual registration plate reading machines, but can be harder to read with the naked eye, especially when the maximum allowed number of eight characters in "Engschrift" (narrower script used when available space is limited) are printed on the plate.
Many countries have since adopted FE-Schrift, or developed their own anti-fraud typeface.
Denmark offers both a European and a domestic style registration plate.
They have a fairly similar look, with the EU strip with the letters DK.
Both styles are in the XX 12 345 format.
The first two letters run sequentially with no ties to any geographic region.
The first two digits designate the type of vehicle.
For example, 10 through 18 are reserved for motorcycles.
EU registration plates were introduced in Finland in 2001.
EU plates are automatically given to all vehicles unless the owner makes a separate request for old model plates.
If desired, EU plates can be changed for old model ones at inspection sites.
Registration plates used in Finland are made of aluminium with a reflective membrane coating.
Numbers and letters are embossed and painted.
The embossing height is 1–1.2 mm.
The number sequence of the registration plate cannot start with a zero, nor can zero be the only number.
The letter combination CD is reserved for diplomatic vehicles.
Usually the next available ID is given as the plate number.
Special registration plates with a selected ID are also available upon request.
A special registration plate is a regular plate with a special ID.
The ID is subject to certain restrictions and requires a separate application subject to a fee.
The application fee for a special registration plate is EUR 900.
A vehicle has one or two plates depending on the vehicle class.
In certain cases, a vehicle can also be given an additional plate.
The registration numbers of cars in Norway are maintained by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.
As in most countries, cars are identified only by number plates read visually.
The current alphanumerical system (two letters followed by five digits) was introduced in 1971.
The design of the plates remained the same until 2002, when the road authorities decided on a new font which standardized the width of each character.
The new design was unsuccessful due to legibility issues, for example the letters "A" and "R" were often hard to distinguish.
From 2006 the font was changed again to improve legibility, and space was provided for a blue nationality stripe with a Norwegian flag.
From 2009, plates were made of plastic, and produced in a factory at Tønsberg.
From 2012, plates are again produced in aluminium.
Also, electric cars have access to plates that begin with either "EL", "EK", "EV", "EB", "EC", "ED", "EE", "EF", or "EH".
Motorcycle/moped/agriculture vehicle plate - color scheme identical to standard plates, the only differences are two rows instead of one and using only 4 characters after location code.
Format: XY(Z) ####.
Classic car plates - black text on yellow background and a picture of a vintage car on the right.
Format: XY ### or XYZ ##.
Temporary/export plates - red text on white background, format: X0 #### where 0 stands for a digit.
Electric car plates - identical to standard plates with the only difference being light green background instead of white.
Competition car plates - the newest type of registration plates, introduced in 1 June 2024, yellow background and red text, formats are the same as in standard plates.
Service car plates - plates issued to different kinds of services.
(mainly Police and Border Guard, also Central Bureau of Anticorruption, Government Protection Bureau, Internal Security Agency, Foreign Intelligence Agency, Military Counterintelligence Agency and Military Intelligence Agency, in the past also Customs Service and Fiscal Control) Format: H@% #### where @ stands for a letter representing service and % stands for a letter representing certain region.
Military plates - plates issued for military vehicles, color scheme same as standard plates, format: U@ 00000 or U@ 0000T where @ stands for a type of a vehicle.
Diplomatic plates - white text on blue background.
Poland is one of the few countries not using CD to indicate a diplomatic plate.
Format: X 000000 where the first three digits indicate country, and the last three - function of the vehicle.
Current Russian registration plates are a mix of French FNI, traditional Arabic "windows", and Soviet "small characters", introduced in 1993.
There are six types of Russian registration plates.
Civil plates – white background with black characters.
The character format is "@###@@ | RR", where @ is a letter, using only the Cyrillic letters А, В, Е, К, М, Н, О, Р, С, Т, У, Х (those that resemble Latin letters), # is a digit and RR is a region number (two or three digits).
Government plates – white background with black characters.
The character format is "@###@@ | FL" where FL is the tricolor flag of Russia (canceled in 2007).
Police plates – blue background with white characters, format "@#### | RR".
Diplomatic plates – red background with white characters, format "###@### | RR".
Military plates – black background with white characters, format "####@@ | RR".
Route vehicles (buses, trolleys and fixed-run taxies) – yellow background with black characters, format "@@### | RR".
Vehicle registration plates are white with black characters.
The plates have three letters, a space, two digits and lastly one digit or letter.
The combination is simply a serial and has no connection with a geographic location.
Vehicles like police cars, fire trucks, public buses and trolley buses use the same type of plate as normal private cars, and cannot be directly distinguished by the plate alone.
It is possible, for a fee, to get a personal plate with one to seven digits.
Taxis have yellow plates, with the same combination of letters and digits as 'normal' cars.
The diplomatic corps have blue plates.
The two first letters indicate the country or organization of the user.
Military vehicles have four to six yellow digits on black background, and may be used for all kinds of vehicles from ordinary automobiles to tanks.
Turkish car number plates use an indirect numbering system associated with geographical info.
In Turkey, registration plates are made by authorized private workshops.
The registration plate is rectangular in shape and made of aluminum.
On the left, there is the country code "TR" in a 4×10 cm blue stripe like in EU countries (without the 12 golden stars).
The text is in black characters on white background, and for official vehicles white on black.
On all vehicles, two plates have to be present, one in front and the other in the rear except for motorcycles and tractors.
The serial letters use the letters common to the Turkish and English alphabets, avoiding the Turkish letters Ç, Ğ, İ, Ö, Ş, Ü, and the English letters Q, W, X. Ukrainian regular registration plates are issued in European style, using the format AB1234CE (the prefix refers to the region), using Cyrillic letters that resemble Roman letters (А, В, Е, І, К, М, Н, О, Р, С, Т, Х).
The plates have, at the far left, the Ukrainian flag and UA (country code) in a 4×10 cm blue stripe like in EU countries (without the 12 golden stars).
There were single-line plates for vehicles and trailers, double-line plates for vehicles with special shaped mounting place, three-lined plates for cycles (except scooters with small two-line plates).
A plate with a yellow background is used for public-use vehicles such as taxis or route buses.
Single-line plates are the standard European size 52 cm × 11 cm (20.5 by 4.3 inches).
Ukrainian vanity plates are unique in that purchasers may choose any image to be printed on the surface of the plate, to the right of the characters.
Vehicle registration plates, usually known as number plates, have existed in the United Kingdom since 1904.
Most motor vehicles that are used on public roads are required by law to display them.
The Motor Car Act 1903, which came into force on 1 January 1904, required all motor vehicles to be entered on an official vehicle register, and to carry number plates.
The Act was passed in order that vehicles could be easily traced in the event of an accident or contravention of the law.
Vehicle registration number plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law.
Most plates are white at the front of the vehicle and yellow at the back, with black lettering, with the exception of classic vehicles, which bear black plates at both front and rear with silver text.
Within the UK itself there are currently two numbering and registration systems: one for the island of Great Britain, which is administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), and one for Northern Ireland, administered by the Driver & Vehicle Agency (DVA): both have equal status.
It is optional to show a national identifier on British number plates.
Number plates including the "GB" code are valid in countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic if displayed on its own or together with the Union Jack.
From 28 September 2021, the UK changed its mark from GB to UK, both in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
In Australia, vehicle registration plates, usually known as number plates or 'rego plates', are normally issued by the State or Territory government; until 2000 some were issued by the Commonwealth government.
Plates are associated with a vehicle and generally last for its life, though as they become unreadable (or for other reasons)
they may be recalled or replaced with newer ones.
New plates are issued when the vehicle is registered in another state, or if the owner requests them (though this depends on state laws).
Australian number plates were originally issued with white characters on black plates, black on white, black on yellow and blue on white, with each state and territory being allocated a range of plates inside the larger range AAA000 to ZZZ999.
New South Wales, for example, was allocated AAA000 to FZZ999, Victoria was allocated from GAA000 to MZZ999, Queensland was allocated NAA000 to QZZ999 and South Australia was allocated from RAA000 to TZZ999.
Western Australia was allocated UAA000 and XAA000, Tasmania and the Australia Capital Territory were allocated the series beginning with W and Y respectively.
This system worked for a few decades but had been almost completely abandoned by 1980, particularly because some states had exhausted their allocated range of combinations.
The Northern Territory never adopted the system.
The states then chose their own systems.
New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia all retained xxx-nnn, but each started again from AAA-000.
Queensland reversed the arrangement to nnn-xxx.
Western Australia took nxx-nnn, and the ACT kept the Y plate range but substituted the last digit for a letter, giving Yxx-nnx.
In 2013, Victoria became the last state to abandon the xxx-nnn format.
Current arrangements are listed below.
All current plates are manufactured to uniform dimensions and are made of pressed aluminium, except for certain special series plates; the form of which differs by state and design.
In 1942, the government released a new special series only alphabet (XB-AA OPS).
Blue text on white background, with "ACT" above and "CANBERRA – THE NATION'S CAPITAL" below.
Code format: YAB-12C. Black text on yellow background, with "NEW SOUTH WALES" below the plate code.
Also in circulation are plates showing "NEW SOUTH WALES – THE FIRST STATE" and "NEW SOUTH WALES – THE PREMIER STATE" with code xxx-nnn, from the 1980s.
Code format: AB-12-CD.
Blue on white background, with "VIC – THE EDUCATION STATE" under the plate code.
Older plates show, "VIC – STAY ALERT STAY ALIVE", "VICTORIA – THE PLACE TO BE", "VICTORIA – ON THE MOVE", or "VICTORIA – THE GARDEN STATE" in green on white.
Code format: 1AB-2CD.
Maroon text (previously green) on white background, with "QUEENSLAND – SUNSHINE STATE" or "QUEENSLAND – THE SMART STATE" under the plate code.
Code format: 123-AB4.
Black on white with "SOUTH AUSTRALIA" under code.
Code format: S123-ABC.
Blue on white with WESTERN AUSTRALIA on blue band at top of plate.
Older plates black on yellow with format nxx-nnn.
Code format: 1ABC-234.
Even older Western Australian plates use a locality code, followed by a sequential number, e.g. AL 123 being for Albany, plate number 123.
Some rural locations added a central dot to signify if the plate was issued for shire- or town-based drivers.
This locality based system is still active, although it needs to be offered or asked for at the time of licensing the vehicle.
Blue on white with "TASMANIA – Explore The Possibilities" at bottom and a thylacine between the first letter and two digits.
Older plates may show "TASMANIA – HOLIDAY ISLE" or "TASMANIA – YOUR NATURAL STATE".
Code format: A-12-BC.
Orange text on white background with "NT – OUTBACK AUSTRALIA" over code.
Code format: CA-12-BC.
To show that a vehicle is registered in Australia, a sticker must be displayed in the lower left corner of either the rear left window or windscreen in annual colors on a six-year cycle: blue, red, purple, brown, green and orange.
This sticker is issued to the registered owner of the vehicle upon payment of the next year's registration fee, and shows the expiry date of the registration.
They are color-coded for easy recognition of the year of expiry.
The sticker shows the plate number, vehicle identification number, make, model, and color of the vehicle, along with other such information.
This acts as an anti-theft device, because transplanting the plates from one car to another will be in contrast to the details on the sticker.
The Western Australia registration sticker shows only the month and year of expiry.
However, since the Western Australian police now have such easy access to registration information based on the number plate via in-car computer systems found in all police vehicles, registration stickers in Western Australia have been completely scrapped.
As of 1 January 2010 they will no longer be required or made – a move that is said to save at least $2 million over 4 years in costs for printing and postage.
Car owners will also feel the relief of not having to perform the tedious task of removing and re-applying the registration sticker every 6–12 months.
As of 1 January 2013 NSW have also scrapped registration stickers.
NT also scrapped registration stickers as of 1 January 2014.
Tasmania scrapped registration stickers as of 1 January 2014.
In the Australian Capital Territory, vehicles under 4.5 tonnes are no longer required to display registration labels as of 1 July 2013.
In Queensland, when all of the 123-ABC combinations had been taken, the plates have the combination 123-AB4.
When they run out of combinations for that series the number will move to the left.
Cars owned by the government have special number plates, some also have a crown and symbols.
The current system used in New Zealand was adopted in 1964, all vehicles were required to have their plates replaced to this system.
The original format in this system was xx-nnnn with the original plate being AA1 plates were on a black background with silver text.
In 1986 this was changed to a white reflective background with black text with the first plate in this style being NA1.
In 2001 the final plate ZZ9999 was printed and the format was changed to ABC-123.
In 2006 the text format was changed on all number plates registered after this time.
Personalized number plates were introduced to New Zealand in 1987.
Due to the smaller size and population of New Zealand, the same system is used across all of the country.
Number plates are usually issued by the New Zealand Transport Agency.
There are no private cars in Antarctica, and therefore there is no vehicle registration authority.
There are other vehicles such as tractors and AWDs; however, they are not required to display registration plates.
Many countries allow licensed amateur radio operators to obtain registration plates (labeled "Amateur Radio") with their call signs printed on them, allowing public service officials controlling access to disaster areas to immediately recognize and allow operators into the areas, facilitating their provision of crucial emergency communications.
Some U.S. states charge lower fees for ham radio plates than for vanity plates.
For example, in Virginia the annual cost of an amateur radio vanity plate is a mere $1.
In the U.S., most provinces of Canada, and Australia, vehicle owners may also pay extra for specialty plates: with these, the sequence of letters and digits is chosen by the licensing agency – as with regular plates – but the owners select a plate design that is different from the normal registration plate.
Fees for specialty plates are usually channeled to a specific charity or organization.
For example, California has issued the "Yosemite plate" and "whale tail plate," both aimed at conservation efforts in the respective domains.
Some jurisdictions allow for these special plates to also be vanity plates, usually for an additional fee on top of the cost of the plate.
In some Australian states, it is possible to purchase "personalized plates", where an individual can choose the color, design, and sometimes even the shape and size of the plate, as well as the displayed text.
For example, the government of the state of Queensland offers a wide range of possibilities for customization, including some emoji.
Another style of plate that is common in some states of Australia is "Euro Plates", which are the same size as European plates (rather than the narrower taller Australian plates) to fit on the number plate holders in European cars.
The world record for the most expensive registration plate is US$14 million.
The registration plate "1" was bought at an auction in Abu Dhabi.
Some registration plate combinations are banned  from being issued by registration authorities.
These are typically combinations which, deliberately or otherwise, spell out a message that is likely to offend others.
Concerns about what is considered offensive differ from country to country.
In the United Kingdom, these have included combinations with sexual connotations such as BO11 LUX and BL04 JOB.
The DVLA maintains block lists of possible combinations of letters and digits in an attempt to prevent this.
Some prohibited plates reflect religious concerns; for example, in New Jersey, a woman found she was prohibited from registering the plate 8THEIST, but permitted to register BAPTIST.
A similar registration for ATHE1ST had been rejected in 2013.
Both prohibitions were later lifted.
In Manitoba, a plate reading ASIMIL8 was banned as being culturally offensive to indigenous people.
In 2015, Maine passed legislation that removed most censorship from their vanity plate program.
Plates like GETFUKT are now allowed.
In some states of Germany license plates that could be mistaken for Nazi codes (with a definition further than Strafgesetzbuch section 86a) are prohibited and in some cases even license plates that had existed for decades were not grandfathered in but had to be changed as stricter regulations were applied.
The letter combinations KZ, HJ, SS and SA are not issued for license plates anywhere in Germany due to their Nazi associations.
Some jurisdictions issue temporary registration plates made of cardboard or security paper or even printed on plain paper for newly purchased vehicles, for drivers waiting for plates in the mail, or other registration issues.
A common length of time to have temporary plates is 30 days, although Ontario offers ten-day permits, and some U.S. states allow temporary tags to be effective for up to 90 days.
Temporary registration plates are usually either attached to the vehicle in place of the rear registration plate or both registration plates or taped to the inside of the rear windshield, while some states require it to be in the front windshield.
Expiration dates are usually hand written by regulatory employees or dealership sales personnel, but, due to easy alteration of hand written dates, some states now digitally print the date on the tag.
If a driver continues to drive after the permit expires the vehicle can face impounding as an unplated vehicle.
There also exist novelty registration plates often sold in gift or novelty shops.
Similar to vanity plates, these novelties are printed with an individual's name or other words or phrases, but unlike vanity plates they are not intended for legal identification of an automobile.
They can be displayed in the rear window, for example, or on the front of vehicles registered in jurisdictions that only require a valid plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Novelty registration plates are usually installed by motorists or automobile dealerships.
While automobile dealerships may install such plates for promoting their business, motorists may install novelty registration plates to express their brand preference or an affiliation with a group, state, country, athletic team, hobby, art, or custom.
Antique auto collectors may use novelty replicas of period registration plates to give their show cars a dated look, or import vehicle owners may use a novelty replica of a foreign plate to give it a foreign image.
Some states allow year of manufacture registrations where an original, official plate expiring on the model year of an antique car is revalidated.
Wisconsin, for instance, permits the use of year-of-manufacture plates if the state-issued plates are also carried somewhere within the vehicle.
California and Ohio also allow the Year-of-manufacture Plates.
Today, plates are commonly attached with screws that mount into threaded fittings on the vehicle but originally nut-and-bolt combinations were needed to fasten the plate to a bracket, which led to the use of varied registration plate ornaments, accessories and attachments.
The most common of these include fastening bolts with ornamental heads in a myriad of styles; these are generally legal everywhere providing the plate itself is not obscured.
Those bolts faced with a colored glass or plastic reflector are termed registration plate jewels.
Traditionally the front plate would be fastened by an amber or green jewel and the rear by a red jewel, but other colors have become available over the decades including blue, clear and, most recently, purple.
The manufacture and use of registration plate toppers – attachments and accessories mounted atop plates, often as advertising premiums – has diminished because of the design of modern vehicle bodies that incorporate recessed plate mountings.
But older vehicles will usually have room for such attachments that may mention vehicle dealerships, tourist attractions and petroleum companies.
Some of these commercial toppers also incorporate one or more reflectors or a safety-related message.
Large stand-alone glass or plastic reflectors or cataphotes – some imprinted with an advertising message – are still common plate toppers whenever registration-plate brackets are able to accommodate them.
According to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, vehicles in cross-border traffic are obliged to display a distinguishing sign of the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle.
This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate.
When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs.
The distinguishing sign should be displayed on the far left or far right on the registration plate.
When a symbol/flag/emblem is also displayed, the distinguishing sign shall obligatory be placed on the far left on the plate.
The distinguishing sign shall be positioned so to be easy identifiable and so that it cannot be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility.
The distinguishing sign shall therefore be at least a different color from the registration number, or have a different background color to that reserved for the registration number, or be clearly separated from the registration number, preferably with a line.
The physical requirements for the separate sign are defined in Annex 3 of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which states that the letters shall be in black on a white background having the shape of an ellipse with the major axis horizontal.
The distinguishing sign should not be affixed in such a way that it could be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility.
The allocation of codes is maintained by the United Nations (UN) as the Distinguishing Signs of Vehicles in International Traffic, being authorized by the UN's Geneva Convention on Road Traffic (1949) and Vienna Convention on Road Traffic (1968).
Many, but far from all, vehicle codes created since the adoption of ISO 3166 coincide with either the ISO two- or three-letter codes.
In Canada, Mexico and the United States, where the international oval is not used on vehicles from neighboring countries, putting one on a car is a matter of personal choice.
This has given rise to a tourist-driven industry of imitation international code stickers.
For example, the island of Martha's Vineyard off the coast of Massachusetts has MV, while the Outer Banks region of North Carolina uses OBX.
Long Beach Island, New Jersey uses "LBI", with the letter "I" substituted with an illustration of the island's lighthouse.
The city of Key West, Florida, uses KW as part of its Conch Republic 'rebellion' from the U.S. There are also YNP ovals, for Yellowstone/Yosemite National Park.
Stickers of this sort are usually visibly different from any real international code sticker, but some places sell what could appear to be real stickers, touting that the abbreviation refers to their venue.
In the United Kingdom, imitation international codes are sometimes seen for the various parts of the country.
For example, in Scotland, oval stickers with Écosse or Alba (Scotland in French and Gaelic respectively) are occasionally seen.
In Wales, drivers commonly display "CYM" to indicate Cymru (Wales).
In Spain, there are such codes for regionalist movements, such as CAT for Catalonia or AST for Asturias, which can be often seen in their reflective region.
For many years councils in Australia have debated whether registration should also be required for bicycle riders.
In 2014, Randwick councilor Charles Matthews proposed to impose a $50 registration fee on bicycle riders, which would be used to help fund cycleways being built by the council.
This proposal was rejected by other councillors.
In 2014 the Victorian council of City of Bayside tried a similar proposal.
A window deflector is mounted above the doors of some automobiles, to protect the inside of the car from rain or other precipitation in case of slightly opened windows.
Deflectors may also be fitted to sunroofs to change the flow of air.
This type of deflectors is installed into the upper window channel, and is kept in place due to tension.
In some applications, this type of deflector also employs a thin stripe of automotive-grade 3M tape to keep the deflector in place.
This installation type requires an adhesive tape (i.e. 3M) at the back of the deflectors to mount them securely.
This adhesive film allows mounting a deflector above the window (either to the window frames, or to the roof if the windows are frameless).
A hood protector or bug guard is a similar look product which is supposed to protect the car paint against insects.
Rear window louvers or rear window blinds (German Heckjalousie or Heckscheibenjalousie) is a type of window blind which can be mounted to the rear window of a car.
It is supposed to make the window get less dirty as well as hinder bothersome sunlight from entering through the rear window, but has been criticized by at least one car expert as a fashion phenomena with little practical use.
In 1966, Lamborghini Miura became one of the first production cars that came with rear window louvers.
The Wankel engine (/ˈvaŋkəl̩/, VUN-kell) is a type of internal combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion.
The concept was proven by German engineer Felix Wankel, followed by a commercially feasible engine designed by German engineer Hanns-Dieter Paschke.
The Wankel engine's rotor, which creates the turning motion, is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle, with the sides having less curvature.
The rotor spins inside a figure-eight-like epitrochoidal housing around a fixed-toothed gearing.
The midpoint of the rotor moves in a circle around the output shaft, rotating the shaft via a cam.
In its basic gasoline fuelled form, the Wankel engine has lower thermal efficiency and higher exhaust emissions when compared to the four-stroke reciprocating piston engine.
The thermal inefficiency has restricted the engine to limited use since its introduction in the 1960s.
However, many disadvantages have mainly been overcome over the succeeding decades as the production of road-going vehicles  progressed.
The advantages of compact design, smoothness, lower weight, and fewer parts over the reciprocating piston internal combustion engines make the Wankel engine suited for applications such as chainsaws, auxiliary power units, loitering munitions, aircraft, jet skis, snowmobiles, and range extenders in cars.
The Wankel engine was also used to power motorcycles and racing cars.
The Wankel engine is a type of rotary piston engine and exists in two primary forms, the Drehkolbenmotor (DKM, "rotary piston engine"), designed by Felix Wankel (see Figure 2.) and the Kreiskolbenmotor (KKM, "circuitous piston engine"), designed by Hanns-Dieter Paschke (see Figure 3.), of which only the latter has left the prototype stage.
Thus, all production Wankel engines are of the KKM type.
In a DKM engine, there are two rotors: the inner, trochoid-shaped rotor, and the outer rotor, which has an outer circular shape, and an inner figure eight shape.
The center shaft is stationary, and torque is taken off the outer rotor, which is geared to the inner rotor.
In a KKM engine, the outer rotor is part of the stationary housing (thus not a moving part).
The inner shaft is a moving part with an eccentric lobe for the inner rotor to spin around.
The rotor spins around its center and around the axis of the eccentric shaft in a hula hoop fashion, resulting in the rotor making one complete revolution for every three revolutions of the eccentric shaft.
In the KKM engine, torque is taken off the eccentric shaft, making it a much simpler design to be adopted to conventional powertrains.
Felix Wankel designed a rotary compressor in the 1920s, and received his first patent for a rotary type of engine in 1934.
He realized that the triangular rotor of the rotary compressor could have intake and exhaust ports added producing an internal combustion engine.
Eventually, in 1951, Wankel began working at German firm NSU Motorenwerke to design a rotary compressor as a supercharger for NSU's motorcycle engines.
Wankel conceived the design of a triangular rotor in the compressor.
With the assistance of Prof. Othmar Baier from Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences, the concept was defined mathematically.
The supercharger he designed was used for one of NSU's 50 cm3 one-cylinder two-stroke engines.
The engine produced a power output of 13.5 PS (10 kW) at 12,000 rpm.
In 1954, NSU agreed to develop a rotary internal combustion engine with Felix Wankel, based upon Wankel's supercharger design for their motorcycle engines.
Since Wankel was known as a "difficult colleague", the development work for the DKM was carried out at Wankel's private Lindau design bureau.
According to John B. Hege, Wankel received help from his friend Ernst Höppner, who was a "brilliant engineer".
The first working prototype, DKM 54 (see figure 2.), first ran on 1 February 1957, at the NSU research and development department Versuchsabteilung TX.
It produced 21 PS (15 kW).
Soon after that, a second prototype of the DKM was built.
It had a working chamber volume Vk of 125 cm3 and also produced 21 kW (29 PS) at 17,000 rpm.
It could even reach speeds of up to 25,000 rpm.
However, these engine speeds distorted the outer rotor's shape, thus proving impractical.
According to Mazda Motors engineers and historians, four units of the DKM engine were built; the design is described to have a displacement Vh of 250 cm3 (equivalent to a working chamber volume Vk of 125 cm3).
The fourth unit built is said to have received several design changes, and eventually produced 29 PS (21 kW) at 17,000 rpm; it could reach speeds up to 22,000 rpm.
One of the four engines built has been on static display at the Deutsches Museum Bonn (see figure.
Due to its complicated design with a stationary center shaft, the DKM engine was impractical.
Wolf-Dieter Bensinger explicitly mentions that proper engine cooling cannot be achieved in a DKM engine, and argues that this is the reason why the DKM design had to be abandoned.
NSU development chief engineer Walter Froede solved this problem by using Hanns-Dieter Paschke's design and converting the DKM into what would later be known as the KKM (see figure 5.).
The KKM proved to be a much more practical engine, as it has easily accessible spark plugs, a simpler cooling design, and a conventional power take-off shaft.
Wankel disliked Froede's KKM engine because of its inner rotor's eccentric motion, which was not a pure circular motion, as Wankel had intended.
He remarked that his "race horse" was turned into a "plough horse".
Wankel also complained that more stresses would be placed on the KKM's apex seals due to the eccentric hula-hoop motion of the rotor.
NSU could not afford to finance the development of both the DKM and the KKM, and eventually decided to drop the DKM in favor of the KKM, because the latter seemed to be the more practical design.
Wankel obtained the US patent 2,988,065 on the KKM engine on 13 June 1961.
Throughout the design phase of the KKM, Froede's engineering team had to solve problems such as repeated bearing seizures, the oil flow inside the engine, and the engine cooling.
The first fully functioning KKM engine, the KKM 125, weighing in at only 17 kg (37.5 lb) displaced 125 cm3 and produced 26 PS (19 kW) at 11,000 rpm.
Its first run was on 1 July 1958.
In 1963, NSU produced the first series-production Wankel engine for a car, the KKM 502 (see Figure 6.).
It was used in the NSU Spider sports car, of which about 2,000 were made.
Despite its "teething troubles", the KKM 502 was a powerful engine with decent potential, smooth operation, and low noise emissions at high engine speeds.
It was a single-rotor PP engine with a displacement of 996 cm3 (61 in3), a rated power of 40 kW (54 hp) at 6,000 rpm and a BMEP of 1 MPa (145 lbf/in2).
The Wankel engine has a spinning eccentric power take-off shaft, with a rotary piston riding on eccentrics on the shaft in a hula-hoop fashion.
The Wankel is a 2:3 type of rotary engine, i.e., its housing's inner side resembles a two lobes oval-like epitrochoid (equivalent to a peritrochoid),.
In contrast, its rotary piston has a three vertices trochoid shape (similar to a Reuleaux triangle).
Thus, the Wankel engine's rotor constantly forms three moving working chambers.
The Wankel engine's basic geometry is depicted in figure 7.
Seals at the rotor's apices seal against the housing's periphery.
The rotor moves in its rotating motion guided by gears and the eccentric output shaft, not being guided by the external chamber.
The rotor does not make contact with the external engine housing.
The force of expanded gas pressure on the rotor exerts pressure on the center of the eccentric part of the output shaft.
All practical Wankel engines are four-cycle (i.e., four-stroke) engines.
In theory, two-cycle engines are possible, but they are impractical because the intake gas and the exhaust gas cannot be properly separated.
The operating principle is similar to the Otto operating principle; the Diesel operating principle with its compression ignition cannot be used in a practical Wankel engine.
Therefore, Wankel engines typically have a high-voltage spark ignition system.
In a Wankel engine, one side of the triangular rotor completes the four-stage Otto cycle of intake, compression, expansion, and exhaust each revolution of the rotor (equivalent to three shaft revolutions, see Figure 8.).
The shape of the rotor between the fixed apexes is to minimize the volume of the geometric combustion chamber and maximize the compression ratio, respectively.
As the rotor has three sides, this gives three power pulses per revolution of the rotor.
Wankel engines have a much lower degree of irregularity when compared to a reciprocating piston engine, making the Wankel engine run much smoother.
This is because the Wankel engine has a lower moment of inertia and less excess torque area due to its more uniform torque delivery.
For instance, a two-rotor Wankel engine runs more than twice as smoothly as a four-cylinder piston engine.
The eccentric output shaft of a Wankel engine also does not have the stress-related contours of a reciprocating piston engine's crankshaft.
The maximum revolutions of a Wankel engine are thus mainly limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears.
Hardened steel gears are used for extended operation above 7,000 or 8,000 rpm.
In practice, automotive Wankel engines are not operated at much higher output shaft speeds than reciprocating piston engines of similar output power.
Wankel engines in auto racing are operated at speeds up to 10,000 rpm, but so are four-stroke reciprocating piston engines with relatively small displacement per cylinder.
In aircraft, they are used conservatively, up to 6500 or 7500 rpm.
Including the parallel transfers of the rotor and the inner housing provides sufficient accuracy for determining chamber volume.
Different approaches have been used over time to evaluate the total displacement of a Wankel engine in relation to a reciprocating engine: considering only one, two, or all three chambers.
Part of this dispute was because of Europe vehicle taxation being dependent on engine displacement, as reported by Karl Ludvigsen.         .         .         .

.         .
Applying a 2/3 gear set to the output shaft of the three-cylinder (or a 3/2 one to the Wankel), the two are analogous from the thermodynamic and mechanical output point of view, as pointed out by Huber.
Daimler Benz:
All types of engines from 50 PS (37 kW) up to 350 PS (257 kW), from 1961 until 1976.
In 1961, the Soviet research organizations of NATI, NAMI, and VNIImotoprom commenced the development of a Wankel engine.
Eventually, in 1974, development was transferred to a special design bureau at the AvtoVAZ plant.
John B. Hege argues that no license was issued to any Soviet car manufacturer.
Felix Wankel managed to overcome most of the problems that made previous attempts to perfect the rotary engines fail, by developing a configuration with vane seals having a tip radius equal to the amount of "oversize" of the rotor housing form, as compared to the theoretical epitrochoid, to minimize radial apex seal motion plus introducing a cylindrical gas-loaded apex pin which abutted all sealing elements to seal around the three planes at each rotor apex.
In the early days, unique, dedicated production machines had to be built for different housing dimensional arrangements.
However, patented designs such as U.S. patent 3,824,746, G. J. Watt, 1974, for a "Wankel Engine Cylinder Generating Machine", U.S. patent 3,916,738, "Apparatus for machining and/or treatment of trochoidal surfaces" and U.S. patent 3,964,367, "Device for machining trochoidal inner walls", and others, solved the problem.
Wankel engines have a problem not found in reciprocating piston four-stroke engines in that the block housing has intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust occurring at fixed locations around the housing.
This causes a very uneven thermal load on the rotor housing.
In contrast, four-stroke reciprocating engines perform these four strokes in one chamber, so that extremes of "freezing" intake and "flaming" exhaust are averaged and shielded by a boundary layer from overheating working parts.
The University of Florida proposed the use of heat pipes in an air-cooled Wankel to overcome this uneven heating of the block housing.
Pre-heating of certain housing sections with exhaust gas improved performance and fuel economy, also reducing wear and emissions.
The boundary layer shields and the oil film act as thermal insulation, leading to a low temperature of the lubricating film (approximate maximum 200 °C or 390 °F on a water-cooled Wankel engine).
This gives a more constant surface temperature.
The temperature around the spark plug is about the same as in the combustion chamber of a reciprocating engine.
With circumferential or axial flow cooling, the temperature difference remains tolerable.
Problems arose during research in the 1950s and 1960s.
For a while, engineers were faced with what they called "chatter marks" and "devil's scratch" in the inner epitrochoid surface, resulting in chipping of the chrome coating of the trochoidal surfaces.
They discovered that the cause was the apex seals reaching a resonating vibration, and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of the apex seals as well as using more suitable materials.
Scratches disappeared after introducing more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings.
Yamamoto experimentally lightened apex seals with holes.
Now, weight was identified as the main cause.
Mazda then used aluminum-impregnated carbon apex seals in their early production engines.
NSU used carbon antimony-impregnated apex seals against chrome.
NSU developed ELNISIL coating to production maturity and returned to a metal sealing strip for the RO80.
Mazda continued to use chrome, but provided the aluminum housing with a steel jacket, which was then coated with a thin dimensional galvanized chrome layer.
This allowed Mazda to return to the 3mm and later even 2mm thick metal apex seals.
Another early problem was the build-up of cracks in the stator surface near the plug hole, which was eliminated by installing the spark plugs in a separate metal insert/ copper sleeve in the housing instead of a plug being screwed directly into the block housing.
Toyota found that substituting a glow-plug for the leading site spark plug improved low rpm, part load, specific fuel consumption by 7%, and emissions and idle.
A later alternative solution to spark plug boss cooling was provided with a variable coolant velocity scheme for water-cooled rotaries, which has had widespread use, being patented by Curtiss-Wright, with the last-listed for better air-cooled engine spark plug boss cooling.
These approaches did not require a high-conductivity copper insert, but did not preclude its use.
Ford tested a Wankel engine with the plugs placed in the side plates, instead of the usual placement in the housing working surface (CA 1036073 , 1978).
Wankel engines are capable of high-speed operation, meaning they do not necessarily need to produce high torque to produce high power.
The positioning of the intake port and intake port closing greatly affect the engine's torque production.
Early closing of the intake port increases low-end torque, but reduces high-end torque (and thus power).
In contrast, late closing of the intake port reduces low-end torque while increasing torque at high engine speeds, thus resulting in more power at higher engine speeds.
A peripheral intake port gives the highest mean effective pressure; however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, because it helps to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the intake ducts, which cause "misfirings" caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite.
Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range, but PP was also linked to worse idle stability and part-load performance.
Early work by Toyota led to the addition of a fresh air supply to the exhaust port.
It also proved that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a slight loss of power at top rpm.
Elasticity is improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine.
Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system.
Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean effective pressure, more severely in peripheral intake port engines.
The Mazda RX-8
Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs, and there have been studies of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines.
Side intake ports (as used in Mazda's Renesis engine) were first proposed by Hanns-Dieter Paschke in the late 1950s.
Paschke predicted that precisely calculated intake ports and intake manifolds could make a side port engine as powerful as a PP engine.
As previously described, the Wankel engine is affected by unequal thermal expansion due to the four cycles taking place in fixed places of the engine.
While this puts great demands on the materials used, the simplicity of the Wankel makes it easier to use alternative materials, such as exotic alloys and ceramics.
A commonplace method is, for engine housings made of aluminum, to use a spurted molybdenum layer on the engine housing for the combustion chamber area, and a spurted steel layer elsewhere.
Engine housings cast from iron can be induction-brazed to make the material suited for withstanding combustion heat stress.
Among the alloys cited for Wankel housing use are A-132, Inconel 625, and 356 treated to T6 hardness.
Several materials have been used for plating the housing working surface, Nikasil being one.
Citroën, Daimler-Benz, Ford, A P Grazen, and others applied for patents in this field.
For the apex seals, the choice of materials has evolved along with the experience gained, from carbon alloys, to steel, ferritic stainless, Ferro-TiC, and other materials.
The combination of housing plating and the apex and side seal materials was determined experimentally, to obtain the best duration of both seals and housing cover.
For the shaft, steel alloys with little deformation on load are preferred, the use of Maraging steel has been proposed for this.
Leaded petrol fuel was the predominant type available in the first years of the Wankel engine's development.
Lead is a solid lubricant, and leaded petrol is designed to reduce the wearing of seals and housings.
The first engines had the oil supply calculated with consideration of petrol's lubricating qualities.
As leaded petrol was being phased out, Wankel engines needed an increased mix of oil in the petrol to provide lubrication to critical engine parts.
An SAE paper by David Garside extensively described Norton's choices of materials and cooling fins.
Early engine designs had a high incidence of sealing loss, both between the rotor and the housing and also between the various pieces making up the housing.
Also, in earlier model Wankel engines, carbon particles could become trapped between the seal and the casing, jamming the engine and requiring a partial rebuild.
It was common for very early Mazda engines to require rebuilding after 50,000 miles (80,000 km).
Further sealing problems arose from the uneven thermal distribution within the housings causing distortion and loss of sealing and compression.
This thermal distortion also caused uneven wear between the apex seal and the rotor housing, evident on higher mileage engines.
The problem was exacerbated when the engine was stressed before reaching operating temperature.
However, Mazda Wankel engines solved these initial problems.
Current engines have nearly 100 seal-related parts.
The problem of clearance for hot rotor apexes passing between the axially closer side housings in the cooler intake lobe areas was dealt with by using an axial rotor pilot radially inboard of the oils seals, plus improved inertia oil cooling of the rotor interior (C-W US 3261542 , C. Jones, 5/8/63, US 3176915 , M. Bentele, C. Jones.
A.H. Raye.
7/2/62), and slightly "crowned" apex seals (different height in the center and in the extremes of seal).
As is described in the thermodynamic disadvantages section, the early Wankel engines had  poor fuel economy.
This is caused by the Wankel engine's design of combustion chamber shape and huge surface area.
The Wankel engine's design is, on the other hand, much less prone to engine knocking, which allows using low-octane fuels without reducing compression.
NSU tested at the suggestion of Felix Wankel low octane gasoline.
On a trial basis 40-octane gasoline was produced by BV Aral, which was used in the Wankel DKM54 test engine with a compression ratio of 8:1; it ran without complaint.
This upset the petrochemical industry in Europe, which had invested considerable sums of money in new plants for the production of higher quality gasoline.
Direct injection stratified charge engines can be operated with fuels with particularly low octane numbers.
Such as diesel fuel, which only has an octane number of ~25.
As a result of the poor efficiency, a Wankel engine with peripheral exhaust porting has a larger amount of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) released into the exhaust.
The exhaust is, however, relatively low in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, because the combustion is slow, and temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of the Wankel engine's good exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) behavior.
Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of Wankel and Otto engines are about the same.
The Wankel engine has a significantly higher (ΔtK>100 K) exhaust gas temperature than an Otto engine, especially under low and medium load conditions.
This is because of the higher combustion frequency and slower combustion.
Exhaust gas temperatures can exceed 1300 K under high load at engine speeds of 6000 rpm−1.
To improve the exhaust gas behavior of the Wankel engine, a thermal reactor or catalyst converter may be used to reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide from the exhaust.
Mazda uses a dual ignition system with two spark plugs per chamber.
This increases the power output and at the same time reduces HC emissions.
At the same time, HC emissions can be lowered by reducing the pre-ignition of the T leading plug compared to the L trailing plug.
This leads to internal afterburning and reduces HC emissions.
On the other hand, the same ignition timing of L and T leads to a higher energy conversion.
Hydrocarbons adhering to the combustion chamber wall are expelled into the exhaust at the peripheral outlet.
Mazda used 3 spark plugs in their R26B engine per chamber.
The third spark plug ignites the mixture in the trailing side before the squish is generated, causing the mixture to burn completely and, also speeding up flame propagation, which improves fuel consumption.
According to Curtiss-Wright research, the factor that controls the amount of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust is the rotor surface temperature, with higher temperatures resulting in fewer hydrocarbons in the exhaust.
Curtiss-Wright widened the rotor, keeping the rest of engine's architecture unchanged, thus reducing friction losses and increasing displacement and power output.
The limiting factor for this widening was mechanical, especially shaft deflection at high rotative speeds.
Quenching is the dominant source of hydrocarbon at high speeds and leakage at low speeds.
Using side-porting which enables closing the exhaust port around the top-dead center and reducing intake and exhaust overlap helps improving fuel consumption.
Mazda's RX-8 car with the Renesis engine (that was first presented in 1999), met in 2004 the United States' low emissions vehicle (LEV-II) standard.
This was mainly achieved by using side porting: The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotary engines were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the side of the combustion chamber.
This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area.
This design improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range.
The HC emissions from the side exhaust port rotary engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine.
Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular-shaped intake port.
However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations, and it was discontinued in 2012.
The new Mazda 8C of the Mazda MX-30 R-EV meets the Euro 6d-ISC-FCM emissions standard.
Laser ignition was first proposed in 2011, but first studies of laser ignition were only conducted in 2021.
It is assumed that laser ignition of lean fuel mixtures in Wankel engines could improve fuel consumption and exhaust gas behavior.
In a 2021 study, a Wankel model engine was tested with laser ignition and various gaseous and liquid fuels.
Laser ignition leads to a faster center of combustion development, thus improving combustion speed, and leading to a reduction in NOx emissions.
The laser pulse energy required for proper ignition is "reasonable", in the low single-digit mJ-range.
A significant modification of the Wankel engine is not required for laser ignition.
Research has been undertaken into rotary compression ignition engines.
The basic design parameters of the Wankel engine preclude obtaining a compression ratio sufficient for Diesel operation in a practical engine.
The Rolls-Royce and Yanmar compression-ignition approach was to use a two-stage unit (see figure 16.), with one rotor acting as compressor, while combustion takes place in the other.
Both engines were not functional.
A different approach from a compression ignition (Diesel) Wankel engine is a non-CI, multifuel Wankel engine that is capable of operating on a huge variety of fuels: diesel, petrol, kerosene, methanol, natural gas, and hydrogen.
German engineer Dankwart Eiermann designed this engine at Wankel SuperTec (WST) in the early 2000s.
It has a chamber volume of 500 cm3 (cc) and an indicated power output of 50 kW (68 horsepower) per rotor.
Versions with one up to four rotors are possible.
The WST engine has a common-rail direct injection system operating on a stratified charge principle.
Similar to a Diesel engine and unlike a conventional Wankel engine, the WST engine compresses air rather than an air–fuel mixture as in the four-cycle engine compression phase.
Fuel is only injected into the compressed air shortly before top-dead centre, which results in stratified charge (i.e., no homogeneous mixture).
A spark plug is used to initiate combustion.
The pressure at the end of the compression phase and during combustion is lower than in a conventional Diesel engine, and the fuel consumption is equivalent to that of a small indirect injection compression ignition engine (i.e., >250 g/(kW·h)).
Diesel-fuel-powered variants of the WST Wankel engine are being used as APUs in 60 Deutsche Bahn diesel locomotives.
The WST diesel fuel engines can produce up to 400 kW (543 horse power).
As a hydrogen/air fuel mixture is quicker to ignite with a faster burning rate than gasoline, an important issue of hydrogen internal combustion engines is to prevent pre-ignition and backfire.
In a rotary engine, each cycle of the Otto cycle occurs in different chambers.
Importantly, the intake chamber is separated from the combustion chamber, keeping the air/fuel mixture away from localized hot spots.
Wankel engines also do not have hot exhaust valves, which eases adapting them to hydrogen operation.
Another problem concerns the hydrogenate attack on the lubricating film in reciprocating engines.
In a Wankel engine, the problem of a hydrogenate attack is circumvented by using ceramic apex seals.
Easily adapted and highly suitable to use hydrogen fuel.
Wankel engines are considerably lighter and simpler, containing far fewer moving parts than piston engines of equivalent power output.
Valves or complex valve trains are eliminated by using simple ports cut into the walls of the rotor housing.
Since the rotor rides directly on a large bearing on the output shaft, there are no connecting rods and no crankshaft.
The elimination of reciprocating mass gives Wankel engines a low non-uniformity coefficient, meaning that they operate much smoother than comparable reciprocating piston engines.
For instance, a two-rotor Wankel engine is more than twice as smooth in its operation as a four-cylinder reciprocating piston engine.
A four-stroke cylinder produces a power stroke only every other rotation of the crankshaft, with three strokes being pumping losses.
The Wankel engine also has higher volumetric efficiency than a reciprocating piston engine.
Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises, especially at higher engine speeds.
This difference is more pronounced when compared to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts.
Due to the absence of hot exhaust valves, the fuel octane requirements of Wankel engines are lower than in reciprocating piston engines.
As a rule of thumb, it may be assumed that a Wankel engine with a working chamber volume Vk of 500 cm3 and a compression of ε=9 runs well on mediocre-quality petrol with an octane rating of just 91 RON.
If in a reciprocating piston engine, the compression must be reduced by one unit of compression to avoid knock, then, in a comparable Wankel engine, a reduction in compression may not be required.
Because of the lower injector count, fuel injection systems in Wankel engines are cheaper than in reciprocating piston engines.
An injection system that allows stratified charge operation may help reduce rich mixture areas in undesirable parts of the engine, which improves fuel efficiency.
Wankel rotary engines mainly suffer from poor thermodynamics caused by the Wankel engine's design with its huge surface area and poor combustion chamber shape.
As an effect of this, the Wankel engine has slow and incomplete combustion, which results in high fuel consumption and bad exhaust gas behavior.
Wankel engines can reach a typical maximum efficiency of about 30 percent.
In a Wankel rotary engine, fuel combustion is slow, because the combustion chamber is long, thin, and moving.
Flame travel occurs almost exclusively in the direction of rotor movement, adding to the poor quenching of the fuel and air mixture, being the main source of unburnt hydrocarbons at high engine speeds: The trailing side of the combustion chamber naturally produces a "squeeze stream" that prevents the flame from reaching the chamber's trailing edge, which worsens the consequences of the fuel and air mixture quenching poorly.
Direct fuel injection, in which fuel is injected towards the leading edge of the combustion chamber, can minimize the amount of unburnt fuel in the exhaust.
The engine housing has vastly different temperatures in each separate chamber section.
The different expansion coefficients of the materials lead to imperfect sealing.
Additionally, both sides of the apex seals are exposed to fuel, and the design does not allow for controlling the lubrication of the rotors accurately and precisely.
Rotary engines tend to be overlubricated at all engine speeds and loads, and have relatively high oil consumption and other problems resulting from excess oil in the combustion areas of the engine, such as carbon formation and excessive emissions from burning oil.
By comparison, a piston engine has all functions of a cycle in the same chamber giving a more stable temperature for piston rings to act against.
Additionally, only one side of the piston in a (four-stroke) piston engine is exposed to fuel, allowing oil to lubricate the cylinders from the other side.
Piston engine components can also be designed to increase ring sealing and oil control as cylinder pressures and power levels increase.
To overcome the problems in a Wankel engine of differences in temperatures between different regions of housing and side and intermediary plates, and the associated thermal dilatation inequities, a heat pipe has been used to transport heat from the hot to the cold parts of the engine.
The "heat pipes" effectively direct hot exhaust gas to the cooler parts of the engine, resulting in decreases in efficiency and performance.
In small-displacement, charge-cooled rotor, air-cooled housing Wankel engines, that has been shown to reduce the maximum engine temperature from 231 to 129 °C (448 to 264 °F), and the maximum difference between hotter and colder regions of the engine from 159 to 18 °C (286 to 32 °F).
Centrifugal force pushes the apex seal onto the housing surface forming a firm seal.
Gaps can develop between the apex seal and trochoid housing in light-load operation when imbalances in centrifugal force and gas pressure occur.
At low engine-rpm ranges, or under low-load conditions, the gas pressure in the combustion chamber can cause the seal to lift off the surface, resulting in combustion gas leaking into the next chamber.
Mazda developed a solution, changing the shape of the trochoid housing, which meant that the seals remained flush with the housing.
Using the Wankel engine at sustained higher revolutions helps eliminate apex seal lift-off, making it viable in applications such as electricity generation.
In motor vehicles, the engine is suited to series-hybrid applications.
NSU circumvented this problem by adding slots on one side of the apex seals, thus directing the gas pressure into the base of the apex.
This effectively prevented the apex seals from lifting off.
Although in two dimensions the seal system of a Wankel looks to be even simpler than that of a corresponding multi-cylinder piston engine, in three dimensions the opposite is true.
As well as the rotor apex seals evident in the conceptual diagram, the rotor must also seal against the chamber ends.
Piston rings in reciprocating engines are not perfect seals; each has a gap to allow for expansion.
The sealing at the apexes of the Wankel rotor is less critical because leakage is between adjacent chambers on adjacent strokes of the cycle, rather than to the mainshaft case.
Although sealing has improved over the years, the less-than-effective sealing of the Wankel, which is mostly due to lack of lubrication, remains a factor reducing its efficiency.
The trailing side of the rotary engine's combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream that pushes back the flame front.
With the conventional one or two-spark-plug system and homogenous mixture, this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber's trailing side in the mid and high-engine speed ranges.
Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent US 3848574 ; Toyota obtained a 7% economy improvement by placing a glow-plug in the leading side, and using Reed-Valves in intake ducts.
In two-stroke engines, metal reeds last about 15,000 km (9,300 miles) while carbon fiber, around 8,000 km (5,000 miles).
This poor combustion in the trailing side of the chamber is one of the reasons why there is more carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons in a Wankel's exhaust stream.
A side-port exhaust, as is used in the Mazda Renesis, avoids port overlap, one of the causes of this, because the unburned mixture cannot escape.
The Mazda 26B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark-plug ignition system and obtained a complete conversion of the aspirated mixture.
In the 26B, the upper late trailing spark plug ignites before the onset of the squeeze flow.
National agencies that tax automobiles according to displacement and regulatory bodies in automobile racing use a variety of equivalency factors to compare Wankel engines to four-stroke piston engines.
Greece, for instance, taxed cars based on the working chamber volume (the face of one rotor), multiplied by the number of rotors, lowering the cost of ownership.
Japan did the same, but applied an equivalency factor of 1.5, making Mazda's 13B engine fit just under the 2-liter tax limit.
FIA used an equivalency factor of 1.8 but later increased it to 2.0, using the displacement formula described by Bensinger.
However, the DMSB applies an equivalency factor of 1.5 in motorsport.
The first rotary-engined car for sale was the 1964 NSU Rotary Spider.
Rotary engines were continuously fitted in cars until 2012 when Mazda discontinued the RX-8.
Mazda introduced a rotary-engined hybrid electric car, the MX-30 R-EV in 2023.
Mazda and NSU signed a study contract to develop the Wankel engine in 1961 and competed to bring the first Wankel-powered automobile to the market.
Although Mazda produced an experimental rotary that year, NSU was the first with a rotary automobile for sale, the sporty NSU Spider in 1964; Mazda countered with a display of two- and four-rotor rotary engines at that year's Tokyo Motor Show.
In 1967, NSU began production of a rotary-engined luxury car, the Ro 80.
NSU had not produced reliable apex seals on the rotor, though, unlike Mazda and Curtiss-Wright.
NSU had problems with apex seals' wear, poor shaft lubrication, and poor fuel economy, leading to frequent engine failures, not solved until 1972, which led to large warranty costs curtailing further NSU rotary engine development.
This premature release of the new rotary engine gave a poor reputation for all makes, and even when these issues were solved in the last engines produced by NSU in the second half of the '70s, sales did not recover.
By early 1978, Audi engineers Richard van Basshuysen and Gottlieb Wilmers had designed a new generation of the Audi NSU Wankel engine, the KKM 871.
It was a two-rotor unit with a chamber volume Vk of 746.6 cm3, derived from an eccentricity of 17 mm, a generating radius of 118.5 mm, and equidistance of 4 mm and a housing width of 69 mm.
It had double side intake ports, and a peripheral exhaust port; it was fitted with a continuously injecting Bosch K-Jetronic multipoint manifold injection system.
According to the DIN 70020 standard, it produced 121 kW at 6500 rpm, and could provide a max. torque of 210 N·m at 3500 rpm.
Van Basshuysen and Wilmers designed the engine with either a thermal reactor, or a catalytic converter for emissions control.
The engine had a mass of 142 kg, and a BSFC of approximately 315 g/(kW·h) at 3000 rpm and a BMEP of 900 kPa.
For testing, two KKM 871 engines were installed in Audi 100 Type 43 test cars, one with a five-speed manual gearbox, and one with a three-speed automatic gearbox.
Mazda claimed to have solved the apex seal problem, operating test engines at high speed for 300 hours without failure.
After years of development, Mazda's first rotary engine car was the 1967 Cosmo 110S.
The company followed with several Wankel ("rotary" in the company's terminology) vehicles, including a bus and a pickup truck.
Customers often cited the cars' smoothness of operation.
However, Mazda chose a method to comply with hydrocarbon emission standards which, while less expensive to produce, increased fuel consumption.
Mazda later abandoned the rotary in most of their automotive designs, continuing to use the engine in their sports car range only.
The company normally used two-rotor designs.
A more advanced twin-turbo three-rotor engine was fitted in the 1990 Eunos Cosmo sports car.
In 2003, Mazda introduced the Renesis engine fitted in the RX-8.
The Renesis engine relocated the ports for exhaust from the periphery of the rotary housing to the sides, allowing for larger overall ports, and better airflow.
The Renesis is capable of 238 hp (177 kW) with improved fuel economy, reliability, and lower emissions than previous Mazda rotary engines, all from a nominal 2.6 L displacement, but this was not enough to meet more stringent emissions standards.
Mazda ended production of their rotary engine in 2012 after the engine failed to meet the more stringent Euro 5 emission standards, leaving no automotive company selling a rotary-powered road vehicle until 2023.
Mazda launched the MX-30 R-EV hybrid fitted with a Wankel engine range extender in March 2023.
The Wankel engine has no direct connection to the wheels and serves only to charge the battery.
It is a single-rotor unit with a 830 cm3 (50.6 in3) engine and a rated power output of 55 kW (74 hp).
The engine has petrol direct injection, exhaust gas recirculation, and an exhaust-gas treatment system with a Three-way catalyst and a particulate filter.
The engine is Euro 6d-ISC-FCM-compliant.
Citroën did much research, producing the M35 and GS Birotor cars, and the RE-2 helicopter, using engines produced by Comotor, a joint venture by Citroën and NSU.
Daimler-Benz fitted a Wankel engine in their C111 concept car.
The C 111-II's engine was naturally aspirated, fitted with petrol direct injection, and had four rotors.
The total displacement was 4.8 L (290 cubic inches), and the compression ration was 9.3:1 It provided a maximum torque of 433 N⋅m (44 kp⋅m) at 5,000 rpm and a produced a power output of 257 kW (350 PS) at 6,000 rpm.
American Motors Corporation (AMC) was so convinced "... that the rotary engine will play an important role as a powerplant for cars and trucks of the future ...", that the chairman, Roy D. Chapin Jr., signed an agreement in February 1973 after a year's negotiations, to build rotary engines for both passenger cars and military vehicles, and the right to sell any rotary engines it produced to other companies.
AMC's president, William Luneburg, did not expect dramatic development through to 1980, but Gerald C. Meyers, AMC's vice president of the engineering product group, suggested that AMC should buy the engines from Curtiss-Wright before developing its own rotary engines, and predicted a total transition to rotary power by 1984.
Plans called for the engine to be used in the AMC Pacer, but development was pushed back.
American Motors designed the unique Pacer around the engine.
By 1974, AMC had decided to purchase the General Motors (GM) rotary instead of building an engine in-house.
Both GM and AMC confirmed the relationship would be beneficial in marketing the new engine, with AMC claiming that the GM rotary achieved good fuel economy.
GM's engines had not reached production when the Pacer was launched onto the market.
The 1973 oil crisis played a part in frustrating the use of the rotary engine.
Rising fuel prices and speculation about proposed US emission standards legislation also increased concerns.
At its annual meeting in May 1973, General Motors unveiled the Wankel engine it planned to use in the Chevrolet Vega.
By 1974, GM R&D had not succeeded in producing a Wankel engine meeting both the emission requirements and good fuel economy, leading to a decision by the company to cancel the project.
Because of that decision, the R&D team only partly released the results of its most recent research, which claimed to have solved the fuel-economy problem and built reliable engines with a lifespan above 530,000 miles (850,000 km).
Those findings were not taken into account when the cancellation order was issued.
The ending of GM's rotary project required AMC, who was to purchase the engine, to reconfigure the Pacer to house its AMC straight-6 engine driving the rear wheels.
In 1974, the Soviet Union created a special engine-design bureau, which, in 1978, designed an engine designated as VAZ-311 fitted into a VAZ-2101 car.
In 1980, the company commenced delivery of the VAZ-411 twin-rotor Wankel engine in VAZ-2106 cars, with about 200 being manufactured.
Most of the production went to the security services.
Ford conducted research in rotary engines, resulting in patents granted: GB 1460229 , 1974, a method for fabricating housings; US 3833321  1974, side plates coating; US 3890069 , 1975, housing coating; CA 1030743 , 1978:
Housings alignment; CA 1045553 , 1979, reed-valve assembly.
In 1972, Henry Ford II stated that the rotary probably would not replace the piston in "my lifetime".
The Sigma MC74 powered by a Mazda 12A engine was the first engine and only team from outside Western Europe or the United States to finish the entire 24 hours of the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, in 1974.
Yojiro Terada was the driver of the MC74.
Mazda was the first team from outside Western Europe or the United States to win Le Mans outright.
It was also the only non-piston engined car to win Le Mans, which the company accomplished in 1991 with their four-rotor 787B (5.24 L or 320 cu in displacement), rated by FIA formula at 4.708 L or 287 cu in).
In the C2 class, all participants had the same amount of fuel.
The only exception was the unregulated C1 Category 1.
This category only allowed naturally aspirated engines.
The Mazdas were classified as naturally aspirated to start with 830 kg weight, 170 kg less than the supercharged competitors.
The cars under the Group C1 Category 1 regulations for 1991 were allowed to be another 80 kg lighter than the 787B.
In addition, Group C1 Category 1 had only permitted 3.5-liter naturally aspirated engines and had no fuel quantity limits.
Due to the compact size and the high power-to-weight ratio of a Wankel engine, it has been proposed for electric vehicles as range extenders to provide supplementary power when electric battery levels are low.
A Wankel engine used as a generator has packaging, noise, vibration, and harshness advantages when used in a passenger car, maximizing interior passenger and luggage space, as well as providing a good noise and vibration emissions profile.
However, it is questionable whether or not the inherent disadvantages of the Wankel engine allow the usage of the Wankel engine as a range extender for passenger cars.
In 2010, Audi unveiled a prototype series-hybrid electric car, the A1 e-tron.
It incorporated a Wankel engine with a chamber volume Vk of 254 cm3, capable of producing 18 kW at 5000 rpm.
It was mated to an electric generator, which recharged the car's batteries as needed and provided electricity directly to the electric driving motor.
The package had a mass of 70 kg and could produce 15 kW of electric power.
In November 2013, Mazda announced to the motoring press a series-hybrid prototype car, the Mazda2 EV, using a Wankel engine as a range extender.
The generator engine, located under the rear luggage floor, is a tiny, almost inaudible, single-rotor 330-cc unit, generating 30 hp (22 kW) at 4,500 rpm and maintaining a continuous electric output of 20 kW. Mazda introduced the MX-30 R-EV fitted with a Wankel engine range extender in March 2023.
The car's Wankel engine is a naturally aspirated single-rotor unit with a chamber volume Vk of 830 cm3 (50.6 in3), a compression of 11.9, and a rated power output of 55 kW (74 hp).
It has petrol direct injection, exhaust gas recirculation, and an exhaust-gas treatment system with a TWC and a particulate filter.
According to auto motor und sport, the engine is Euro 6d-ISC-FCM-compliant.
The first Wankel-engined motorcycle was an MZ-built MZ ES 250, fitted with a water-cooled KKM 175 W Wankel engine.
An air-cooled version followed this in 1965, called the KKM 175 L.
The engine produced 24 bhp (18 kW) at 6,750 rpm, but the motorcycle never went into series production.
In Britain, Norton Motorcycles developed a Wankel rotary engine for motorcycles, based on the Sachs air-cooled rotor Wankel that powered the DKW/Hercules W-2000 motorcycle.
This two-rotor engine was included in the Commander and F1.
Norton improved on Sachs's air cooling, introducing a plenum chamber.
Suzuki also made a production motorcycle powered by a Wankel engine, the RE-5, using ferroTiC alloy apex seals and an NSU rotor in a successful attempt to prolong the engine's life.
In the early 1980s, using earlier work at BSA, Norton produced the air-cooled twin-rotor Classic, followed by the liquid-cooled Commander and the Interpol2 (a police version).
Subsequent Norton Wankel bikes included the Norton F1, F1 Sports, RC588, Norton RCW588, and NRS588.
Norton proposed a new 588-cc twin-rotor model called the "NRV588" and a 700-cc version called the "NRV700".
A former mechanic at Norton, Brian Crighton, started developing his own rotary engined motorcycles line named "Roton", which won several Australian races.
Despite successes in racing, no motorcycles powered by Wankel engines have been produced for sale to the general public for road use since 1992.
In 1972, Yamaha introduced the RZ201 at the Tokyo Motor Show, a prototype with a Wankel engine, weighing 220 kg and producing 60 hp (45 kW) from a twin-rotor 660-cc engine (US patent N3964448).
In 1972, Kawasaki presented its two-rotor Kawasaki X99 rotary engine prototype (US patents N 3848574 &3991722).
Both Yamaha and Kawasaki claimed to have solved the problems of poor fuel economy, high exhaust emissions, and poor engine longevity in early Wankels, but neither prototype reached production.
In 1974, Hercules produced W-2000 Wankel motorcycles, but low production numbers meant the project was unprofitable, and production ceased in 1977.
From 1975 to 1976, Suzuki produced its RE5 single-rotor Wankel motorcycle.
It was a complex design, with both liquid cooling and oil cooling, and multiple lubrication and carburetor systems.
It worked well and was smooth, but it did not sell well because it was heavy and had a modest power output of 62 hp (46 kW).
Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water-cooling system.
The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings, and silencers with heat shields.
Suzuki had three lube systems, while Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system that fed both the main bearings and the intake manifolds.
Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, but with rough patches at 4,000 rpm.
Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame.
Although it was described to handle well, the result was that the Suzuki was heavy, overcomplicated, expensive to manufacture, and, at 62 bhp, short on power.
Dutch motorcycle importer and manufacturer Van Veen produced small quantities of a dual-rotor Wankel-engined OCR-1000 motorcycle between 1978 and 1980, using surplus Comotor engines.
The OCR 1000 engine used a modified KKM 624 engine initially intended for the Citroën GS Birotor car.
Whereby an electronic map ignition from Hartig replaced the ignition distributor.
Having no reciprocating parts, there is less vulnerability to damage when the engine revolves at a higher rate than the designed maximum.
Unlike cars and motorcycles, a rotary aero-engine will be sufficiently warm before full power is asked of it because of the time taken for pre-flight checks.
Also, the journey to the runway has minimum cooling, which further permits the engine to reach the operating temperature for full power on take-off.
A Wankel aero-engine spends most of its operational time at high power outputs, with little idling.
Since rotary engines operate at a relatively high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the rotor spins only at about one-third of that speed.
With relatively low torque, propeller-driven aircraft must use a propeller speed reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range.
Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units; for example, the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox.
The first rotary engine aircraft was in the late-1960s in the experimental Lockheed Q-Star civilian version of the United States Army's reconnaissance QT-2, essentially a powered Schweizer sailplane.
The plane was powered by a 185 hp (138 kW) Curtiss-Wright RC2-60 Wankel rotary engine.
The same engine model was also used in a Cessna Cardinal and a helicopter, as well as other airplanes.
The French company Citroën developed a rotary-powered RE-2 helicopter in the 1970s.
In Germany in the mid-1970s, a pusher ducted fan airplane powered by a modified NSU multi-rotor rotary engine was developed in both civilian and military versions, Fanliner and Fantrainer.
At roughly the same time as the first experiments with full-scale aircraft powered with rotary engines, model aircraft-sized versions were pioneered by a combination of the well-known Japanese O.S. Engines firm and the then-extant German Graupner aeromodelling products firm, under license from NSU.
The Graupner model Wankel engine has a chamber volume Vk of 4.9 cm3, and produces 460 W at 16,000 rpm−1; its mass is 370 g.
It was produced by O.S. engines of Japan.
The sailplane manufacturer Schleicher uses an Austro Engines AE50R Wankel in its self-launching models ASK-21 Mi, ASH-26E, ASH-25 M/Mi, ASH-30 Mi, ASH-31 Mi, ASW-22 BLE, and ASG-32 Mi.
In 2013, e-Go airplanes, based in Cambridge, United Kingdom, announced that a rotary engine from Rotron Power will power its new single-seater canard aircraft.
The DA36 E-Star, an aircraft designed by Siemens, Diamond Aircraft and EADS, employs a series hybrid powertrain with the propeller being turned by a Siemens 70 kW (94 hp) electric motor.
The aim is to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 25%.
An onboard 40 hp (30 kW) Austro Engines rotary engine and generator provide the electricity.
A propeller speed reduction unit is eliminated.
The electric motor uses electricity stored in batteries, with the generator engine off, to take off and climb reducing sound emissions.
The series-hybrid powertrain using the Wankel engine reduces the plane's weight by 100 kg compared with its predecessor.
The DA36 E-Star first flew in June 2013, making this the first-ever flight of a series-hybrid powertrain.
Diamond Aircraft claims that rotary engine technology is scalable to a 100-seat aircraft.
Since 2015, a total of 60 trains in Germany have been equipped with Wankel-engined auxiliary power systems that burn diesel fuel.
The locomotives use the WST KKM 351 Wankel diesel fuel engine.
The Wankel engine is well-suited for devices in which a human operator is close to the engine, e.g., hand-held devices such as chainsaws.
The excellent starting behavior and low mass make the Wankel engine also a good powerplant for portable fire pumps and portable power generators.
Small Wankel engines are being found in applications such as go-karts, personal watercraft, and auxiliary power units for aircraft.
Kawasaki patented mixture-cooled rotary engine (US patent 3991722).
Japanese diesel engine manufacturer Yanmar and Dolmar-Sachs of Germany had a rotary-engined chain saw (SAE paper 760642) and outboard boat engines, and the French Outils Wolf, made a lawnmower (Rotondor) powered by a Wankel rotary engine.
The rotor was in a horizontal position to save on production costs, and there were no seals on the downside.
The simplicity of the rotary engine makes it well-suited for mini, micro, and micro-mini engine designs.
The Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
Rotary Engine Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, has previously undertaken research towards the development of rotary engines of down to 1 mm in diameter, with displacements less than 0.1 cc.
Materials include silicon, and motive power includes compressed air.
The goal of such research was to eventually develop an internal combustion engine with the ability to deliver 100 milliwatts of electrical power, with the engine itself serving as the rotor of the generator, with magnets built into the engine rotor itself.
Development of the miniature rotary engine stopped at UC Berkeley at the end of the DARPA contract.
In 1976, Road & Track reported that Ingersoll-Rand would develop a Wankel engine with a chamber volume Vk of 1,500 in3 (25 dm3) with a rated power of 500 hp (373 kW) per rotor.
Eventually, 13 units of the proposed engine were built, albeit with a larger displacement, and covered over 90,000 operating hours combined.
The engine was made with a chamber volume Vk of 2,500 in3 (41 dm3), and a power output of 550 hp (410 kW) per rotor.
Both single, and twin-rotor engines were made (producing 550 hp (410 kW) or 1,100 hp (820 kW) respectively).
The engines ran on natural gas and had a relatively low engine speed due to its application.
Deere & Company acquired the Curtiss-Wright rotary division in February 1984, making large multi-fuel prototypes, some with an 11-liter rotor for large vehicles.
The developers attempted to use a stratified charge concept.
The technology was transferred to RPI in 1991.
Yanmar of Japan produced small, charge-cooled rotary engines for chainsaws and outboard engines.
One of its products is the LDR (rotor recess in the leading edge of the combustion chamber) engine, which has better exhaust emissions profiles, and reed-valve controlled intake ports, which improve part-load and low rpm performance.
In 1971 and 1972, Arctic Cat produced snowmobiles powered by Sachs KM 914 303-cc and KC-24 294-cc Wankel engines made in Germany.
In the early 1970s, Outboard Marine Corporation sold snowmobiles under the Johnson and other brands, which were powered by 35 or 45 hp (26 or 34 kW) OMC engines.
Aixro of Germany produces and sells a go-kart engine with a 294-cc-chamber charge-cooled rotor and liquid-cooled housings.
Other makers include Wankel AG, Cubewano, Rotron, and Precision Technology.
In addition to applications as an internal combustion engine, the basic Wankel design has also been used for gas compressors, and superchargers for internal combustion engines, but in these cases, although the design still offers advantages in reliability, the primary advantages of the Wankel in size and weight over the four-stroke internal combustion engine are irrelevant.
In a design using a Wankel supercharger on a Wankel engine, the supercharger is twice the size of the engine.
The Wankel design is used in the seat belt pre-tensioner system in some Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars.
When the deceleration sensors detect a potential crash, small explosive cartridges are triggered electrically, and the resulting pressurized gas feeds into tiny Wankel engines, which rotate to take up the slack in the seat belt systems, anchoring the driver and passengers firmly in the seat before a collision.
A wheel is a rotating component (typically circular in shape) that is intended to turn on an axle bearing.
The wheel is one of the key components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines.
Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines.
Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel, and flywheel.
Common examples can be found in transport applications.
A wheel reduces friction by facilitating motion by rolling together with the use of axles.
In order for wheels to rotate, a moment needs to be applied to the wheel about its axis, either by way of gravity or by the application of another external force or torque.
Using the wheel, Sumerians later invented a device that spins clay as a potter shapes it into the desired object.
The English word wheel comes from the Old English word hwēol, from Proto-Germanic *hwehwlaz, from Proto-Indo-European *kwékwlos, an extended form of the root *kwel- 'to revolve, move around'.
Cognates within Indo-European include Icelandic hjól 'wheel, tyre', Greek κύκλος kúklos, and Sanskrit chakra, the last two both meaning 'circle' or 'wheel'.
Mesopotamian civilization was originally credited with the invention of the wheel by several, mainly old sources.
However, recent sources either suggest that it was invented independently in both Mesopotamia and Eastern Europe or credit prehistoric Eastern Europeans with the invention of the wheel.
The earliest evidence of the wheel has been found in Europe.
The invention of the solid wooden disk wheel falls into the late Neolithic, and may be seen in conjunction with other technological advances that gave rise to the early Bronze Age.
This implies the passage of several wheelless millennia even after the invention of agriculture and of pottery, during the Aceramic Neolithic.
The Halaf culture of 6500–5100 BCE is sometimes credited with the earliest depiction of a wheeled vehicle, but this is doubtful as there is no evidence of Halafians using either wheeled vehicles or even pottery wheels.
Potter's wheels are thought to have been used in the 4th millennium BCE in the Middle East.
The oldest surviving example so far found of a potter's wheel was found in Ur (modern day Iraq), and dates to approximately 3100 BCE.
However, a potter's wheel in a workshop in Varvarovka in Moldova has been dated to around 4000 BCE, which further precedes the earliest use of the potter's wheel in Mesopotamia.
Wheels of uncertain dates have also been found in the Indus Valley civilization, a 4th millennium BCE civilization covering areas of present-day India and Pakistan.
The oldest indirect evidence of wheeled movement was found in the form of miniature clay wheels north of the Black Sea before 4000 BCE.
From the middle of the 4th millennium BCE onward, the evidence is condensed throughout Europe in the form of toy cars, depictions, or ruts, with the oldest find in Northern Germany dating back to around 3400 BCE.
In Mesopotamia, depictions of wheeled wagons found on clay tablet pictographs at the Eanna district of Uruk, in the Sumerian civilization are dated to c. 3500–3350 BCE.
In the second half of the 4th millennium BCE, evidence of wheeled vehicles appeared near-simultaneously in the Northern (Maykop culture) and South Caucasus and Eastern Europe (Cucuteni-Trypillian culture).
Depictions of a wheeled vehicle appeared between 3631 and 3380 BCE in the Bronocice clay pot excavated in a Funnelbeaker culture settlement in southern Poland.
In nearby Olszanica, a 2.2 m wide door was constructed for wagon entry; this barn was 40 m long with three doors, dated to 5000 BCE, and belonged to the neolithic Linear Pottery culture.
Surviving evidence of a wheel-axle combination, from Stare Gmajne near Ljubljana in Slovenia (Ljubljana Marshes Wooden Wheel), is dated within two standard deviations to 3340–3030 BCE, the axle to 3360–3045 BCE.
Two types of early Neolithic European wheel and axle are known: a circumalpine type of wagon construction (the wheel and axle rotate together, as in Ljubljana Marshes Wheel), and that of the Baden culture in Hungary (axle does not rotate).
They both are dated to c. 3200–3000 BCE.
Some historians believe that there was a diffusion of the wheeled vehicle from the Near East to Europe around the mid-4th millennium BCE.
Early wheels were simple wooden disks with a hole for the axle.
Some of the earliest wheels were made from horizontal slices of tree trunks.
Because of the uneven structure of wood, a wheel made from a horizontal slice of a tree trunk will tend to be inferior to one made from rounded pieces of longitudinal boards.
The spoked wheel was invented more recently and allowed the construction of lighter and swifter vehicles.
The earliest known examples of wooden spoked wheels are in the context of the Sintashta culture, dating to c. 2000 BCE (Krivoye Lake).
Soon after this, horse cultures of the Caucasus region used horse-drawn spoked-wheel war chariots for the greater part of three centuries.
They moved deep into the Greek peninsula where they joined with the existing Mediterranean peoples to give rise, eventually, to classical Greece after the breaking of Minoan dominance and consolidations led by pre-classical Sparta and Athens.
Celtic chariots introduced an iron rim around the wheel in the 1st millennium BCE.
In China, wheel tracks dating to around 2200 BCE have been found at Pingliangtai, a site of the Longshan Culture.
Similar tracks were also found at Yanshi, a city of the Erlitou culture, dating to around 1700 BCE.
The earliest evidence of spoked wheels in China comes from Qinghai, in the form of two wheel hubs from a site dated between 2000 and 1500 BCE.
In Britain, a large wooden wheel, measuring about 1 m (3.3 ft) in diameter, was uncovered at the Must Farm site in East Anglia in 2016.
The specimen, dating from 1,100 to 800 BCE, represents the most complete and earliest of its type found in Britain.
The wheel's hub is also present.
A horse's spine found nearby suggests the wheel may have been part of a horse-drawn cart.
The wheel was found in a settlement built on stilts over wetland, indicating that the settlement had some sort of link to dry land.
Although large-scale use of wheels did not occur in the Americas prior to European contact, numerous small wheeled artifacts, identified as children's toys, have been found in Mexican archeological sites, some dating to approximately 1500 BCE.
Some argue that the primary obstacle to large-scale development of the wheel in the Americas was the absence of domesticated large animals that could be used to pull wheeled carriages.
The closest relative of cattle present in Americas in pre-Columbian times, the American bison, is difficult to domesticate and was never domesticated by Native Americans; several horse species existed until about 12,000 years ago, but ultimately became extinct.
The only large animal that was domesticated in the Western hemisphere, the llama, a pack animal, was not physically suited to use as a draft animal to pull wheeled vehicles, and use of the llama did not spread far beyond the Andes by the time of the arrival of Europeans.
On the other hand, Mesoamericans never developed the wheelbarrow, the potter's wheel, nor any other practical object with a wheel or wheels.
Although present in a number of toys, very similar to those found throughout the world and still made for children today ("pull toys"), the wheel was never put into practical use in Mesoamerica before the 16th century.
Possibly the closest the Mayas came to the utilitarian wheel is the spindle whorl, and some scholars believe that these toys were originally made with spindle whorls and spindle sticks as "wheels" and "axes".
Aboriginal Australians traditionally used circular discs rolled along the ground for target practice.
Nubians from after about 400 BCE used wheels for spinning pottery and as water wheels.
It is thought that Nubian waterwheels may have been ox-driven.
It is also known that Nubians used horse-drawn chariots imported from Egypt.
The spoked wheel was in continued use without major modification until the 1870s, when wire-spoked wheels and pneumatic tires were invented.
Pneumatic tires can greatly reduce rolling resistance and improve comfort.
Wire spokes are under tension, not compression, making it possible for the wheel to be both stiff and light.
Early radially-spoked wire wheels gave rise to tangentially-spoked wire wheels, which were widely used on cars into the late 20th century.
Cast alloy wheels are now more commonly used; forged alloy wheels are used when weight is critical.
The invention of the wheel has also been important for technology in general, important applications including the water wheel, the cogwheel (see also antikythera mechanism), the spinning wheel, and the astrolabe or torquetum.
More modern descendants of the wheel include the propeller, the jet engine, the flywheel (gyroscope) and the turbine.
The normal force at the sliding interface is same as with simple dragging.
The sliding distance is reduced for a given distance of travel.
The coefficient of friction at the interface is usually lower.
If a 100 kg object is dragged for 10 m along a surface with the coefficient of friction μ = 0.5, the normal force is 981 N and the work done (required energy) is (work=force x distance) 981 × 0.5 × 10 = 4905 joules.
Now give the object 4 wheels.
The normal force between the 4 wheels and axles is the same (in total) 981 N. Assume, for wood, μ = 0.25, and say the wheel diameter is 1000 mm and axle diameter is 50 mm.
So while the object still moves 10 m the sliding frictional surfaces only slide over each other a distance of 0.5 m. The work done is 981 × 0.25 × 0.5 = 123 joules; the work done has reduced to 1/40 of that of dragging.
Additional energy is lost from the wheel-to-road interface.
This is termed rolling resistance which is predominantly a deformation loss.
It depends on the nature of the ground, of the material of the wheel, its inflation in the case of a tire, the net torque exerted by the eventual engine, and many other factors.
A wheel can also offer advantages in traversing irregular surfaces if the wheel radius is sufficiently large compared to the irregularities.
The wheel alone is not a machine, but when attached to an axle in conjunction with bearing, it forms the wheel and axle, one of the simple machines.
A driven wheel is an example of a wheel and axle.
Wheels pre-date driven wheels by about 6000 years, themselves an evolution of using round logs as rollers to move a heavy load—a practice going back in pre-history so far that it has not been dated.
The rim is the "outer edge of a wheel, holding the tire".
It makes up the outer circular design of the wheel on which the inside edge of the tire is mounted on vehicles such as automobiles.
For example, on a bicycle wheel the rim is a large hoop attached to the outer ends of the spokes of the wheel that holds the tire and tube.
In the 1st millennium BCE an iron rim was introduced around the wooden wheels of chariots.
The hub is the center of the wheel, and typically houses a bearing, and is where the spokes meet.
A hubless wheel (also known as a rim-rider or centerless wheel) is a type of wheel with no center hub.
More specifically, the hub is actually almost as big as the wheel itself.
The axle is hollow, following the wheel at very close tolerances.
A spoke is one of some number of rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface.
The term originally referred to portions of a log which had been split lengthwise into four or six sections.
The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape.
A spokeshave is a tool originally developed for this purpose.
Eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the wheelwright's work, than to the materials used.
The rims of wire wheels (or "wire spoked wheels") are connected to their hubs by wire spokes.
Although these wires are generally stiffer than a typical wire rope, they function mechanically the same as tensioned flexible wires, keeping the rim true while supporting applied loads.
Wire wheels are used on most bicycles and still used on many motorcycles.
They were invented by aeronautical engineer George Cayley and first used in bicycles by James Starley.
A process of assembling wire wheels is described as wheelbuilding.
A tire (in American English and Canadian English) or tyre (in some Commonwealth Nations such as UK, India, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand) is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance by providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock while keeping the wheel in close contact with the ground.
The word itself may be derived from the word "tie", which refers to the outer steel ring part of a wooden cart wheel that ties the wood segments together (see Etymology above).
The fundamental materials of modern tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric, and wire, along with other compound chemicals.
They consist of a tread and a body.
The tread provides traction while the body ensures support.
Before rubber was invented, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear.
Today, the vast majority of tires are pneumatic inflatable structures, comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion.
Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, such as cars, bicycles, motorcycles, trucks, earthmovers, and aircraft.
Extreme off-road conditions have resulted in the invention of several types of wheel cover, which may be constructed as removable attachments or as permanent covers.
Wheels like this are no longer necessarily round, or have panels that make the ground-contact area flat.
Snow chains - Specially designed chain assemblies that wrap around the tire to provide increased grip, designed for deep snow.
Dreadnaught wheel - A type of permanently attached hinged panels for general extreme off-road use.
These are not connected directly to the wheels, but to each other.
Pedrail wheel - A system of rails that holds panels that hold the vehicle.
These do not necessarily have to be built as a circle (wheel) and are thus also a form of Continuous track.
A version of the above examples (name unknown to the writer) was commonly used on heavy artillery during World War I. Specific examples: Cannone da 149/35 A and the Big Bertha.
These were panels that were connected to each other by multiple hinges and could be installed over a contemporary wheel.
Continuous track - A system of linked and hinged chains/panels that cover multiple wheels in a way that allows the vehicles mass to be distributed across the space between wheels that are positioned in front of / behind other wheels.
"Tire totes" - A bag designed to cover a tire to improve traction in deep snow.
Truck and bus wheels may block (stop rotating) under certain circumstances, such as brake system failure.
To help detect this, they sometimes feature "wheel rotation indicators": colored strips of plastic attached to the rim and protruding out from it, such that they can be seen by the driver in the side-view mirrors.
These devices were invented and patented in 1998 by a Canadian truck shop owner.
The wheel has also become a strong cultural and spiritual metaphor for a cycle or regular repetition (see chakra, reincarnation, Yin and Yang among others).
As such and because of the difficult terrain, wheeled vehicles were forbidden in old Tibet.
The wheel in ancient China is seen as a symbol of health and strength and used by some villages as a tool to predict future health and success.
The diameter of the wheel is indicator of one's future health.
The Kalachakra or wheel of time is also a subject in some forms of Buddhism, along with the dharmachakra.
The winged wheel is a symbol of progress, seen in many contexts including the coat of arms of Panama, the logo of the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the State Railway of Thailand.
The wheel is also the prominent figure on the flag of India.
The wheel in this case represents law (dharma).
It also appears in the flag of the Romani people, hinting to their nomadic history and their Indian origins.
The introduction of spoked (chariot) wheels in the Middle Bronze Age appears to have carried somewhat of a prestige.
The sun cross appears to have a significance in Bronze Age religion, replacing the earlier concept of a solar barge with the more 'modern' and technologically advanced solar chariot.
The wheel was also a solar symbol for the Ancient Egyptians.
In modern usage, the 'invention of the wheel' can be considered as a symbol of one of the first technologies of early civilization, alongside farming and metalwork, and thus be used as a benchmark to grade the level of societal progress.
Some Neopagans such as Wiccans have adopted the Wheel of the Year into their religious practices.
Wikisource is an online digital library of free-content textual sources on a wiki, operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.
Wikisource is the name of the project as a whole and the name for each instance of that project (each instance usually representing a different language); multiple Wikisources make up the overall project of Wikisource.
The project's aim is to host all forms of free text, in many languages, and translations.
Originally conceived as an archive to store useful or important historical texts, it has expanded to become a general-content library.
The project officially began on November 24, 2003, under the name Project Sourceberg, a play on Project Gutenberg.
The name Wikisource was adopted later that year and it received its own domain name.
The project holds works that are either in the public domain or freely licensed; professionally published works or historical source documents, not vanity products.
Verification was initially made offline, or by trusting the reliability of other digital libraries.
Now works are supported by online scans via the ProofreadPage extension, which ensures the reliability and accuracy of the project's texts.
Some individual Wikisources, each representing a specific language, now only allow works backed up with scans.
While the bulk of its collection are texts, Wikisource as a whole hosts other media, from comics to film to audiobooks.
Some Wikisources allow user-generated annotations, subject to the specific policies of the Wikisource in question.
The project has come under criticism for lack of reliability but it is also cited by organisations such as the National Archives and Records Administration.
As of July 2024, there are Wikisource subdomains active for 77 languages comprising a total of 6,101,384 articles and 2,316 recently active editors.
The original concept for Wikisource was as storage for useful or important historical texts.
These texts were intended to support Wikipedia articles, by providing primary evidence and original source texts, and as an archive in its own right.
The collection was initially focused on important historical and cultural material, distinguishing it from other digital archives like Project Gutenberg.
The project was originally called Project Sourceberg during its planning stages (a play on words for Project Gutenberg).
The project began its activity at ps.wikipedia.org.
The contributors understood the "PS" subdomain to mean either "primary sources" or Project Sourceberg.
However, this resulted in Project Sourceberg occupying the subdomain of the Pashto Wikipedia (the ISO language code of the Pashto language is "ps").
Project Sourceberg officially launched on November 24, 2003, when it received its own temporary URL, at sources.wikipedia.org, and all texts and discussions hosted on ps.wikipedia.org were moved to the temporary address.
A vote on the project's name changed it to Wikisource on December 6, 2003.
Despite the change in name, the project did not move to its permanent URL (http://wikisource.org/) until July 23, 2004.
Since Wikisource was initially called "Project Sourceberg", its first logo was a picture of an iceberg.
Two votes conducted to choose a successor were inconclusive, and the original logo remained until 2006.
Finally, for both legal and technical reasons—because the picture's license was inappropriate for a Wikimedia Foundation logo and because a photo cannot scale properly—a stylized vector iceberg inspired by the original picture was mandated to serve as the project's logo.
The first prominent use of Wikisource's slogan—The Free Library—was at the project's multilingual portal, when it was redesigned based upon the Wikipedia portal on August 27, 2005, (historical version).
As in the Wikipedia portal the Wikisource slogan appears around the logo in the project's ten largest languages.
Clicking on the portal's central images (the iceberg logo in the center and the "Wikisource" heading at the top of the page) links to a list of translations for Wikisource and The Free Library in 60 languages.
A MediaWiki extension called ProofreadPage was developed for Wikisource by developer ThomasV to improve the vetting of transcriptions by the project.
This displays pages of scanned works side by side with the text relating to that page, allowing the text to be proofread and its accuracy later verified independently by any other editor.
Once a book, or other text, has been scanned, the raw images can be modified with image processing software to correct for page rotations and other problems.
The retouched images can then be converted into a PDF or DjVu file and uploaded to either Wikisource or Wikimedia Commons.
This system assists editors in ensuring the accuracy of texts on Wikisource.
The original page scans of completed works remain available to any user so that errors may be corrected later and readers may check texts against the originals.
ProofreadPage also allows greater participation, since access to a physical copy of the original work is not necessary to be able to contribute to the project once images have been uploaded.
Within two weeks of the project's official start at sources.wikipedia.org, over 1,000 pages had been created, with approximately 200 of these being designated as actual articles.
On January 4, 2004, Wikisource welcomed its 100th registered user.
In early July, 2004 the number of articles exceeded 2,400, and more than 500 users had registered.
On April 30, 2005, there were 2667 registered users (including 18 administrators) and almost 19,000 articles.
The project passed its 96,000th edit that same day.
On November 27, 2005, the English Wikisource passed 20,000 text-units in its third month of existence, already holding more texts than did the entire project in April (before the move to language subdomains).
On May 10, 2006, the first Wikisource Portal was created.
On February 14, 2008, the English Wikisource passed 100,000 text-units with Chapter LXXIV of Six Months at the White House, a memoir by painter Francis Bicknell Carpenter.
In November, 2011, 250,000 text-units milestone was passed.
Wikisource collects and stores in digital format previously published texts; including novels, non-fiction works, letters, speeches, constitutional and historical documents, laws and a range of other documents.
All texts collected are either free of copyright or released under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.
Texts in all languages are welcome, as are translations.
In addition to texts, Wikisource hosts material such as comics, films, recordings and spoken-word works.
All texts held by Wikisource must have been previously published; the project does not host "vanity press" books or documents produced by its contributors.
A scanned source is preferred on many Wikisources and required on some.
Most Wikisources will, however, accept works transcribed from offline sources or acquired from other digital libraries.
The requirement for prior publication can also be waived in a small number of cases if the work is a source document of notable historical importance.
The legal requirement for works to be licensed or free of copyright remains constant.
The only original pieces accepted by Wikisource are annotations and translations.
Wikisource, and its sister project Wikibooks, has the capacity for annotated editions of texts.
On Wikisource, the annotations are supplementary to the original text, which remains the primary objective of the project.
By contrast, on Wikibooks the annotations are primary, with the original text as only a reference or supplement, if present at all.
Annotated editions are more popular on the German Wikisource.
The project also accommodates translations of texts provided by its users.
A significant translation on the English Wikisource is the Wiki Bible project, intended to create a new, "laissez-faire translation" of The Bible.
A separate Hebrew version of Wikisource (he.wikisource.org) was created in August 2004.
The need for a language-specific Hebrew website derived from the difficulty of typing and editing Hebrew texts in a left-to-right environment (Hebrew is written right-to-left).
In the ensuing months, contributors in other languages including German requested their own wikis, but a December vote on the creation of separate language domains was inconclusive.
Finally, a second vote that ended May 12, 2005, supported the adoption of separate language subdomains at Wikisource by a large margin, allowing each language to host its texts on its own wiki.
An initial wave of 14 languages was set up on August 23, 2005.
The new languages did not include English, but the code en: was temporarily set to redirect to the main website (wikisource.org).
At this point the Wikisource community, through a mass project of manually sorting thousands of pages and categories by language, prepared for a second wave of page imports to local wikis.
On September 11, 2005, the wikisource.org wiki was reconfigured to enable the English version, along with 8 other languages that were created early that morning and late the night before.
Three more languages were created on March 29, 2006, and then another large wave of 14 language domains was created on June 2, 2006.
Languages without subdomains are locally incubated.
As of September 2020, 182 languages are hosted locally.
As of July 2024, there are Wikisource subdomains for 79 languages of which 77 are active and 2 are closed.
The active sites have 6,101,384 articles and the closed sites have 13 articles.
There are 4,924,111 registered users of which 2,316 are recently active.
To be a multilingual coordination site for the entire Wikisource project in all languages.
In practice, use of the website for multilingual coordination has not been heavy since the conversion to language domains.
Nevertheless, there is some policy activity at the Scriptorium, and multilingual updates for news and language milestones at pages such as Wikisource:2007.
To be a home for texts in languages without their own subdomains, each with its own local main page for self-organization.
As a language incubator, the wiki currently provides a home for over 30 languages that do not yet have their own language subdomains.
Some of these are very active, and have built libraries with hundreds of texts (such as Volapük).
To provide direct, ongoing support by a local wiki community for a dynamic multilingual portal at its Main Page, for users who go to http://wikisource.org.
The current Main Page portal was created on August 26, 2005, by ThomasV, who based it upon the Wikipedia portal.
The idea of a project-specific coordination wiki, first realized at Wikisource, also took hold in another Wikimedia project, namely at Wikiversity's Beta Wiki.
Like wikisource.org, it serves Wikiversity coordination in all languages, and as a language incubator, but unlike Wikisource, its Main Page does not serve as its multilingual portal.
Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger has criticised Wikisource, and sister project Wiktionary, because the collaborative nature and technology of these projects means there is no oversight by experts and therefore their content is not reliable.
Bart D. Ehrman, a New Testament scholar and professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has criticised the English Wikisource's project to create a user-generated translation of the Bible saying "Democratization isn't necessarily good for scholarship."
Richard Elliott Friedman, an Old Testament scholar and professor of Jewish studies at the University of Georgia, identified errors in the translation of the Book of Genesis as of 2008.
In 2010, Wikimedia France signed an agreement with the Bibliothèque nationale de France (National Library of France) to add scans from its own Gallica digital library to French Wikisource.
Fourteen hundred public domain French texts were added to the Wikisource library as a result via upload to the Wikimedia Commons.
The quality of the transcriptions, previously automatically generated by optical character recognition (OCR), was expected to be improved by Wikisource's human proofreaders.
In 2011, the English Wikisource received many high-quality scans of documents from the US National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as part of their efforts "to increase the accessibility and visibility of its holdings."
Processing and upload to Commons of these documents, along with many images from the NARA collection, was facilitated by a NARA Wikimedian in residence, Dominic McDevitt-Parks.
Many of these documents have been transcribed and proofread by the Wikisource community and are featured as links in the National Archives' own online catalog.
A wildlife corridor, habitat corridor, or green corridor is an area of habitat connecting wildlife populations separated by human activities or structures (such as development, roads, or land clearings), allowing the movement of individuals between populations, that may help prevent negative effects of inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity (via genetic drift) that can occur within isolated populations.
Corridors also help facilitate the re-establishment of populations that have been reduced or eliminated due to random events (such as fires or disease) and may moderate some of the worst effects of habitat fragmentation, through urbanization that splits up habitat areas, causing animals to lose both their natural habitat and the ability to move between regions to access resources.
Habitat fragmentation due to human development is an ever-increasing threat to biodiversity, and habitat corridors serve to manage its effects.
Colonization—animals are able to move and occupy new areas when food sources or other natural resources are lacking in their core habitat.
Migration—species that relocate seasonally can do so more safely and effectively when it does not interfere with human development barriers.
Interbreeding—animals can find new mates in neighboring regions, increasing genetic diversity.
Daniel Rosenberg et al. were among the first to define what constitutes a wildlife corridor, developing a conceptual model that emphasized the role of a wildlife corridor as a facilitator of movement that is not restricted by requirements of native vegetation or intermediate target patches of habitat.
Wildlife corridors also have strong indirect effects on plant populations by increasing pollen and seed dispersal from animals and facilitating movement of disparate taxa between isolated patches.
Corridors must be large enough to support minimum critical populations, reduce migration barriers, and maximize connectivity between populations.
Wildlife corridors may also encompass aquatic habitats (often called riparian ribbons) and usually come in the form of rivers and streams.
Terrestrial corridors can come in the form of wooded strips connecting woodland areas or an urban hedge.
Most species can be categorized in one of two groups: passage users and corridor dwellers.
Passage users occupy corridors for brief periods of time.
These animals use corridors for such events as seasonal migration, dispersal of juveniles, or moving between parts of a large home range.
Animals such as large herbivores, medium to large carnivores, and migratory species are passage users.
Corridor dwellers can occupy the passage anywhere between several days to several years.
Species such as plants, reptiles, amphibians, birds, insects, and small mammals can spend their entire lives in linear habitats.
In this case, the corridor must provide sufficient resources to support such species.
Regional – (>500 metres (1,600 ft) wide); connect major ecological gradients such as migratory pathways.
Sub-regional – (>300 metres (980 ft) wide); connect larger vegetated landscape features such as ridge lines and valley floors.
Local – (some <50 metres (160 ft)); connect remnant patches of gullies, wetlands, ridge lines, etc.
Habitat corridors can also be divided according to their continuity.
Continuous corridors are strips that are not broken up, while "stepping stone" corridors are small patches of suitable habitat.
However, stepping-stone corridors may be more susceptible to edge effects.
Corridors can also take the form of wildlife crossings, underpasses or overpasses used for crossing man-made features such as roads, reducing human-wildlife conflict such as roadkill.
Observations have shown that underpasses are more successful than overpasses as most animals are too timid to cross over a bridge in front of traffic and prefer to be hidden.
Researchers use mark-recapture techniques and hair snares in order to evaluate genetic flow and observe how a corridor is being used.
Marking and recapturing animals is useful when observing individual movement.
However, tagging does not provide insight on whether the migrating individuals are successfully breeding with other populations.
Genetic techniques can be more effective when evaluating migration and mating patterns.
By looking at a population's gene flow, researchers can understand the genetic consequences of corridors using information about the migration patterns of a population over time.
Wildlife corridors are most effective when they are designed with the ecology of their target species in mind.
Other factors like seasonal movement, avoidance behavior, dispersal, and habitat requirements are to be considered.
Corridors are best built with a certain degree of randomness or asymmetry and when oriented perpendicular to habitat patches.
Wildlife corridors are susceptible to edge effects; habitat quality along the edge of a habitat fragment is often much lower than in core habitat areas.
Habitat corridors are important for large species requiring significant-sized ranges; however, they are also vital as connection corridors for smaller animals and plants, as well as ecological connectors to provide a ‟rescue effect’’.
Wildlife corridors are additionally designed to reduce human-wildlife conflicts.
In Alberta, Canada, overpasses have been constructed to keep animals off the Trans-Canada Highway, which passes through Banff National Park.
The tops of the bridges are planted with trees and native grasses, with fences present on either side to help guide animals.
In Southern California, 15 underpasses and drainage culverts were observed to see how many animals used them as corridors.
They proved to be especially effective on wide-ranging species such as carnivores, mule deer, small mammals, and reptiles, even though the corridors were not intended specifically for animals.
Researchers also learned that factors such as surrounding habitat, underpass dimensions, and human activity played a role in the frequency of usage.
In South Carolina, five remnant areas of land were monitored; one was put in the center with the other four surrounding it.
Then, a corridor was put between one of the remnants and the center.
Butterflies that were placed in the center habitat were two to four times more likely to move to the connected remnant rather than the disconnected ones.
Furthermore, male holly plants were placed in the center region, and female holly plants in the connected region increased by 70 percent in seed production compared to those plants in the disconnected region.
Plant seeds dispersal through bird droppings was noted to be the dispersal method with the largest increase within the corridor-connected patch of land.
The positive effects on the rates of transfer and interbreeding in vole populations.
A control population in which voles were confined to their core habitat with no corridor was compared to a treatment population in their core habitat with passages that they  use to move to other regions.
Females typically stayed and mated within their founder population, but the rate of transfer through corridors in the males was very high.
In 2001, a wolf corridor was restored through a golf course in Jasper National Park, Alberta, which successfully altered wildlife behavior and showed frequent use by the wolf population.
The Siju-Rewak Corridor, located in the Garo Hills of India, protects an important population of elephants (thought to be approximately 20% of all the elephants that survive in the country).
This corridor project links together the Siju Wildlife Sanctuary and the Rewak Reserve Forest in Meghalaya State, close to the India-Bangladesh border.
This area lies within the meeting place of the Himalayan Mountain Range and the Indian Peninsula and contains at least 139 other species of mammals, including tigers, clouded leopards and the Himalayan black bear.
The 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) long Kanha-Pench elevated corridor on NH 44.
Two elephant passes and two minor bridges on NH 54 in Assam’s Lumding Reserve Forest.
Three elephant underpasses, each with 6 metres (20 ft) of vertical clearance on NH 72 and NH 58 in Uttarakhand, India.
Terai Arc Landscapes, Lower Himalayan Region.
Some species are more likely to utilize habitat corridors depending on migration and mating patterns, making it essential that corridor design is targeted towards a specific species.
Due to space constraints, buffers are not usually implemented.
Without a buffer zone, corridors can become affected by disturbances from human land use change.
There is a possibility that corridors could aid in the spread of invasive species, threatening native populations.
Windshield washer fluid (also called windshield wiper fluid, wiper fluid, screen wash (in the UK), or washer fluid) is a fluid for motor vehicles that is used in cleaning the windshield with the windshield wiper while the vehicle is being driven.
A control within the car can be operated to spray washer fluid onto the windshield, typically using an electrical pump via jets mounted either beneath the windshield or beneath the wiper blade(s).
The windshield wipers are automatically turned on, cleaning dirt and debris off the windshield.
Some vehicles use the same method to clean the rear window or the headlights.
The first windshield cleaner unit offered for automobiles was in 1936, as an aftermarket option to be installed on cars after they were bought.
In 1946 General Motors installed windshield washers on all their vehicles as an extra cost option, while Chrysler offered the feature optionally in 1950 and Ford offered them for 1952.
Washer fluid may sometimes be preheated before being delivered onto the windshield.
This is especially desirable in colder climates when a thin layer of ice or frost accumulates on the windshield's surface, as it eliminates the need to manually scrape the windshield or pour warm water on the glass.
Although there are a few aftermarket preheat devices available, many automobile makers offer this feature factory installed on at least some of their vehicles.
For example, General Motors had begun equipping vehicles with heated washer fluid systems from the factory beginning in 2006 with the Buick Lucerne sedan.
The system emits a fine mist of heated water that clears frost without damaging the windshield itself.
GM also claims heated washer fluid helps in removing bug splatters and other road accumulation.
The company halted the production of these mechanisms after they found that it was prone to start engine fires.
Mercedes Benz has used a thermostatically controlled heating element, with the engine coolant as the heat source, since the mid 1980s on certain models.
Many other manufacturers have employed electrically heated washer nozzles primarily to prevent them from freezing closed, not in an attempt to heat the fluid itself.
Windshield washer fluid is sold in many formulations, some are pre-mixed and others require dilution before use.
Common washer fluid solutions are given labels such as "All-Season", "Bug Remover", or "De-icer".
Typical formulations include a surfactant, water softener, and an antifreeze.
Alkyl sulfates and fatty alcohol ethers are typical surfactants.
Dilution factors will vary depending on season, for example in winter, the dilution factor may be 1:1, whereas during summer the dilution factor may be 1:10.
It is sometimes sold as sachet of crystals, which is also diluted with water.
Distilled or deionised water is the preferred diluent, since it will not leave trace mineral deposits on the glass.
Anti-freeze may be added to a mixture to give the product a lower freezing temperature.
Antifreezes are typically ethanol and ethylene glycol.
Many cars display a warning when the fluid level is low, and some car makers have replaced the float sensor generating this signal with a simple two-pin probe in the tank.
This requires a (slightly) conductive fluid, but most common windshield washer fluid mixtures will work.
Mercedes-Benz sells a special fluid for their cars.
Consumer advocacy groups and auto enthusiasts believe that the solvents present in some windshield washer fluid can damage the vehicle.
Critics point to the corrosive effects of ethanol, methanol, and other components on paint, rubber, car wax, and plastics, and groups propose various alternatives and homemade recipes to protect the finish and mechanics of the motor vehicle.

Wilhelm Maybach (German: [ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈmaɪbax] ; 9 February 1846 – 29 December 1929) was an early German engine designer and industrialist.
During the 1890s he was hailed in France, then the world centre for car production, as the "King of Designers".
From the late 19th century Wilhelm Maybach, together with Gottlieb Daimler, developed light, high-speed internal combustion engines suitable for land, water, and air use.
These were fitted to the world's first motorcycle, motorboat, and after Daimler's death, a new automobile introduced in late 1902, the Mercedes model, built to the specifications of Emil Jellinek.
Maybach rose to become technical director of the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) but did not get along with its chairmen.
As a result, Maybach left DMG in 1907 to found Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH together with his son Karl in 1909; they manufactured Zeppelin engines.
After the signing of the Versailles Treaty in 1919 the company started producing large luxury vehicles, branded as "Maybach".
He died in 1929 and was succeeded by his son Karl Maybach.
From around 1936 Maybach-Motorenbau designed and made almost all the engines fitted in German tanks and half-tracks used during World War 2, including those for the Panther, Tiger I and Tiger II heavy tanks.
Continuing after the war, Maybach Motorenbau remained a subsidiary of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin, making diesel engines.
During the 1960s Maybach came under the control of Daimler-Benz and was renamed MTU Friedrichshafen.
In 2002 the Maybach brand name was revived for a luxury make but it was not successful.
On 25 November 2011 Daimler-Benz announced they would cease producing automobiles under the Maybach brand name in 2013.
In 2014, Daimler announced production of an ultra-luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class under the new Mercedes-Maybach brand.
Wilhelm Maybach was born in Heilbronn, Baden-Württemberg, in 1846, the son of a carpenter and his wife Luise.
He had four brothers.
When he was eight years old the family moved from Löwenstein near Heilbronn to Stuttgart.
His mother died in 1854 and his father in 1856.
After his relatives published an announcement in the Stuttgarter Anzeiger newspaper, a philanthropic institution at Reutlingen took in Maybach as a student.
Its founder and director, Gustav Werner, discovered Maybach's technical inclination and helped to stimulate his career by sending him to the school's engineering workshop.
At 15 years old (1861), Maybach was heading for a career in Industrial design and took extra classes in physics and mathematics at Reutlingen's public high school.
By the time he was 19 years old, he was a qualified designer working on stationary engines.
His workshop manager, Gottlieb Daimler, then 29, noticed his efforts and took him on as his main assistant, a post he held until Daimler's death in 1900.
In 1869, Maybach followed Daimler to Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe AG in Karlsruhe, a manufacturer of heavy locomotives.
Daimler was on the Executive Committee and they spent long nights discussing new designs for engines, pumps, lumber machinery, and metalworking.
In 1872, Daimler moved to Deutz-AG-Gasmotorenfabrik in Cologne, then the world's largest manufacturer of stationary gas engines.
Nicolaus Otto, part owner of the company, focused on engine development with Daimler.
Maybach joined them as Chief Designer.
In 1876, Nicolaus Otto patented the Otto cycle engine.
It was a four-stroke cycle gas internal combustion engine with intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes.
One of Otto's more than 25 patents on this engine was later challenged and overturned, allowing Daimler and Maybach to produce their high-speed engine.
Also in 1876, Maybach was sent to show Deutz's engines at the Philadelphia World's Fair (USA).
On returning to Cologne in 1877, he concentrated on improving the four-stroke design to prepare it for its impending commercial launch.
In 1878, Maybach married Bertha Wilhelmine Habermaas, a friend of Daimler's wife, Emma Kunz.
Her family members were landowners who ran the post office in Maulbronn.
On 6 July 1879 Karl Maybach was born, the first of their three children.
In 1880, Daimler and Otto had serious disagreements, resulting in Daimler's leaving Deutz-AG.
Daimler received 112,000 goldmarks in Deutz-AG shares as compensation for patents granted to him and Maybach.
Maybach also left shortly afterwards, and followed his friend to found a new company in Cannstatt.
In 1882, Maybach moved to Taubenheimstrasse in Cannstatt, Stuttgart, where Daimler had purchased a house with 75,000 goldmarks from his Deutz compensation.
They added a brick extension to the glass-fronted summer house in the garden, which became their workshop.
Their activities alarmed the neighbours, who suspected they were engaged in counterfeiting.
The police raided the property in their absence using the gardener's key, but found only engines.
In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach patented the first of their engines fueled by Ligroin.
This engine was patented on 16 December 1883.
It achieved Daimler's goal of being small and running fast enough to be useful at 750 rpm (soon after up to 900).
Daimler had three engines built in 1884.
Maybach persuaded him to put one in a vehicle, the result being the Reitwagen.
In 1884, Maybach's second son Adolf was born.
a speed of 600 rpm, when at the time most engines could only achieve about 120 to 180 rpm.
Daimler baptized it the Standuhr (lit.
"grandfather clock"), because of its resemblance to a pendulum clock.
In November 1885, Daimler installed a smaller version of the engine onto a wooden bicycle, creating the first motorcycle (patent 36-423 – Vehicle with gas or petroleum engine), and Maybach drove it three kilometers from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim, reaching 12 km/h (7.5 mph).
It became known as the Reitwagen.
On 8 March 1886, the inventors bought  an American model coach built by Wilhelm Wimpff & Sohn, telling the neighbors that it was a birthday gift for Mrs. Daimler.
Maybach supervised the installation of an enlarged 1.5 hp Grandfather Clock engine onto the coach, and installed a  belt drive to the wheels.
The vehicle reached 15 km/h (9.3 mph) when tested on the road to Untertürkheim.
On water (1887).
It was mounted in a 4.5-metre-long boat which achieved 6 knots (11 km/h).
The boat was called the Neckar after the river it was tested on and was registered as patent number DRP 39-367.
Motor boat engines would become their main product until the first decade of the 1900s.
In the air.
They built the first motorized airship, a balloon based on designs by Dr. Friedrich Hermann Wölfert from Leipzig.
They replaced his hand-operated drive system and flew over Seelberg successfully on 10 August 1888.
By 1887 they were licensing their first patents abroad, and Maybach represented the company at the great Paris Exposition Universelle (1889).
Sales increased, mostly from the Neckar motorboat.
In June 1887, Daimler bought land in the Seelberg Hills of Cannstatt.
The workshop was some distance from the town on Ludwig Route 67, because Cannstatt's mayor objected to the presence of the workshop in the town.
It covered 2,903 square meters and cost 30,200 goldmarks.
They initially employed 23 people.
Daimler managed the commercial issues and Maybach the design department.
In 1889 they built their first automobile to be designed from scratch rather than as an adaptation of a stagecoach.
It was publicly launched by both inventors in Paris in October 1889.
Resources were scant to keep the business going, as neither the engine sales nor the worldwide proceeds from their patents were yielding enough money.
Fresh capital was injected by bringing in the financiers Max von Duttenhofer and William Lorenz, former munitions makers, who were associated with Kilian von Steiner, the owner of a German investment bank.
The company was taken public.
In 1890, Daimler and Maybach together founded the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, the Daimler Motor Corporation or DMG for short, which was dedicated to the construction of small high-speed internal combustion engines for land, water, or air transport.
Maybach was Chief Designer.
After spending long hours debating which fuel was best to use in Otto's four-stroke engine, which had normally used methane gas as a fuel, they turned to petroleum which until then had been used mainly as a cleaner and sold in pharmacies.
as the following decade was chaotic for Daimler and Maybach.
DMG continued to expand, selling engines from Moscow to New York, and additional stationary engine-making capacity was added, but the belief continued that automobile production would not be profitable.
The new chairmen planned to merge DMG and Deutz-AG, in spite of Daimler's disagreement with Nicolaus Otto.
Gottlieb Daimler and Chief Engineer Maybach preferred to produce automobiles and reacted against Duttenhofer and Lorenz in particular.
Maybach was rejected as a member of the Board of Management and left the company on 11 February 1891, and continued his design work from his own house, financed by Daimler.
In late 1892, he set up a shop in the ballroom of the former Hermann Hotel and Winter Garden where he employed 17 workers, five of which were paid by Daimler.
Maybach's creations are considered among the finest motors of the late 19th century.
His inventions became indispensable for any model by any automaker in the world.
He became recognised as the backbone of France's early automobile industry, where he was hailed as the "King of Designers".
Daimler was forced out of his post as Technical Director at DMG and resigned in 1893, which damaged DMG's prestige.
However, in 1894, a British industrialist, Frederick Simms, purchased the rights to the Phoenix engine for 350,000 marks and stabilised the company's finances.
He also made it a condition that Daimler be re-employed.
In 1895 DMG assembled its 1,000th engine, and Maybach also returned as Chief Engineer, obtaining 30,000 goldmarks worth of shares through his original contract with Gottlieb Daimler.
Around this time though Maybach suffered two setbacks.
His teenage second son, Adolf, suffered a schizophrenia attack and spent the rest of his life in various mental institutions.
(In 1940, his son was murdered by the Nazis as part of the Euthanasia Program.)
In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler died of heart disease.
unheard-of power from its 35 hp engine
allowing it to reach 75 km/h (47 mph).
Emil Jellinek, a successful Austrian dealer and racing driver on the French Riviera who greatly admired Maybach's work, promised to buy a shipment of 36 automobiles for 550,000 goldmarks if Maybach could design a great race car for him following his specifications.
The prototype was finished in December 1900 and, in 1901 went on to have a string of racing successes.
Its engine was baptized Daimler-Mercedes (Spanish for mercy) after Mercedes Jellinek, Emil's 10-year–old daughter.
European high society bought the car in large numbers making it the commercial success that convinced the company directors there was a future in automobiles.
Production increased greatly and DMG rapidly increased in size and number of employees.
DMG officially registered the Mercedes trademark in June 1902.
DMG demoted him to an "Inventor's Office" causing him to leave the company again in 1907.
DMG replaced him with Paul Daimler.
That same year, the German Engineers Association (VDI) recognized Wilhelm Maybach as an honorary member.
In 1900, Maybach had his first contact with Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who sought to improve the engines of the Zeppelin LZ1 airship.
Maybach built some engines for him based on sketches of a 150 hp unit created by his son, Karl, while at DMG.
In 1908, Count Zeppelin attempted to sell his models LZ3 and LZ4 to the government.
On 5 August, LZ4 exploded against a row of trees after attempting an emergency landing when its engines failed.
This was far from being the end for the airship project as 6.25 million goldmarks were raised in a donation campaign after the accident.
Count Zeppelin founded the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH, the company that built the Zeppelin airships.
Maybach had to hold off joining the new company for a while as he was still in litigation with DMG, so Karl took his place.
On 23 March 1909, a deal was finally signed, creating an engine subsidiary to Luftschiffbau Zeppelin at Bissingen/Enz, in Württemberg.
Wilhelm Maybach was Technical Assistant and Karl was Technical Manager.
Their first designs reached 72 km/h (45 mph).
Wilhelm Maybach moved his company to Friedrichshafen and renamed it Luftfahrzeug-Motoren-GmbH. Karl and Wilhem held 20% of the shares with an arrangement for Karl to inherit.
They kept supplying Zeppelin, but worked on other airship engines too.
In 1912, the company adopted the name Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH (Maybach Engine Construction Company).
In 1916, they developed a 160 hp aircraft engine which sold 2000 units before the end of World War I. In 1916, Wilhelm Maybach was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the Technical University of Stuttgart.
After the First World War, the Versailles Treaty of 1919 prohibited airship production in Germany, so Maybach turned to making high-speed diesel engines for naval and railroad use, and petrol engines for automobiles, but not complete automobiles.
Many of the small automakers in Germany built their own engines for cost reasons and only the Dutch Spyker company was interested in taking Maybach engines.
Wilhelm Maybach turned down the contract because he could not agree to its conditions.
Instead, he opted to build complete automobiles and the factory began to produce Maybach limousines in 1921.
It was produced until 1928, selling 300 units, mostly with sedan bodies; the two-seat sport version was less successful.
The Maybach W5 followed, with the top speed increased to 135 km/h (84 mph); 250 units sold in 1927 and 1929.
Only a few dozen were sold due to the German postwar economic crisis.
In 1930, its successor, the DS7-Zeppelin, also featured a 12-cylinder engine of 7 liters.
In August 1929, the Zeppelin LZ-127 used five Maybach-V12 petrol engines of 550 hp (410 kW) each.
Wilhelm Maybach died at the age of 83 in Stuttgart on 29 December 1929.
His business, Maybach Motorenbau GmbH, continued in Friedrichshafen under his son Karl Maybach.
From around 1935 Maybach made and designed almost all the engines for tanks and half-tracks used by the German armed forces during World War 2.
After 1945 it manufactured a full range of diesel engines.
In the early 1960s Maybach began to construct large Daimler-Benz engines in Friedrichshafen under a licence agreement and entered close collaboration with Daimler-Benz.
During the mid 1960s Maybach Motorenbau GmbH became Maybach Mercedes-Benz Motorenbau GmbH and 83 percent owned by Daimler-Benz.
In 1998 Mercedes-Benz announced what would prove to be a temporary revival of the Maybach brand for automobiles.
Daimler AG currently produces an ultra luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class under the Mercedes-Maybach brand.
Wilhelm Maybach was accepted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1996.
Three technical Schools in Germany are named Wilhelm Maybach: Stuttgart, Heilbronn, and Berlin-Spandau.
In 2002, Daimler AG began to produce models under the Maybach name.
In 2005, in honor of his grandfather Karl and his great-grandfather Wilhelm, Ulrich Schmid-Maybach founded the Wilhelm and Karl Maybach Foundation.
A wheelchair is a mobilized form of chair using 2 or more wheels, a footrest and armrest usually cushioned.
It is used when walking is difficult or impossible to do due to illnesses, injury, disabilities, or age related health conditions.
Wheelchairs come in a wide variety of formats to meet the specific needs of their users.
They may include specialized seating adaptions, individualized controls, and may be specific to particular activities, as with sports wheelchairs and beach wheelchairs.
The most widely recognized distinction is between motorized wheelchairs, where propulsion is provided by batteries and electric motors, and manual wheelchairs, where the propulsive force is provided either by the wheelchair user or occupant pushing the wheelchair by hand (self-propelled), by an attendant pushing from the rear using the handle(s), or by an attendant pushing from the side use a handle attachment.
The earliest records of wheeled furniture are an inscription found on a stone slate in China and a child's bed depicted in a frieze on a Greek vase, both dating between the 6th and 5th century BC.
The first records of wheeled seats being used for transporting disabled people date to three centuries later in China; the Chinese used early wheelbarrows to move people as well as heavy objects.
A distinction between the two functions was not made for another several hundred years, until around AD 525, when images of wheeled chairs made specifically to carry people begin to occur in Chinese art.
Although Europeans eventually developed a similar design, this method of transportation did not exist until 1595 when an unknown inventor from Spain built one for King Phillip II.
Although it was an elaborate chair having both armrests and leg rests, the design still had shortcomings since it did not feature an efficient propulsion mechanism and thus required assistance to propel it.
This makes the design more comparable to a modern-day highchair or portable throne for the wealthy than to a modern-day wheelchair for disabled people.
In 1655, Stephan Farffler, a 22-year-old paraplegic watchmaker, built the world's first self-propelling chair on a three-wheel chassis using a system of cranks and cogwheels.
However, the device resembled a hand bike more than a wheelchair since the design included hand cranks mounted at the front wheel.
A self-propelled wheelchair was made for the Parliamentarian commander-in-chief Sir Thomas Fairfax due to the many injuries he had received during the English Civil War, and he used it during the final years of his life.
The wheelchair of Thomas Fairfax is currently on display at the National Civil War Centre in Newark-on-Trent.
The invalid carriage or Bath chair brought the technology into more common use from around 1760.
In 1887, wheelchairs ("rolling chairs") were introduced to Atlantic City so invalid tourists could rent them to enjoy the Boardwalk.
Soon, many healthy tourists also rented the decorated "rolling chairs" and servants to push them as a show of decadence and treatment they could never experience at home.
In 1933 Harry C. Jennings Sr. and his disabled friend Herbert Everest, both mechanical engineers, invented the first lightweight, steel, folding, portable wheelchair.
Everest had previously broken his back in a mining accident.
Everest and Jennings saw the business potential of the invention and went on to become the first mass-market manufacturers of wheelchairs.
Their "X-brace" design is still in common use, albeit with updated materials and other improvements.
The X-brace idea came to Jennings from the men's folding "camp chairs / stools", rotated 90 degrees, used in the outdoors and at the mines.
There are a wide variety of types of wheelchairs, differing by propulsion method, mechanisms of control, and technology used.
Some wheelchairs are designed for general everyday use, others for single activities, or to address specific access needs.
Innovation within the wheelchair industry is relatively common, but many innovations ultimately fall by the wayside, either from over-specialization, or from failing to come to market at an accessible price-point.
The iBOT is perhaps the best known example of this in recent years.
A self-propelled manual wheelchair incorporates a frame, seat, one or two footplates (footrests) and four wheels: usually two caster wheels at the front and two large wheels at the back.
There will generally also be a separate seat cushion.
The larger rear wheels usually have push-rims of slightly smaller diameter projecting just beyond the tyre; these allow the user to manoeuvre the chair by pushing on them without requiring them to grasp the tyres.
Manual wheelchairs generally have brakes that bear on the tyres of the rear wheels, however these are solely a parking brakes and in-motion braking is provided by the user's palms bearing directly on the push-rims.
As this causes friction and heat build-up, particularly on long downslopes, many wheelchair users will choose to wear padded wheelchair gloves.
Manual wheelchairs often have two push handles at the upper rear of the frame to allow for manual propulsion by a second person, however many active wheelchair users will remove these to prevent unwanted pushing from people who believe they are being helpful.
Everyday manual wheelchairs come in two major varieties, folding or rigid.
Folding chairs are generally low-end designs, whose predominant advantage is being able to fold, generally by bringing the two sides together.
This is an advantage for people who need to store the wheelchair frequently or to put it in a small vehicle.
Rigid wheelchairs have permanently welded joints and many fewer moving parts.
This reduces the energy required to push the chair by eliminating many points where the chair would flex and absorb energy as it moves.
Welded rather than folding joints also reduce the overall weight of the chair.
Rigid chairs typically feature instant-release rear wheels and backrests that fold down flat, allowing the user to dismantle the chair quickly for storage in a car.
A few wheelchairs attempt to combine the features of both designs by providing a fold-to-rigid mechanism in which the joints are mechanically locked when the wheelchair is in use.
Many rigid models are made with light materials such as aluminium and titanium, and wheelchairs of composite materials such as carbon-fibre have started to appear.
Ultra lightweight rigid wheelchairs are commonly known as 'active user chairs' as they are ideally suited to independent use.
Another innovation in rigid chair design is the installation of shock absorbers, such as "Frog Legs", which cushion the bumps over which the chair rolls.
These shock absorbers may be added to the front wheels, to the rear wheels, or both.
Rigid chairs also have the option for their rear wheels to have a camber, or tilt, which angles the tops of the wheels in toward the chair.
This allows for more mechanically efficient propulsion by the user and also makes it easier to hold a straight line while moving across a slope.
Sport wheelchairs often have large camber angles to improve stability.
Rigid-framed chairs are generally made to measure, to suit both the specific size of the user and their needs and preferences around areas such as the "tippyness" of the chair - determined by the distance between the center of gravity and the rear axle.
Experienced users with sufficient upper-body strength can generally balance the chair on its rear wheels, a "wheelie", and the "tippyness" of the chair controls the ease with which this can be initiated.
The wheelie allows an independent wheelchair user to climb and descend curbs and move more easily over small obstacles and irregular ground such as cobbles.
The rear wheels of self-propelled wheelchairs typically range from 20–24 in (510–610 mm) in diameter, and commonly resemble bicycle wheels.
Wheels are rubber-tired and may be solid, pneumatic or gel-filled.
The wheels of folding chairs may be permanently attached, but those for rigid chairs are commonly fitted with quick-release axles activated by depressing a button at the centre of the wheel.
All major varieties of wheelchairs can be highly customized for the user's needs.
Such customization may encompass the seat dimensions, height, seat angle, footplates, leg rests, front caster outriggers, adjustable backrests and controls.
Various optional accessories are available, such as anti-tip bars or wheels, safety belts, adjustable backrests, tilt and/or recline features, extra support for limbs or head and neck, holders for crutches, walkers or oxygen tanks, drink holders, and mud and wheel-guards as clothing protectors.
Light weight and high costs are related to the manual wheelchair market.
At the low-cost end, heavy, folding steel chairs with sling seats and little adaptability dominate.
Users may be temporarily disabled, or using such a chair as a loaner, or simply unable to afford better.
These chairs are common as "loaners" at large facilities such as airports, amusement parks and shopping centers.
A slightly higher price band sees the same folding design produced in aluminium.
The high end of the market contains ultra-light models, extensive seating options and accessories, all-terrain features, and so forth.
The most expensive manual chairs may rival the cost of a small car.
An attendant-propelled wheelchair is generally similar to a self-propelled manual wheelchair, but with small diameter wheels at both front and rear.
The chair is maneuvered and controlled by a person standing at the rear and pushing on handles incorporated into the frame.
Braking is supplied directly by the attendant who will usually also be provided with a foot- or hand-operated parking brake.
These chairs are common in institutional settings and as loaner-chairs in large public venues.
They are usually constructed from steel as light weight is less of a concern when the user is not required to self-propel.
Specially designed transfer chairs are now required features at airports in much of the developed world in order to allow access down narrow airliner aisles and facilitate the transfer of wheelchair-using passengers to and from their seats on the aircraft.
An electric-powered wheelchair, commonly called a "powerchair" is a wheelchair that additionally incorporates batteries and electric motors into the frame and that is controlled by either the user or an attendant, most commonly via a small joystick mounted on the armrest, or on the upper rear of the frame.
Alternatives exist for the traditional manual joystick, including head switches, chin-operated joysticks, sip-and-puff controllers or other specialist controls, which may allow independent operation of the wheelchair for a wider population of users with varying motor impairments.
Ranges of over 10 miles/15 km are commonly available from standard batteries.
Powerchairs are commonly divided by their access capabilities.
An indoor-chair may only reliably be able to cross completely flat surfaces, limiting them to household use.
An indoor-outdoor chair is less limited, but may have restricted range or ability to deal with slopes or uneven surfaces.
An outdoor chair is more capable, but will still have a very restricted ability to deal with rough terrain.
A very few specialist designs offer a true cross-country capability.
Powerchairs have access to the full range of wheelchair options, including ones that are difficult to provide in an unpowered manual chair, but have the disadvantage of significant extra weight.
Where an ultra-lightweight manual chair may weigh under 10 kg, the largest outdoor power-chairs may weigh 200 kg or more.
Smaller power chairs often have four wheels, with front or rear wheel drive, but large outdoor designs commonly have six wheels, with small wheels at front and rear and somewhat larger powered wheels in the centre.
A power-assisted wheelchair is a recent development that uses the frame and seating of a typical rigid manual chair while replacing the standard rear wheels with wheels of similar size which incorporate batteries and battery-powered motors in the hubs.
A floating rim design senses the pressure applied by the user's push and activates the motors proportionately to provide a power assist.
This results in the convenience, and small size of a manual chair while providing motorised assistance for rough/uneven terrain and steep slopes that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to navigate, especially by those with limited upper-body function.
As the wheels necessarily come at a weight penalty it is often possible to exchange them with standard wheels to match the capabilities of the wheelchair to the current activity.
Mobility scooters share some features with powerchairs, but primarily address a different market segment, people with a limited ability to walk, but who might not otherwise consider themselves disabled.
Smaller mobility scooters are typically three wheeled, with a base on which is mounted a basic seat at the rear, with a control tiller at the front.
Larger scooters are frequently four-wheeled, with a much more substantial seat.
Opinions are often polarized as to whether mobility scooters should be considered wheelchairs or not, and negative stereotyping of scooter users can be worse than for  some manual or power-chair users.
Some commercial organisations draw a distinction between power-chairs and scooters when making access provisions due to a lack of clarity in the law as to whether scooters fall under the same equality legislation as wheelchairs.
One-arm or single arm drive enables a user to self-propel a manual wheelchair using only a single arm.
The large wheel on the same side as the arm to be used is fitted with two concentric handrims, one of smaller diameter than the other.
On most models the outer, smaller rim, is connected to the wheel on the opposite side by an inner concentric axle.
When both handrims are grasped together, the chair may be propelled forward or backward in a straight line.
When either handrim is moved independently, only a single wheel is used and the chair will turn left or right in response to the handrim used.
Some wheelchairs, designed for use by hemiplegics, provide a similar function by linking both wheels rigidly together and using one of the footplates to control steering via a linkage to the front caster.
Reclining or tilt-in-space wheelchairs have seating surfaces that can be tilted to various angles.
The original concept was developed by an orthotist, Hugh Barclay, who worked with disabled children and observed that postural deformities such as scoliosis could be supported or partially corrected by allowing the wheelchair user to relax in a tilted position.
The feature is also of value to users who are unable to sit upright for extended periods for pain or other reasons.
In the case of reclining wheelchairs, the seat-back tilts back, and the leg rests can be raised, while the seat base remains in the same position, somewhat similar to a common recliner chair.
Some reclining wheelchairs lean back far enough that the user can lie down completely flat.
Reclining wheelchairs are preferred in some cases for some medical purposes, such as reducing the risk of pressure sores, providing passive movement of hip and knee joints, and making it easier to perform some nursing procedures, such as intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder and transfers to beds, and also for personal reasons, such as people who like using an attached tray.
The use of reclining wheelchairs is particularly common among people with spinal cord injuries such as quadriplegia.
In the case of tilting wheelchairs, the seat-back, seat base, and leg rests tilt back as one unit, somewhat similar to the way a person might tip a four-legged chair backward to balance it on the back legs.
While fully reclining spreads the person's weight over the entire back side of the body, tilting wheelchairs transfer it from only the buttocks and thighs (in the seated position) to partially on the back and head (in the tilted position).
Tilting wheelchairs are preferred for people who use molded or contoured seats, who need to maintain a particular posture, who adversely affected by sheer forces (reclining causes the body to slide slightly every time), or who need to keep a communication device, powered wheelchair controls, or other attached device in the same relative position throughout the day.
Tilting wheelchairs are commonly used by people with cerebral palsy, people with some muscle diseases, and people with limited range of motion in the hip or knee joints.
Tilting options are more common than reclining options in wheelchairs designed for use by children.
A standing wheelchair is one that supports the user in a nearly standing position.
They can be used as both a wheelchair and a standing frame, allowing the user to sit or stand in the wheelchair as they wish.
Some versions are entirely manual, others have a powered stand on an otherwise manual chair, while others have full power, tilt, recline and variations of powered stand functions available.
The benefits of such a device include, but are not limited to: aiding independence and productivity, raising self-esteem and psychological well-being, heightening social status, extending access, relief of pressure, reduction of pressure sores, improved functional reach, improved respiration, reduced occurrence of UTI, improved flexibility, help in maintaining bone mineral density, improved passive range motion, reduction in abnormal muscle tone and spasticity, and skeletal deformities.
Other wheelchairs provide some of the same benefits by raising the entire seat to lift the user to standing height.
A range of disabled sports have been developed for disabled athletes, including basketball, rugby, tennis, racing and dancing.
The wheelchairs used for each sport have evolved to suit the specific needs of that sport and often no longer resemble their everyday cousins.
They are usually non-folding (in order to increase rigidity), with a pronounced negative camber for the wheels (which provides stability and is helpful for making sharp turns), and often are made of composite, lightweight materials.
Even seating positions may be radically different, with racing wheelchairs generally used in a kneeling position.
Sport wheelchairs are rarely suited for everyday use, and are often a 'second' chair specifically for sports use, although some users prefer the sports options for everyday use.
Some disabled people, specifically lower-limb amputees, may use a wheelchair for sports, but not for everyday activities.
While most wheelchair sports use manual chairs, some power chair sports, such as powerchair football, exist.
Hockey can also be played from electrical wheelchairs.
Wheelchair stretchers are a variant of wheeled stretchers/gurneys that can accommodate a sitting patient, or be adjusted to lie flat to help in the lateral (or supine) transfer of a patient from a bed to the chair or back.
Once transferred, the stretcher can be adjusted to allow the patient to assume a sitting position.
All-terrain wheelchairs can allow users to access terrain otherwise completely inaccessible to a wheelchair user.
Two different formats have been developed.
One hybridises wheelchair and mountain bike technology, generally taking the form of a frame within which the user sits and with four mountain bike wheels at the corners.
In general, there are no push-rims and propulsion/braking is by pushing directly on the tyres.
A more common variant is the beach wheelchair (beach-going wheelchair) which can allow better mobility on beach sand, including in the water, on uneven terrain, and even on snow.
The common adaptation among the different designs is that they have extra-wide balloon wheels or tires, to increase stability and decrease ground pressure on uneven or unsteady terrain.
Different models are available, both manual and battery-driven.
In some countries in Europe, where accessible tourism is well established, many beaches have wheelchairs of this type available for loan/hire.
A smart wheelchair is any powerchair using a control system to augment or replace user control.
Its purpose is to reduce or eliminate the user's task of driving a powerchair.
Usually, a smart wheelchair is controlled via a computer, has a suite of sensors and applies techniques in mobile robotics, but this is not necessary.
The type of sensors most frequently used by smart wheelchairs are the ultrasonic acoustic range finder (i.e. sonar) and infrared red (IR) range finder.
The interface may consist of a conventional wheelchair joystick, a "sip-and-puff" device or a touch-sensitive display.
This differs from a conventional powerchair, in which the user exerts manual control over speed and direction without intervention by the wheelchair's control system.
Smart wheelchairs are designed for a variety of user types.
Some are designed for users with cognitive impairments, such as dementia, these typically apply collision-avoidance techniques to ensure that users do not accidentally select a drive command that results in a collision.
Others focus on users living with severe motor disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, or with quadriplegia, and the role of the smart wheelchair is to interpret small muscular activations as high-level commands and execute them.
Such wheelchairs typically employ techniques from artificial intelligence, such as path-planning.
Recent technological advances are slowly improving wheelchair and powerchair technology.
A variation on the manually-propelled wheelchair is the Leveraged Freedom Chair (LFC), designed by the MIT Mobility Lab.
This wheelchair is designed to be low-cost, constructed with local materials, for users in developing countries.
Engineering modifications have added hand-controlled levers to the LFC, to enable users to move the chair over uneven ground and minor obstacles, such as bumpy dirt roads, that are common in developing countries.
It is under development, and has been tested in Kenya and India so far.
The addition of geared, all-mechanical wheels for manual wheelchairs is a new development incorporating a hypocycloidal reduction gear into the wheel design.
The 2-gear wheels can be added to a manual wheelchair.
The geared wheels provide a user with additional assistance by providing leverage through gearing (like a bicycle, not a motor).
The two-gear wheels offer two speed ratios- 1:1 (no help, no extra torque) and 2:1, providing 100% more hill climbing force.
The low gear incorporates an automatic "hill hold" function which holds the wheelchair in place on a hill between pushes, but will allow the user to override the hill hold to roll the wheels backward if needed.
The low gear also provides downhill control when descending.
The most recent generation of clip-on handcycles is fully electrical wheelchair power add-ons that use lithium-ion battery, brushless DC electric motor and light-weight aluminium frames with easy to attach clamps to convert almost any manual wheelchair into electrical trike in seconds.
That makes long-distance journeys and everyday tasks much easier and keeps wheelchair users hands clean.
There have been significant efforts over the past 20 years to develop stationary wheelchair trainer platforms that could enable wheelchair users to exercise as one would on a treadmill or bicycle trainer.
Some devices have been created that could be used in conjunction with virtual travel and interactive gaming similar to an omnidirectional treadmill.
This convergence of virtual reality and a treadmill have been used for pediatric and adult rehabilitation to regain walking skills.
Recently, EPFL's CNBI project has succeeded in making wheelchairs that can be controlled by brain impulses.
Interest in electric-powered wheelchairs that are able to climb stairs has increased over the past twenty years.
Therefore, many electric wheelchairs with the ability to climb stairs have been developed.
Electric-powered wheelchairs with climbing ability need to be stronger and have greater movement in comparison to an electric-powered wheelchair that cannot climb stairs.
They must also be stable in order to prevent injury to the wheelchair user.
There are currently a number of electric powered wheelchairs that are able to climb stairs available to purchase.
Technical developments are continuing in this area.
Experiments have also been made with unusual variant wheels, like the omniwheel or the mecanum wheel.
These allow for a broader spectrum of movement, but have made no mass-market penetration.
The electric wheelchair shown on the right is fitted with mecanum wheels (sometimes known as Ilon wheels) which give it complete freedom of movement.
It can be driven forwards, backward, sideways, and diagonally, and also turned around on the spot or turned around while moving, all operated from a simple joystick.
Foot propulsion of a manual wheelchair by the occupant is possible for users who have limited hand movement capabilities or simply do not wish to use their hands for propulsion.
Foot propulsion also allows patients to exercise their legs to increase blood flow and limit further disability.
Users who do this commonly may elect to have a lower seat height and no footplate to better suit the wheelchair to their needs.
Wheelbase chairs are powered or manual wheelchairs with especially molded seating systems interfaced with them for users with a more complicated posture.
A molded seating system involves taking a cast of a person's best achievable seated position and then either carving the shape from memory foam or forming a plastic mesh around it.
This seat is then covered, framed, and attached to a wheelbase.
A bariatric wheelchair is one designed to support larger weights; most standard chairs are designed to support no more than 250 lb (113 kg) on average.
Pediatric wheelchairs are another available subset of wheelchairs.
These can address needs such as being able to play on the floor with other children, or cater for children in large hip-spica casts due to problems such as hip dysplasia.
Hemi wheelchairs have lower seats which are designed for easy foot propulsion.
The decreased seat height also allows them to be used by children and shorter individuals.
A knee scooter is a related device with some features of a wheelchair and some walking aids.
Unlike wheelchairs they are only suitable for below knee injuries to a single leg.
The user rests the injured leg on the scooter, grasps the handlebars, and pushes with the uninjured leg.
Some walkers can be used as a wheelchair.
These walkers have seat and foot plates, so an attendant can push while the patient is sitting on the walker.
This is useful for a person who gets tired while walking with a walker, or has a limited walking range meaning the person can walk, but after a while, the person will collapse and fall to the ground.
A commode wheelchair is a wheelchair made for the bathroom.
A commode wheelchair has a hole in the seat so the user does not have to transfer into the toilet.
Sometimes the hole can be covered.
Sometimes there is a pan attached to the hole, so the user can urinate/defecate without having to wheel over the toilet.
Adapting the built environment to make it more accessible to wheelchair users is one of the key campaigns of disability rights movements and local equality legislation such the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
The social model of disability defines 'disability' as the discrimination experienced by people with impairments as a result of the failure of society to provide the adaptions needed for them to participate in society as equals.
This includes both physical adaptions of the built environment and adaption of organizational and social structures and attitudes.
A core principle of access is universal design - that all people regardless of disability are entitled to equal access to all parts of society like public transportation and buildings.
A wheelchair user is less disabled in an environment without stairs.
Access starts outside of the building, with the provision of reduced height kerb-cuts where wheelchair users may need to cross roads, and the provision of adequate wheelchair parking, which must provide extra space in order to allow wheelchair users to transfer directly from seat to chair.
Some tension exists between access provisions for visually impaired pedestrians and wheelchair users and other mobility impaired pedestrians as textured paving, vital for visually impaired people to recognise the edge of features such as light-controlled crossings, is uncomfortable at best, and dangerous at worst, to those with mobility impairments.
For access to public buildings, it is frequently necessary to adapt older buildings with features such as ramps or elevators in order to allow access by wheelchair users and other people with mobility impairments.
Other important adaptations can include powered doors, lowered fixtures such as sinks and water fountains, and accessible toilets with adequate space and grab bars to allow the disabled person to transfer out of their wheelchair onto the fixture.
Access needs for people with other disabilities, for instance visual impairments, may also be required, such as by provision of high visibility markings on the edges of steps and braille labelling.
Increasingly new construction for public use is required by local equality laws to have these features incorporated at the design stage.
The same principles of access that apply to public buildings also apply to private homes and may be required as part of local building regulations.
Important adaptations include external access, providing sufficient space for a wheelchair user to move around the home, doorways that are wide enough for convenient use, access to upper floors, where they exist, which can be provided either by dedicated wheelchair lifts, or in some cases by using a stairlift to transfer between wheelchairs on different floors, and by providing accessible bathrooms with showers and/or bathtubs that are designed for accessibility.
Accessible bathrooms can permit the use of mobile shower chairs or transfer benches to facilitate bathing for people with disabilities.
Wet rooms are bathrooms where the shower floor and bathroom floor are one continuous waterproof surface.
Such floor designs allow a wheelchair user using a dedicated shower chair, or transferring onto a shower seat, to enter the shower without needing to overcome a barrier or lip.
The construction of low floor trams and buses are increasingly required by law, whereas the use of inaccessible features such as paternoster lifts in public buildings without any alternative methods of wheelchair access is increasingly deprecated.
Modern architecture is increasingly required by law and recognised good practise to incorporate better accessibility at the design stage.
In many countries, such as the UK, the owners of inaccessible buildings who have not provided permanent access measures are still required by local equality legislation to provide 'reasonable adjustments' to ensure that disabled people are able to access their services and are not excluded.
These may range from keeping a portable ramp on hand to allow a wheelchair user to cross an inaccessible threshold, to providing personal service to access goods they are not otherwise able to reach.
Public transit vehicles are increasingly required to be accessible to people who use wheelchairs.
In the UK, all single deck buses are required to be accessible to wheelchair users by 2017, all double-deck coaches by 2020.
Similar requirements exist for trains, with most trains already incorporating a number of wheelchair-spaces.
The EU has required airline and airport operators to support the use of airports and airliners by wheelchair users and other 'Persons with Reduced Mobility' since the introduction of EU Directive EC1107/2006.
In Los Angeles there is a program to remove a small amount of seating on some trains to make more room for bicycles and wheelchairs.
New York City's entire bus system is wheelchair-accessible, and a multimillion-dollar renovation program is underway to provide elevator access to many of the city's 485 subway stations.
In Adelaide, Australia, all public transport has provision for at least two wheelchairs per bus, tram or train.
In addition, all trains have space available for bicycles.
The Washington, D.C. Metro system features complete accessibility on all its subways and buses.
In Paris, France, the entire bus network, i.e. 60 lines, has been accessible to wheelchair users since 2010.
In the United States, a wheelchair that has been designed and tested for use as a seat in motor vehicles is often referred to as a "WC19 Wheelchair" or a "transit wheelchair".
ANSI-RESNA WC19 (officially, SECTION 19 ANSI/RESNA WC/VOL.
1 Wheelchairs for use in Motor Vehicles) is a voluntary standard for wheelchairs designed for use when traveling facing forward in a motor vehicle.
ISO 7176/19 is an international transit wheelchair standard that specifies similar design and performance requirements as ANSI/RESNA WC19.
There are special vans equipped for wheelchairs.
These vans are large and have a ramp on a side door or the back door, so a wheelchair can get inside the vehicle while the user is still in it.
Some of the back seats will be removed and replaced with wheelchair security harnesses.
Sometimes wheelchair vans are equipped so the wheelchair user can drive the van without getting out of the wheelchair.
A vehicle can be equipped with hand controls.
Hand controls are used when a person can not move their legs to push the pedals.
The hand controls do the pushing of the pedals.
Some racecar drivers are paralyzed and use hand controls.
Some elements of the outdoor public realm present barriers to wheelchair use, such as grade-separated areas where no ramps are provided.
UK guidance recommends a minimum width of 1.5m for a wheelchair user and an ambulant pedestrian to move side by side; with maximum ramp gradients of 8% for manual wheelchair use (5% is preferred).
Several organizations exist that help to give and receive wheelchair equipment.
Organizations that accept wheelchair equipment donations typically attempt to identify recipients and match them with the donated equipment they have received.
Organizations that accept donations in the form of money for wheelchairs typically have the wheelchairs manufactured and distributed in large numbers, often in developing countries.
Organizations focusing on wheelchairs include Direct Relief, the Free Wheelchair Mission, Hope Haven, Personal Energy Transportation, the Wheelchair Foundation and WheelPower.
In the United Kingdom wheelchairs are supplied and maintained free of charge for non-ambulatory disabled people.
Wheelchair seating systems are designed both to support the user in the sitting position and to redistribute pressure from areas of the body that are at risk of pressure ulcers.
For someone in the sitting position, the parts of the body that are the most at risk for tissue breakdown include the ischial tuberosities, coccyx, sacrum and greater trochanters.
Wheelchair cushions are the prime method of delivering this protection and are nearly universally used.
Wheelchair cushions are also used to provide stability, comfort, aid posture and absorb shock.
Wheelchair cushions range from simple blocks of foam costing a few pounds or dollars, to specifically engineered multilayer designs with costs running into the hundreds of pounds/dollars/euros.
Prior to 1970, little was known about the effectiveness of wheelchair cushions and there was not a clinical method of evaluating wheelchair seat cushions.
Most recently, pressure imaging (or pressure mapping) is used to help determine each individual's pressure distribution to properly determine and fit a seating system.
While almost all wheelchair users will use a wheelchair cushion, some users need more extensive postural support.
This can be provided by adaptions to the back of the wheelchair, which can provide increased rigidity, head/neck rests and lateral support and in some cases by adaptions to the seat such as pommels and knee-blocks.
Harnesses may also be required.
There is a wide range of accessories for wheelchairs.
There are cushions, cup holders, seatbelts, storage bags, lights, and more.
A wheelchair user uses seatbelts for security or posture.
Some wheelchair users want to use a seatbelt to make sure they never fall out of the wheelchair.
Other wheelchair users use a seatbelt because they can not sit up straight on their own.
Wire wheels, wire-spoked wheels, tension-spoked wheels, or "suspension" wheels are wheels whose rims connect to their hubs by wire spokes.
Although these wires are considerably stiffer than a similar diameter wire rope, they function mechanically the same as tensioned flexible wires, keeping the rim true while supporting applied loads.
The term suspension wheel should not be confused with vehicle suspension.
Wire wheels are used on most bicycles and are still used on many motorcycles.
They were invented by aeronautical engineer George Cayley in 1808.
Although Cayley first proposed wire wheels, he did not apply for a patent.
The first patent for wire wheels was issued to Theodore Jones of London, England on October 11, 1826.
Eugène Meyer of Paris, France was the first person to receive, in 1869, a patent for wire wheels on bicycles.
Bicycle wheels were not strong enough for cars  until the development of tangentially spoked wheels.
They rapidly became well established in the bicycle and motor tricycle world but were not common on cars until around 1907.
This was encouraged by the Rudge-Whitworth patented detachable and interchangeable wheels designed by John Pugh.
These wheels owed their resistance to braking and accelerative stresses to their two inner rows of tangential spokes.
An outer row of radial spokes gave lateral strength against cornering stresses.
These wheels were deeply dished so that steering pivot pins might lie as near as possible to the center-line of the tires.
Their second feature was that they were easily detachable  being mounted on splined false hubs.
A process of assembling wire wheels is described as wheelbuilding.
From the earliest days automobiles used either wire wheels or heavy wooden or pressed steel spoked artillery type.
The development of the quick detachable hubs of either Rudge-Whitworth or Riley design did much to popularise wire wheels and incidentally led to the fitting of "spare wheels".
After their wooden spoked artillery wheels proved inadequate many US manufacturers paid John Pugh of Rudge-Whitworth royalties to manufacture wire wheels using his patents.
Artillery wheels fell out of favour in the late 1920s and the development of the cheaper pressed steel wheels by Joseph Sankey replaced wire wheels wherever the premium price of wire wheels was not justified by their weight saving.
Before 1960, sports/racing cars usually had Rudge-Whitworth centerlock wire wheels equipped with splined hubs and a quick-release "knockoff" (central wing nut) locking cap that could be unscrewed by striking a wing of the nut with a special alloy mallet or "knockoff hammer".
Some jurisdictions, including the United States and West Germany, prohibited eared hubcaps for safety reasons in the late 1960s.
In response, some manufacturers (e.g. Maserati) preferred to hold the wheel on the splined hub by capping with a single conventional unwinged hex nut requiring a special large spanner.
In the 1960s, even lighter cast alloy wheels became usual—at first with splined hubs and knock-off caps—and now predominate.
New versions of wire wheels are still made but often with standard hub bolt patterns covered by a center cap to fit without adapters.
At one time, motorcycles used wire wheels built up from separate components, but, except for adventure, enduro or dirtbikes, they are now mainly used for their retro appearance.
The first commercially successful use of wired wheels was on bicycles.
They were introduced early on in the development of the bicycle, following soon after the adoption of solid rubber tires.
This development marked a major improvement over the older wooden wheels, both in terms of weight and comfort (the increased elasticity of the wheel helping to absorb road vibrations).
In England, the engineer William Stanley developed the steel-wired spider wheel in 1849, an improvement over the cumbersome wooden spoked wheels then fitted to the tricycles that his employer was making.
Bicycle manufacturers build millions of wheels annually, using the common crossed-spoke patterns whose crossings of adjacent spokes are governed by the number of spokes in the wheel.
Wheelbuilders of racing teams and in good bicycle shops build wheels to other patterns such as two-cross, one-cross, or no-cross (usually called radial).
Many of these patterns have been used for more than 100 years.
It is claimed that crossed patterns have more strength and stability, and that irregular patterns are art forms and have little structural merit.
In the 1980s, cast wheels with 5 or 6 rigid spokes began to appear in the Olympic Games and in professional racing.
These have advantages in specialized applications, such as time trials, but wire-spoked wheels are used for most purposes.
Typically, each spoke is pretensioned to about 100 pounds of force, on an unloaded wheel.
When the bicycle is loaded with a rider, then the spokes below the hub have less tension.
With every rotation of the wheel, there is repeatedly changes in the spoke tension that can contribute to broken spokes because of fatigue failures.
Fatigue usually causes spokes to fail.
With the proper air pressure, the tire will absorb light bumps and vibrations and roll faster than a hard, inflexible tire at higher air pressures in the 120-130 psig range.
Heavier riders require slightly higher air pressures.
The reaction to a radial load of a well-tensioned wire spoked wheel, such as by a rider sitting on a bicycle, is that the wheel flattens slightly near the ground contact area.
The rest of the wheel remains approximately circular.
The tension of all the spokes does not increase significantly; instead, only the spokes directly under the hub decrease their tension.
The issue of how best to describe this situation is debated.
Some authors conclude from this that the hub "stands" on those spokes immediately below it that experience a reduction in tension, even though the spokes below the hub exert no upward force on the hub and can be replaced by chains without much changing the physics of the wheel.
Other authors conclude that the hub "hangs" from those spokes above it that exert an upward force on the hub, and that have higher tension than the spokes below the hub, which pull down on the hub.
Despite being composed of thin and relatively flexible spokes, wire wheels are radially stiff and provide very little suspension compliance compared to even high-pressure bicycle tires.

The windshield (North American English) or windscreen (Commonwealth English except Canada) of an aircraft, car, bus, motorbike, truck, train, boat or streetcar is the front window, which provides visibility while protecting occupants from the elements.
Modern windshields are generally made of laminated safety glass, a type of treated glass, which consists of, typically, two curved sheets of glass with a plastic layer laminated between them for safety, and bonded into the window frame.
Motorcycle windshields are often made of high-impact polycarbonate or acrylic plastic.
Windshields protect the vehicle's occupants from wind and flying debris such as dust, insects, and rocks, and provide an aerodynamically formed window towards the front.
UV coating may be applied to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation.
However, this is usually unnecessary since most auto windshields are made from laminated safety glass.
The majority of UV-B is absorbed by the glass itself, and any remaining UV-B together with most of the UV-A is absorbed by the PVB bonding layer.
On motorbikes their main function is to shield the rider from wind, though not as completely as in a car, whereas on sports and racing motorcycles the main function is reducing drag when the rider assumes the optimal aerodynamic configuration with their body in unison with the machine and does not shield the rider from wind when sitting upright.
Early windshields were made of ordinary window glass, but that could lead to serious injuries in the event of a crash.
A series of crashes led up to the development of stronger windshields.
The most notable example of this is the Pane vs. Ford case of 1917 that decided against Pane in that he was only injured through reckless driving.
They were replaced with windshields made of toughened glass and were fitted in the frame using a rubber or neoprene seal.
The hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke.
These windshields, however, could shatter from a simple stone chip.
"Triplex" glass laminating, however, had been available for windshields in France from 1911 and in Britain from 1912; it was adopted as an accessory by some high-end American auto manufacturers beginning in 1913, and from 1919 to 1929 Henry Ford ordered the use of laminated glass on all of his vehicles.
Modern, glued-in windshields contribute to the vehicle's rigidity, but the main force for innovation has historically been the need to prevent injury from sharp glass fragments.
Almost all nations now require windshields to stay in one piece even if broken, except if pierced by a strong force.
The urethane sealant is protected from UV in sunlight by a band of dark dots called a frit around the edge of the windshield.
The darkened edge transitions to the clear windshield with smaller dots to minimize thermal stress in manufacturing.
The same band of darkened dots is often expanded around the rearview mirror to act as a sunshade.
On a rainy day, water refraction on aircraft windshields can mislead pilots into believing that they are flying at a higher altitude than they actually are due to the horizon appearing lower than it is.
This can result in undershooting the runway and become a safety hazard.
In many places, laws restrict the use of heavily tinted glass in vehicle windshields; generally, laws specify the maximum level of tint permitted.
Some vehicles have noticeably more tint in the uppermost part of the windshield to block sunglare.
In aircraft windshields, an electric current is applied through a conducting layer of tin(IV) oxide to generate heat to prevent icing.
A similar system for automobile windshields, introduced on Ford vehicles as "Quickclear" in Europe ("InstaClear" in North America) in the 1980s and through the early 1990s, used this conductive metallic coating applied to the inboard side of the outer layer of glass.
Other glass manufacturers utilize a grid of micro-thin wires to conduct the heat especially on the later European Ford Transit vans.
These systems are more typically utilized by European auto manufacturers such as Jaguar and Porsche.
The use of thermal glass prevents some navigation systems from functioning correctly, as the embedded metal blocks the satellite signal.
The RF signal tends to flow along the metal wires or layer so very little radiation can pass.
This can be resolved by using an external antenna.
Mobile telephones can also have problems; thermal glass typically allows only 0.001 (1‰, or one per mille) of the signal to pass, whereas a concrete wall with rebars allows up to 0.100 (10%, or 100‰) of the signal to pass.
The term windshield is used generally throughout North America.
The term windscreen is the usual term in the British Isles and Australasia for all vehicles.
In the US windscreen refers to the mesh or foam placed over a microphone to minimize wind noise, while a windshield refers to the front window of a car.
In the UK, the terms are reversed, although generally, the foam screen is referred to as a microphone shield, and not a windshield.
Sports or racing cars would sometimes have aero screens, which were small semi-circular or rectangular windshields.
These were often mounted in pairs behind a foldable flat windshield.
Aero screens are usually less than 20 cm (8 inches) in height.
They are known as aero screens because they only deflect the wind.
The twin aeroscreen setup (often called Brooklands) was popular among older sports and modern cars in vintage style.
A wiperless windshield is a windshield that uses a mechanism other than wipers to remove snow and rain from the windshield.
The concept car Acura TL features a wiperless windshield using a series of jet nozzles in the cowl to blow pressurized air onto the windshield.
Also several glass manufacturers have experimented with nano type coatings designed to repel external contaminants with varying degrees of success but to date none of these have made it to commercial applications.
Certification of a windshield is necessary to ensure safety.
Different counties have made different set of rule that all windshield manufacturers need to comply under Motor Vehicle Acts.
Some of the most know certifications are US DOT, EU ECE, Chinese CCC, South African SABS and Indian BIS standards.
These certification ensures safety, reliability and quality of a product as per respective legal requirements.
According to the US National Windshield Repair Association, many types of stone damage can be successfully repaired.
Whether the windshield can be repaired always depends upon four factors: the size, type, depth and location of the damage.
Repair of cracks up to 6.1 cm (2.4 inches) is within permissible limits; automobile glass with more severe damage needs to be replaced.
However, this is dependent on local laws.
If a crack extends to the edge of the panel then this would compromise the structural integrity of the windshield.
Aircraft windshields are designed in such a way that even if a crack were to extend all the way across the panel, the structural integrity is maintained via multiple failsafe methods in both frame and the glass plies.
A sacrificial outer layer that cracks rather than devitrifies is the first failsafe.
Circular bullseyes, linear cracks, crack chips, dings, pits and star-shaped breaks can be repaired without removing the glass, eliminating the risk of leaking or bonding problems sometimes associated with replacement.
deep damage on both layers of glass due to solar absorption or oxidation.
In cracked windshield repair, air is removed from the damaged area on the windshield with a specified vacuum injection pump.
Then using the injection pump, the clear adhesive resin is injected to replace the air in the windshield crack.
The resin is then cured with an ultraviolet light.
When done properly, the damaged area’s strength is restored, as is 90–95% of the clarity.
Windshields that cannot be repaired have to be replaced.
Replacement of a windshield typically takes less than an hour.
To ensure the vehicle is safe to drive, time values called the Safe Drive Away Time have been established.
Windshields which have been replaced must cure or bond sufficiently until they are able to withstand the forces of a crash.
Knowing the minimum time needed to cure the glass bonding adhesives is therefore important.
This safe drive away time (SDAT) or minimum drive away time (MDAT) refers to the time required until a windshield installation or glass replacement is considered safe to drive again.
Criteria are specified in U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 212/208 (see FMVSS) to ensure the reliability of adhesive systems.
Typically the SDAT is verified with crash tests as well as with high-speed laboratory test methods.
Consumers may be unaware that the MDAT or SDAT time is focused on safety and not necessarily on the quality, durability, or warranty of the installation.
Care must be taken not to drive the vehicle prior to the SDAT/MDAT.
Airbags deploy at speeds up to 320 km/h (200 mph; 89 m/s) and in some cases exert tremendous force on the windshield.
Occupants can impact the airbag just 50  ms after initial deployment.
Depending on vehicle design, airbag deployment and/or occupant impact into the airbag may increase forces on the windshield, dramatically in some cases.
With the advent of quick-cure adhesives, mobile windshield replacements have become more prevalent.
Often the temperature and humidity cannot be controlled for mobile installations.
For most common glass adhesives the ideal environment is 21 °C (70 °F) and 50% humidity.
Variations from the ideal curing environment can increase the time needed for a sufficiently safe bond to form.
Because of the variables and difficulties involved in mobile windshield replacement, many vehicle manufacturers do not recommend this method of installations.
Waste disposal of laminated glass is no longer permitted in a landfill in most European countries as the End of Life Vehicles Directive (ELV) is implemented.
A study by Surrey University and Pilkington Glass proposes that waste laminated glass be placed into a separating device such as a rolling mill where the glass is fragmented and the larger cullet is mechanically detached from the inner film.
The application of heat then melts the laminating plastic, usually, polyvinyl butyral "PVB" enabling both the glass and the interior film to be recycled.
The PVB recycling process is a simple procedure of melting and reshaping it.
One possible method of recycling of simple automotive laminated windshields could involve heating the windshield to above the melting point of the PVB interlayer and then separating the glass plies.
This depends chiefly on the differential melting points of PVB and glass and is not suitable for other interlayer materials such as silicone based materials.
Wildlife crossings are structures that allow animals to cross human-made barriers safely.
Wildlife crossings may include underpass tunnels or wildlife tunnels, viaducts, and overpasses or green bridges (mainly for large or herd-type animals); amphibian tunnels; fish ladders; canopy bridges (especially for monkeys and squirrels); tunnels and culverts (for small mammals such as otters, hedgehogs, and badgers); and green roofs (for butterflies and birds).
Wildlife crossings are a practice in habitat conservation, allowing connections or reconnections between habitats, combating habitat fragmentation.
They also assist in avoiding collisions between vehicles and animals, which in addition to killing or injuring wildlife may cause injury or death to humans and property damage.
Similar structures can be used for domesticated animals, such as cattle creeps.
Habitat fragmentation occurs when human-made barriers such as roads, railroads, canals, electric power lines, and pipelines penetrate and divide wildlife habitat.
Of these, roads have the most widespread and detrimental effects.
Scientists estimate that the system of roads in the United States affects the ecology of at least one-fifth of the land area of the country.
For many years ecologists and conservationists have documented the adverse relationship between roads and wildlife, and identify four ways that roads and traffic detrimentally affect wildlife populations: (1) they decrease habitat amount and quality, (2) they increase mortality due to wildlife-vehicle collisions (road kill), (3) they prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and (4) they subdivide wildlife populations into smaller and more vulnerable sub-populations (fragmentation).
Habitat fragmentation can lead to extinction or extirpation if a population's gene pool is restricted enough.
The first three effects (loss of habitat, road kill, and isolation from resources) exert pressure on various animal populations by reducing available resources and directly killing individuals in a population.
For instance, found that road kills do not pose a significant threat to healthy populations but can be devastating to small, shrinking, or threatened populations.
Road mortality has significantly affected a number of prominent species in the United States, including white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi), and black bears (Ursus americanus).
In addition, habitat loss can be direct, if habitat is destroyed to make room for a road, or indirect, if habitat quality close to roads is compromised due to emissions from the roads (e.g. noise, light, runoff, pollution, etc.).
Finally, species that are unable to migrate across roads to reach resources such as food, shelter and mates will experience reduced reproductive and survival rates, which can compromise population viability.
In addition to the first three factors, numerous studies have shown that the construction and use of roads is a direct source of habitat fragmentation.
As mentioned above, populations surrounded by roads are less likely to receive immigrants from other habitats and as a result, they suffer from a lack of genetic diversity.
These small populations are particularly vulnerable to extinction due to demographic, genetic, and environmental stochasticity because they do not contain enough alleles to adapt to new selective pressures such as changes in temperature, habitat, and food availability.
The relationship between roads and habitat fragmentation is well documented.
One study found that roads contribute more to fragmentation in forest habitats than clear cuts.
Another study concluded that road fragmentation of formerly contiguous forest in eastern North America is the primary cause for the decline of forest bird species and has also significantly harmed small mammals, insects, and reptiles in the United States.
After years of research, biologists agree that roads and traffic lead to habitat fragmentation, isolation and road kill, all of which combine to significantly compromise the viability of wildlife populations throughout the world.
Wildlife-vehicle collisions have a significant cost for human populations because collisions damage property and injure and kill passengers and drivers.
estimated the number of collisions with ungulates in traffic in Europe at 507,000 per year, resulting in 300 people killed, 30,000 injured, and property damage exceeding $1 billion.
In parallel, 1.5 million traffic accidents involving deer in the United States cause an estimated $1.1 billion in vehicle damage each year.
On a larger scale, research indicates that wildlife-vehicle collisions in the United States result in 29,000 injuries and more than 200 fatalities per year.
The conservation issues associated with roads (wildlife mortality and habitat fragmentation) coupled with the substantial human and economic costs resulting from wildlife-vehicle collisions have caused scientists, engineers, and transportation authorities to consider a number of mitigation tools for reducing the conflict between roads and wildlife.
Of the currently available options, structures known as wildlife crossings have been the most successful at reducing both habitat fragmentation and wildlife-vehicle collisions caused by roads.
Wildlife crossings are structural passages beneath or above roadways that are designed to facilitate safe wildlife movement across roadways.
In recent years, conservation biologists and wildlife managers have advocated wildlife crossings coupled with roadside fencing as a way to increase road permeability and habitat connectivity while decreasing wildlife-vehicle collisions.
Wildlife crossing is the umbrella term encompassing underpasses, overpasses, ecoducts, green bridges, amphibian/small mammal tunnels, and wildlife viaducts (Bank et al. 2002).
All of these structures are designed to provide semi-natural corridors above and below roads so that animals can safely cross without endangering themselves and motorists.
Written reports of rough fish ladders date to 17th-century France, where bundles of branches were used to create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions.
A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill.
In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in Rhode Island, United States, on the Pawtuxet Falls Dam.
As the Industrial Age advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading to the need for effective fish by-passes.
The first overland wildlife crossings were constructed in France during the 1950s.
European countries including the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, and France have been using various crossing structures to reduce the conflict between wildlife and roads for several decades and use a variety of overpasses and underpasses to protect and re-establish wildlife such as: amphibians, badgers, ungulates, invertebrates, and other small mammals.
The Humane Society of the United States reported in 2007 that the more than 600 tunnels installed under major and minor roads in the Netherlands have helped to substantially increase population levels of the endangered European badger.
The longest "ecoduct" overpass, Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo, in the Netherlands, runs 800 meters (2,600 ft) and spans a highway, railway and golf course.
Wildlife crossings are becoming increasingly common in Canada and the United States.
Recognizable wildlife crossings are found in Banff National Park in Alberta, where vegetated overpasses provide safe passage over the Trans-Canada Highway for bears, moose, deer, wolves, elk, and many other species.
The 24 wildlife crossings in Banff were constructed as part of a road improvement project in 1978.
In the United States, thousands of wildlife crossings have been built in the past 30 years, including culverts, bridges, and overpasses.
These have been used to protect mountain goats in Montana, spotted salamanders in Massachusetts, bighorn sheep in Colorado, desert tortoises in California, and endangered Florida panthers in Florida.
The Henry Street salamander tunnels are tunnels under Henry Street in North Amherst, Massachusetts: they help salamanders cross Henry Street to get to vernal pools that the salamanders use for breeding.
The first wildlife crossing in the Canadian province of Ontario was built in 2010, along Ontario Highway 69 between Sudbury and Killarney, as part of the route's ongoing freeway conversion.
The benefits derived from constructing wildlife crossings to extend wildlife migration corridors over and under major roads appear to outweigh the costs of construction and maintenance.
One study estimates that adding wildlife crossings to a road project is a 7–8% increase in the total cost of the project (Bank et al. 2002).
Theoretically, the monetary costs associated with constructing and maintaining wildlife crossings in ecologically important areas are trumped by the benefits associated with protecting wildlife populations, reducing property damage to vehicles, and saving the lives of drivers and passengers by reducing the number of collisions caused by wildlife.
A study completed for the Virginia Department of Transportation estimated that underpasses for wildlife become cost effective, in terms of property damage, when they prevent between 2.6 and 9.2 deer-vehicle collisions per year, depending on the cost of the underpass.
Approximately 300 deer crossed through the underpasses in the year the study took place (Donaldson 2005).
A number of studies have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of wildlife corridors at providing habitat connectivity (by providing viable migration corridors) and reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions.
The effectiveness of these structures appears to be highly site-specific (due to differences in location, structure, species, habitat, etc.)
but crossings have been beneficial to a number of species in a variety of locations.
Banff National Park offers one of the best opportunities to study the effectiveness of wildlife crossings because the park contains a wide variety of species and is bisected by the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH), a large commercial road.
To reduce the effects of the four-lane TCH, 24 wildlife crossings (22 underpasses and two overpasses) were built to ensure habitat connectivity and protect motorists (Clevenger 2007).
In 1996, Parks Canada developed a contract with university researchers to assess the effectiveness of the crossings.
Subsequently, a number of publications have analyzed the crossings' effect on various species and overall wildlife mortality (see Clevenger & Waltho 2000, Clevenger et al. 2001, and Clevenger 2007).
Using a variety of techniques to monitor the crossings over the last 25 years, scientists report that 10 species of large mammals (including deer, elk, black bear, grizzly bear, mountain lion, wolf, moose, and coyote) have used the 24 crossings in Banff a total of 84,000 times as of January 2007 (Clevenger 2007).
The research also identified a "learning curve" such that animals need time to acclimate to the structures before they feel comfortable using them.
For example, grizzly bear crossings increased from seven in 1996 to more than 100 in 2006, although the actual number of individual bears using the structures remained constant over this time at between two and four bears (Parks Canada, unpublished results).
A similar set of observations was made for wolves, with crossings increasing from two to approximately 140 over the same 10-year period.
However, in this case the actual number of wolves in the packs using the crossings increased dramatically, from a low of two up to a high of over 20 individuals.
Clevenger et al.
(2001) reported that the use of wildlife crossings and fencing reduced traffic-induced mortality of large ungulates on the TCH by more than 80 percent.
Recent analysis for carnivores showed results were not as positive however, with bear mortality increasing by an average of 116 percent in direct parallel to an equal doubling of traffic volumes on the highway, clearly showing no effect of fencing to reduce bear mortality (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep).
Research on the crossings in Banff has thus shown mixed value of wildlife crossings depending on the species in question.
Parks Canada is currently planning to build 17 additional crossing structures across the TCH to increase driver safety near the hamlet of Lake Louise.
Lack of effectiveness of standard fencing in reducing bear mortality demonstrates that additional measures such as wire 'T-caps' on the fence may be needed for fencing to mitigate effectively for bears (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep).
Twenty-four wildlife crossings (highway underpasses) and 12 bridges modified for wildlife have been constructed along a 40-mile stretch of Interstate 75 in Collier and Lee Counties in Florida (Scott 2007).
These crossings are specifically designed to target and protect the endangered Florida panther, a subspecies of cougar found in the Southeastern United States.
Scientists estimate that there are only 80–100 Florida panthers alive in the wild, which makes them one of the most endangered large mammals in North America (Foster & Humphrey 1995).
The Florida panther is particularly vulnerable to wildlife-vehicle collisions, which claimed 11 panthers in 2006 and 14 in 2007 (Scott 2007).
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) has used a number of mitigation tools in an effort to protect Florida panthers and the combination of wildlife crossings and fences have proven the most effective (Scott 2007).
As of 2007, no panthers have been killed in areas equipped with continuous fencing and wildlife crossings and the FWC is planning to construct many more crossing structures in the future.
The underpasses on I-75 also appeared to benefit bobcats, deer, and raccoons by significantly reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions along the interstate (Foster & Humphrey 1995).
Wildlife crossings have also been important for protecting biodiversity in several areas of southern California.
In San Bernardino County, biologists have erected fences along State Route 58 to complement underpasses (culverts) that are being used by the threatened desert tortoise.
Tortoise deaths on the highway declined by 93% during the first four years after the introduction of the fences, proving that even makeshift wildlife crossings (storm-drainage culverts in this case) have the ability to increase highway permeability and protect sensitive species (Chilson 2003).
Studies by Haas (2000) and Lyren (2001) report that underpasses in Orange, Riverside, and Los Angeles Counties have drawn significant use from a variety of species including bobcats, coyotes, gray fox, mule deer, and long-tailed weasels.
These results could be extremely important for wildlife conservation efforts in the region's Puente Hills and Chino Hills links, which have been increasingly fragmented by road construction (Haas 2000).
Los Angeles County's first wildlife-purpose built underpass is at Harbor Boulevard.
It was built in partnership between Los Angeles County, California State Parks and the Puente Hills Habitat Preservation Authority.
Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, also known as Liberty Canyon Wildlife Crossing, in Agoura Hills, California, will be one of the largest overpasses in the United States after its stated completion in 2024.
The Netherlands has over 66 wildlife crossings (overpasses and ecoducts) that have been used to protect the endangered European badger, as well as populations of wild boar, red deer, and roe deer.
As of 2012, the Veluwe, 1,000 square kilometers (390 sq mi) of woods, heathland and drifting sands, the largest lowland nature area in North Western Europe, contains nine ecoducts, 50 meters (160 ft) wide on average, that are used to shuttle wildlife across highways that transect the Veluwe.
The first two ecoducts on the Veluwe were built in 1988 across the A50 when the highway was constructed.
Five of the other ecoducts on the Veluwe were built across existing highways, one was built across a two lane provincial road.
The two ecoducts across the A50 were used by nearly 5,000 deer and wild boar during a one-year period (Bank et al. 2002).
The Netherlands also boasts the world's longest ecoduct-wildlife overpass called the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo (sand quarry nature bridge at Crailo) (Danby 2004).
The massive structure, completed in 2006, is 50 meters (160 ft) wide and over 800 meters (2,600 ft) long and spans a railway line, business park, roadway, and sports complex (Danby 2004).
Monitoring is currently underway to examine the effectiveness of this innovative project combining wildlife protection with urban development.
The oldest wildlife passage is Zeist West -
A 28, opened in 1988.
Another case study of the effectiveness of wildlife crossings comes from an underpass built to minimize the ecological effect of the Calder Freeway as it travels through the Black Forest in Victoria, Australia.
In 1997, the Victorian Government Roads Corporation built Slaty Creek wildlife underpass at a cost of $3 million (Abson & Lawrence 2003).
Scientists used 14 different techniques to monitor the underpass for 12 months in order to determine the abundance and diversity of species using the underpass (Abson & Lawrence 2003).
During the 12-month period, 79 species of fauna were detected in the underpass (compared with 116 species detected in the surrounding forest) including amphibians, bats, birds, koalas, wombats, gliders, reptiles, and kangaroos (Abson & Lawrence 2003).
The results indicate that the underpass could be useful to a wide array of species but the authors suggest that Slaty Creek could be improved by enhanced design and maintenance of fencing to minimise road kill along the Calder Freeway and by attempting to exclude introduced predators such as cats and foxes from the area.
In 2005, area environmental groups floated the idea of a wildlife overpass west of Vail Pass.
In 2010, ARC Solutions – an interdisciplinary partnership – initiated the International Wildlife Crossing Infrastructure Design Competition for a wildlife crossing over Interstate 70 in the high country west of Denver, Colorado; designers had to account for challenges unique to the area, including snow and severe weather, high elevation and steep grades, a six-lane roadway, a bike path, and high traffic volumes, as well as multiple species of wildlife, including lynx.
After receiving 36 submissions from nine countries, a jury of international experts in landscape architecture, engineering, architecture, ecology and transportation selected five finalists in November 2010 to further develop their conceptual designs for a wildlife crossing structure.
In January 2011, the team led by HNTB with Michael Van Valkenburgh & Associates (New York) were selected as the winners.
The design features a single 100 m (328 ft) concrete span across the highway that is planted with a variety of vegetation types, including a pine-tree forest and meadow grasses, to attract different species to cross.
A modular precast concrete design means that much of the bridge can be constructed offsite and moved into place.
In late 2020, Summit County Safe Passages released the "I-70 East Vail Pass Wildlife Crossings Feasibility Study" for a wildlife overpass.
In 2005, the Washington State Department of Transportation received approval to begin a 15-mile (24 km) safety improvement project through the Snoqualmie Pass area along the Interstate 90 corridor from Hyak to Easton, through the Central Cascades and Mountains to Sound Greenway National Heritage Area, including a series of wildlife crossings.
Wildlife habitat on either side of I-90 will be reconnected with the installation of new bridges and culverts, protecting both wildlife and the traveling public.
The construction of the wildlife overcrossing began in 2015 and was completed in late 2019.
Work to restore habitat on the wildlife bridge over I-90 has continued throughout 2020, with 90,000 trees and shrubs planted on the overcrossing.
In 2018, the Utah Department of Transportation announced a wildlife crossing over Interstate 80 in Parleys Canyon.
The project was completed in early 2019 and measures 110 meters (350 ft) long by 15 meters (50 ft) wide.
On November 19, 2020, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources released a video showing animals using the overpass.
It is currently the only wildlife overpass in the state, though Utah has more than 50 wildlife underpasses.
On December 11, 2020, the Robert L.B. Tobin Land Bridge opened over Wurzbach Parkway in San Antonio, Texas' Phil Hardberger Park.
The project cost $23 million and is designed for both wildlife and pedestrians.
Construction began on November 26, 2018, originally expected to end in April 2020, and opened in December 2020.
At 58 meters (189 ft) long and 46 meters (150 ft) wide, it was the largest wildlife bridge in the United States when it was constructed.
Many endangered lion-tailed macaques used to be killed while crossing the highway at Puduthotam in Valparai, South India.
Thanks to the efforts of NGOs and the forest department, several canopy bridges were installed, connecting trees on either side of the road.
This helped to lower the numbers of lion-tailed macaques killed in the region.
The Environment Conservation Group had initiated a national mission to increase awareness on the importance of adopting roadkill mitigation methods through their mission PATH traveling more than 17,000 kilometers (11,000 mi) across 22 states.
The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV (Chinese: 五菱宏光MiniEV) is a battery electric city car manufactured by SAIC-GM-Wuling since 2020.
Retail deliveries began in China in July 2020.
As of February 2023, global sales since inception have passed 1.1 million units, and the Mini EV has become the best-selling electric car in China.
The Mini EV can seat four people, and standard features including air conditioning, power windows, stereo system, storage and compartments.
Standard safety features of the Mini EV include anti-lock brakes, tire pressure monitoring sensors, and rear parking sensors.
Early models did not include a driver airbag, but later models such as the Mini EV Macaron include the feature as standard.
Power is produced by an electric motor making a peak 20 kW (27 hp; 27 PS) and 85 N⋅m (63 lb⋅ft) of torque with rear-wheel drive, propelling the car to a stated top speed of 100 km/h (62 mph).
The Mini EV is equipped with a 9.2 kWh battery capable of a NEDC range of 120 km (75 mi) or a 13.8kWh battery capable of a NEDC range of 170 km (110 mi).
Based on the NEDC driving cycle, the estimated energy consumption of the Mini EV is 8,1 kWh/100 km.
A  26.5 kWh model is due for 2022, with 280 kilometres (170 mi) (CLTC) estimated range, an optional more powerful 30 kW (40 hp; 41 PS) motor, and an improved interior.
In 2020, the Mini EV had a price starting at US$4,162, and topped out at US$5,607 for a fully-loaded model, making it China's cheapest electric car.
The car has attracted a cult following in China, with owners frequently modifying their vehicles.
The popularity has been compared to that of kei cars in Japan.
The vehicle has been such a success that it has inspired a number of copycats and competitors, including the Chery QQ Ice Cream, Dongfeng Fengguang Mini EV, Geely Panda Mini EV, and BAW S3.
SAIC-GM-Wuling launched a variant of the regular Mini EV called the Mini EV Macaron in April 2021.
The Macaron is a customized version that is available with three exclusive paint colors and more standard features.
The Macaron is sold as a more premium and personalized variant that features redesigned darkened LED headlights, two-tone alloy wheels and exclusive body colors.
The colors are Avocado Green, Lemon Yellow and White Peach Pink, which are the results of the collaboration of Wuling and Pantone Universe.
The Macaron also receives more safety equipment compared to the previous base trim level, including low-speed pedestrian warning, a reversing camera with rear parking sonar and a driver-side airbag.
The Macaron is equipped with a small electric motor that generates a more powerful 20 kW (27 hp; 27 PS) and 85 N⋅m (63 lb⋅ft) of torque compared to the previously launched base trim while range remains unchanged.
A convertible concept version of the Mini EV called the Mini EV Cabrio with a folding soft top was unveiled during the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show, with the vehicle body design based on the Mini EV Macaron.
The production version vehicle body design is based on Mini EV GameBoy Edition and was launched in September 2022.
In 2021 Lithuanian company Nikrob UAB announced a rebadged version of the Mini EV called the FreZe Nikrob with knock-down assembly in Vilnius, Lithuania.
In 2023, A Turkish company called Rainwoll announced a rebadged version of Wuling Hongguang Mini EV called the Rainwoll RW10.
It is sold in 3 trim levels; Basic, Comfort, and Macaron.
The Mini EV GameBoy Edition was introduced in March 2022.
Its exterior has been completely restyled with larger dimensions, while the power remains to be unchanged and carried over from the standard Mini EV producing 27 hp (20 kW; 27 PS) and 85 N⋅m (63 lb⋅ft) or 40 hp (30 kW; 41 PS) and 110 N⋅m (81 lb⋅ft), mated to a 9.2, 13.9, or 25.5 kWh battery.
With six months in the market, the Mini EV sold 119,255 units in 2020, and ranked as China's and the world's second best selling plug-in car after the Tesla Model 3.
In January 2021, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), the Mini EV topped new energy vehicles sales with 25,778 units, compared to the Tesla Model 3 with 13,843 units sold in China.
The Mini EV listed as the world's top selling plug-in car in January 2021.
The Xtra was an English three-wheel cyclecar launched at the Olympia show in November 1921 and built until 1924 by Xtra Cars, Ltd., of London Road, Chertsey, Surrey.
A very basic machine, it was designed by Cuthbert Clarke and resembled a three-wheeled sidecar in most respects.
The car was powered by a 3.75 hp single-cylinder, two stroke, 270 cc Villiers engine and had a friction drive two-speed transmission, using two cork covered wheels of different sizes, chain driven by the engine.
These wheels ran within a drum which was mounted on the single rear wheel and one would make contact to provide drive at the appropriate ratio.
They were controlled by a lever which could be pushed or pulled to engage drive and had a central neutral position.
There was no reverse gear.
Rear suspension was by a coil spring on the engine frame.
There was no front axle, the wheels were controlled by two transverse leaf springs.
Steering was by rack and pinion.
Braking was on the rear wheel only and used shoes operating on the outside of the transmission drum.
The first Xtra was a single seater (monocar) with a light plywood on ash frame body with an occasional seat behind the driver on top of the engine.
It featured acetylene lighting.
A top speed of above 30 mph (48 km/h) was claimed.
The monocar was joined in November 1922 by a "Sociable" two seater with side by side seats and an option of having an 8 hp, V-twin JAP engine in place of the Villiers.
Xtra went into voluntary liquidation in May 1924 and was finally wound up in July 1926.
It is not known how many cars were made.
A windscreen wiper (Commonwealth English) or windshield wiper (American English) is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, or other debris from a vehicle's front window.
Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and watercraft with a cabin—and some aircraft—are equipped with one or more such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement.
A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, and the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it.
The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used for some vehicles.
The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water, other precipitation, or any other impediments to visibility from its surface.
The speed is usually adjustable on vehicles made after 1969, with several continuous rates and often one or more intermittent settings.
Most personal automobiles use two synchronized radial-type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more pantograph arms.
On some vehicles, a windscreen washer system is also used to improve and expand the function of the wiper(s) to dry or icy conditions.
This system sprays water, or an antifreeze window washer fluid, at the windscreen using several well-positioned nozzles.
This system helps remove dirt or dust from the windscreen when used in concert with the wiper blades.
When antifreeze washer fluid is used, it can help the wipers remove snow or ice.
For these types of winter conditions, some vehicles have additional heaters aimed at the windows, embedded heating wire(s) in the glass, or embedded heating wire(s) in the wiper blade; these defroster systems can melt ice or help to keep snow and ice from building up on the windscreen.
Less frequently, miniature wipers are installed on headlights to ensure they function optimally.
Other early designs for the windscreen wiper are credited to Polish concert pianist Józef Hofmann, and to Mills Munitions, Birmingham, who also claimed to have been the first to patent windscreen wipers in England.
At least three inventors patented windscreen cleaning devices at around the same time in 1903; Mary Anderson, Robert Douglass, and John Apjohn.
In April 1911, a patent for windscreen wipers was registered by Sloan & Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool, England, for Gladstone Adams of Whitley Bay.
American inventor Mary Anderson is popularly credited with devising the first operational windscreen wiper in 1903.
In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a "window cleaning device" for electric cars and other vehicles.
Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of windscreen wipers closely resembles the windscreen wiper found on many early car models.
Anderson had a model of her design manufactured, then filed a patent (US 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the US Patent Office on November 10, 1903.
Irish born inventor James Henry Apjohn (1845–1914) patented an "Apparatus for Cleaning Carriage, Motor Car and other Windows" which was stated to use either brushes or wipers and could be either motor driven or hand driven.
The brushes or wipers were intended to clean either both up and down or in just one direction on a vertical window.
Apjohn's invention had a priority date in the UK of 9 October 1903.
John R. Oishei (1886-1968) formed the Tri-Continental Corporation in 1917.
This company introduced the first windscreen wiper, Rain Rubber, for the slotted, two-piece windscreens found on many of the automobiles of the time.
Today Trico Products is one of the world's largest manufacturers of windscreen wipers.
Bosch has the world's biggest windscreen wiper factory in Tienen, Belgium, which produces 350,000 wiper blades every day.
The first automatic electric wiper arms were patented in 1917 by Charlotte Bridgwood.
Inventor William M. Folberth and his brother, Fred, applied for a patent for an automatic windscreen wiper apparatus in 1919, which was granted in 1921.
It was the first automatic mechanism to be developed by an American,  but the original invention is attributed by others to Hawaiian, Ormand Wall.
Trico later settled a patent dispute with Folberth and purchased Folberth's Cleveland company, the Folberth Auto Specialty Co.
The new vacuum-powered system quickly became standard equipment on automobiles, and the vacuum principle was in use until about 1960.
In the late 1950s, a feature common on modern vehicles first appeared, operating the wipers automatically for two or three passes when the windscreen washer button was pressed, making it unnecessary to manually turn the wipers on as well.
Today, an electronic timer is used, but originally a small vacuum cylinder mechanically linked to a switch provided the delay as the vacuum leaked off.
The inventor of intermittent wipers (non-continuous, now including variable-rate wipers) might have been Raymond Anderson, who, in 1923, proposed an electro-mechanical design.
(US Patent 1,588,399).
In 1958, Oishei et al. filed a patent application describing not only electro-mechanical, but also thermal and hydraulic designs.
(US Patent 2,987,747).
Then, in 1961, John Amos, an engineer for the UK automotive engineering company Lucas Industries, filed the first patent application in the UK for a solid-state electronic design.
(US patent 3,262,042).
In 1963, another form of intermittent wiper was invented by Robert Kearns, an engineering professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.
(United States Patent 3,351,836 – 1964 filing date).
Kearns's design was intended to mimic the function of the human eye, which blinks only once every few seconds.
In 1963, Kearns built his first intermittent wiper system using off-the-shelf electronic components.
The interval between wipes was determined by the rate of current flow into a capacitor; when the charge in the capacitor reached a certain voltage, the capacitor would be discharged, activating one cycle of the wiper motor, and then repeating the process.
Kearns showed his wiper design to the Ford Motor Company and proposed that they manufacture the design.
Ford executives rejected Kearns' proposal at the time, but later offered a similar design as an option on the company's Mercury line, beginning with the 1969 models.
Kearns sued Ford in a multi-year patent dispute that Kearns eventually won in court, inspiring the 2008 feature film Flash of Genius based on a 1993 New Yorker article that covered the legal battle.
In March 1970, French automotive manufacturer Citroën introduced more advanced rain-sensitive intermittent windscreen wipers on its  SM model.
When the intermittent function was selected, the wiper would make one sweep.
If the windscreen was relatively dry, the wiper motor drew high current, which would set the control circuit timer to a long delay for the next wipe.
If the motor drew little current, it indicated that the glass was still wet, and would set the timer to minimize the delay.
Wipers may be powered by a variety of means, although most in use today are powered by an electric motor through a series of mechanical components, typically two 4-bar linkages in series or parallel.
Vehicles with air-operated brakes sometimes use pneumatic wipers, powered by tapping a small amount of pressurized air from the brake system to a small air operated motor mounted on or just above the windscreen.
These wipers are activated by opening a valve which allows pressurized air to enter the motor.
Early wipers were often driven by a vacuum motor powered by manifold vacuum.
This had the drawback that manifold vacuum varies depending on throttle position, and is almost non-existent under wide-open throttle, when the wipers would slow down or even stop.
That problem was overcome somewhat by using a combined fuel/vacuum booster pump.
Some cars, mostly from the 1960s and 1970s, had variable-speed, hydraulically-driven wipers, most notably the '61–'69 Lincoln Continental, '69–'71 Lincoln Continental Mark III (but not all '70 models), and '63–'71 Ford Thunderbird.
These were powered by the same hydraulic pump also used for the power steering mechanism.
On the earlier Citroën 2CV, the windscreen wipers were powered by a purely mechanical system, a cable connected to the transmission; to reduce cost, this cable also powered the speedometer.
The wipers' speed was therefore variable with car speed.
When the car was stationary, the wipers were not powered, but a handle under the speedometer allowed the driver to power them by hand.
Most early wipers used a rubber blade attached to a flat metal base.
But as aerodynamic and styling concerns introduced curved windshields, these proved insufficient.
In 1945, John W. Anderson, founder of Trico rival Anco, filed a patent for a wiper with branched arms to keep the blade pressed uniformly against both curved and flat glass, adaptable to almost any windscreen curvature.
As curved windshields became more popular and widespread, following the debut of the 1947 Studebaker Starlight Coupe, these soon became standard equipment.
While they have been superseded by "beam-type" wipers with bodies made of flexible material, this type still remains the most popular.
Wiper blades are made of natural rubber, EPDM rubber (or ethylene propylene rubber) or a combination of both, as natural rubber performs better in cold weather but EPDM rubber doesn't "set" and resists better to thermal aging, UV, ozone and tearing.
Some manufacturers coat them with graphite.
Most wipers are of the pivot (or radial) type: they are attached to a single arm, which in turn is attached to the motor.
These are commonly found on many cars, trucks, trains, boats, airplanes, etc.
Modern windscreen wipers usually move in parallel (Fig. 1, below).
However, various Mercedes-Benz models and other cars such as the Volkswagen Sharan employ wipers configured to move in opposite directions (Fig. 2), which is mechanically more complex but can avoid leaving a large unwiped corner of the windscreen in front of the front-seat passenger.
A cost benefit to the auto-maker occurs when wipers configured to move in opposite directions do not need to be repositioned for cars exported to right hand drive countries such as the UK and Japan.
Another wiper design (Fig. 6) is pantograph-based, used on many commercial vehicles, especially buses with large windscreens.
Pantograph wipers feature two arms for each blade, with the blade assembly itself supported on a horizontal bar connecting the two arms.
One of the arms is attached to the motor, while the other is on an idle pivot.
The pantograph mechanism, while being more complex, allows the blade to cover more of the windscreen on each wipe.
However, it also usually requires the wiper to be "parked" in the middle of the windscreen, where it may partially obstruct the driver's view when not in use.
A few models of automobile sometimes employ a pantograph arm on the driver's side and a normal arm for the passenger.
The Triumph Stag, Lexus and several US makes employ this method to cover more glass area where the windscreen is quite wide but also very shallow.
The reduced height of the windscreen would need the use of short wiper arms which would not have the reach to the edge of the windscreen.
A simple single-blade setup with a center pivot (Fig. 4) is commonly used on rear windscreens, as well as on the front of some cars.
Mercedes-Benz pioneered a system (Fig. 5) called the "Monoblade", based on cantilevers, in which a single arm extends outward to reach the top corners of the windscreen, and pulls in at the ends and middle of the stroke, sweeping out a somewhat M-shaped path.
This way, a single blade is able to cover more of the windscreen, displacing any residual streaks away from the centre of the windscreen.
Some larger cars in the late '70s and early '80s, especially LH driver American cars, had a pantograph wiper on the driver's side, with a conventional pivot on the passenger side.
Asymmetric wiper arrangements are usually configured to clear more windscreen area on the driver's side, and so are mostly mirrored for left and right-hand-drive vehicles (for example, Fig. 1 vs. Fig 10).
One exception is found on the second generations of the Renault Clio, Twingo and Scénic as well as BMW's E60 5 Series and E63 6 Series, the Peugeot 206 and the Nissan Almera Tino, where the wipers always sweep towards the left.
On right-hand-drive models, a linkage allows the right-hand wiper to move outwards towards the corner of the windscreen and clear more area.
Works similar to Fig. 8 but not a split screen windscreen and rest state is at the bottom of the windscreen facing outwards.
Works similar to Fig.
but one wiper has its resting position up and the other down.
Works similar to Fig. 9, but uses a single wiper.
Works similar to Fig. 6, but uses only one wiper.
Works as would Fig. 1, but uses a large, single pantograph wiper.
Works as would Fig. 6, but the wipers are arranged upside down.
Works as would Fig. 1 or Fig. 10, but the wipers are arranged upside down.
Some vehicles are fitted with wipers (with or without washers) on the back window as well.
Rear-window wipers are typically found on hatchbacks, station wagons / estates, sport utility vehicles, minivans, and other vehicles with more vertically-oriented rear windows that tend to accumulate dust.
First offered in the 1940s, they achieved widespread popularity in the 1970s after their introduction on the Porsche 911 in 1966 and the Volvo 145 in 1969.
In the 1960s, as interest in auto safety grew, engineers began researching various headlamp cleaning systems.
In late 1968, Chevrolet introduced high pressure fluid headlamp washers on a variety of their 1969 models.
In 1970, Saab Automobile introduced headlight wipers across their product range.
These operated on a horizontal reciprocating mechanism, with a single motor.
They were later superseded by a radial spindle action wiper mechanism, with individual motors on each headlamp.
In 1972, headlamp cleaning systems became mandatory in Sweden.
Most windscreen wipers operate together with a windscreen washer; a pump that supplies a mixture of water, alcohol, and detergent (a blend called windscreen washer fluid) from a tank to the windscreen.
The fluid is dispensed through small nozzles mounted on the hood.
Conventional nozzles are usually used, but some designs use a fluidic oscillator to disperse the fluid more effectively.
In warmer climates, water may also work, but it can freeze in colder climates, damaging the pump.
Although automobile antifreeze is chemically similar to windscreen wiper fluid, it should not be used because it can damage paint.
The earliest documented idea for having a windscreen wiper unit hooked up to a windscreen washer fluid reservoir was in 1931, Richland Auto Parts Co, Mansfield, Ohio.
Uruguayan racecar driver and mechanic Héctor Suppici Sedes developed a windscreen washer in the late 1930s.
Since 2012, nozzles are replaced on some cars (Tesla, Volvo XC60 2018-2021, Citroen C4 Cactus) by a system called AquaBlade, developed by the company Valeo.
This system supplies the washing liquid directly from the spoiler element of the wiper blade.
This system suppresses visual disturbances during driving and so reduces the reaction time of the driver in case of incident.
Some larger cars are equipped with hidden wipers (or depressed-park wipers).
When wipers are switched off in standard non-hidden designs, a "parking" mechanism or circuit moves the wipers to the lower extreme of the wiped area near the bottom of the windscreen, but still in sight.
For designs that hide the wipers, the windscreen extends below the rear edge of the bonnet.
The wipers park themselves below the wiping range at the bottom of the windscreen, but out of sight.
Late model vehicles that hide wiper blades under the windscreen need to be placed in a service position in order to lift the wiper blade from the windscreen using the wiper service position.
Some vehicles are now available with automatic or driver-programmable windscreen wipers that detect the presence and amount of rain using a rain sensor.
The sensor automatically adjusts the speed and frequency of the blades according to the amount of rain detected.
These controls usually have a manual override.
Rain-sensing windscreen wipers appeared on various models in the late 20th century, one of the first being the Citroën SM.
As of early 2006, rain-sensing wipers are optional or standard on all Cadillacs and most Volkswagens, and are available on many other mainstream manufacturers.
The rain-sensing wipers system currently employed by most car manufacturers today was originally invented and patented in 1978 by Australian, Raymond J. Noack, see U.S. Patents 4,355,271 and 5,796,106.
The original system automatically operated the wipers, lights and windscreen washers.
A common alternative design used on ships, called a clear view screen, avoids the use of rubber wiper blades.
A round portion of the windscreen has two layers, the outer one of which is spun at high speed to shed water.
High speed aircraft may use bleed air which uses compressed air from the turbine engine to remove water, rather than mechanical wipers, to save weight and drag.
Effectiveness of this method also depends on water-repellent glass treatments similar to Rain-X.
Many jurisdictions have legal requirements that vehicles be equipped with windscreen wipers.
Windscreen wipers may be a required safety item in auto safety inspections.
Some US states have a "wipers on, lights on" rule for cars.
In the 1999 television commercial Synchronicity for the Volkswagen Jetta automobile, windscreen wipers were synchronized with events seen through the car windows, and with the song "Jung at Heart", which was commissioned for the advertising agency Arnold Worldwide and composed by Peter du Charme under the name "Master Cylinder".
Émile Constant Levassor (21 January 1843 – 14 April 1897) was a French engineer and a pioneer of the automobile industry and car racing in France.
Levassor was born in Marolles-en-Hurepoix.
After studying engineering and graduating from École Centrale Paris, he started his career in 1872 in a company that produced wood-working machines, where he met René Panhard.
The company also built gas engines and when, in 1886, a Belgian industrialist Edouard Sarazin got a licence to build Daimler engines he chose Levassor to build them in France.
When Sarazin died in 1887, Levassor married his widow, Louise, and together with Panhard they started building cars.
Levassor, Peugeot and Daimler all met in 1888 at Peugeot's Valentigny Factory to share their knowledge, a summit that led Levassor and Peugeot to cooperate in experimenting with Daimler and Benz engines.
However, Levassor gave more thought to the design and operation of the new car than had Benz, Daimler or Peugeot, all of whom had been more concerned with introducing a successful engine into what was still basically a small carriage.
The Panhard of 1891, with an engine built under Daimler licence, introduced a series of innovations that effectively created the modern car.
Levassor moved the engine from the rear to the front of the car and cooled it via a front-mounted water radiator rather than relying, as had been customary, on natural aspiration, which was often insufficient.
He also introduced a crankshaft to link the engine with the gearing, eschewing the bicycle-style belt drive of previous cars; and he installed a clutch pedal and a gear stick, situated between the seats, to operate the gearbox, thus creating the first modern transmission.
The siting of the engine on the front of the car rather than the rear provided far more room for passengers.
The resultant configuration – unfortunately for Levassor – was soon called the systeme Panhard.
Levassor also took part in motor racing, finishing fifth in Paris to Rouen race in 1894, and arriving first in (but not winning) the Paris–Bordeaux–Paris race the following year (both in his own cars).
In 1896, when taking part in the 1896 Paris–Marseille–Paris race, he was seriously injured in a crash while trying to avoid hitting a dog.
He never recovered from the injury, and died in Paris the following year.
Over-expansion led to receivership in 1927 when it was bought from Vickers Limited by William Morris as a personal investment.
He moved it into his Morris Motors empire just before the Second World War.
After that, Wolseley products were "badge-engineered" Morris cars.
Wolseley went with its sister businesses into BMC, BMH and British Leyland, where its name lapsed in 1975.
Hiram Maxim, inventor of the machine gun that bears his name, and by then a member of the combine Vickers Sons & Maxim, had consulted Herbert Austin at The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company Limited in the late 1890s a number of times in relation to the design of flying machines, which Maxim was developing and constructing.
Maxim made use of a number of suggestions made by Austin in Maxim's activities at his works in Crayford, Kent.
Once the sheep shearing company had decided they would not pursue their automobile interest, an approach was made and agreement quickly reached.
The Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company of Adderley Park Birmingham was incorporated in  March 1901 with a capital of £40,000 by Vickers, Sons and Maxim to manufacture motor cars and machine tools.
The managing director was Herbert Austin.
The cars and the Wolseley name came from Austin's exploratory venture for The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company Limited, run since the early 1890s by the now 33-year-old Austin.
Wolseley's board had decided not to enter the business and Maxim and the Vickers brothers picked it up.
After his five-year contract with The Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company ended Austin founded The Austin Motor Company Limited.
Austin had been searching for other products for WSSMC because sale of sheep-shearing machinery was a highly seasonal trade.
About 1895–96 he became interested in engines and automobiles.
During the winter of 1895–96, working in his own time at nights and weekends, he made his own version of a design by Léon Bollée that he had seen in Paris.
Later he found that another British group had bought the rights and he had to come up with a design of his own, having persuaded the directors of WSSMC to invest in the necessary machinery.
In 1897 Austin's second Wolseley car, the Wolseley Autocar No. 1 was revealed.
It was a three-wheeled design (one front, two rear) featuring independent rear suspension, mid-engine and back to back seating for two adults.
It was not successful and although advertised for sale, none were sold.
The third Wolseley car, the four-wheeled Wolseley "Voiturette" followed in 1899.
A further four-wheeled car was made in 1900.
The 1901 Wolseley Gasoline Carriage featured a steering wheel instead of a tiller.
The first Wolseley cars sold to the public were based on the "Voiturette", but production did not get underway until 1901, by which time the board of WSSMC had lost interest in the nascent motor industry.
Thomas and Albert Vickers, directors of Vickers and Maxim, Britain's largest armaments manufacturer, had much earlier decided to enter the industry at the right moment and, impressed by Austin's achievements at WSSMC, they took on his enterprise.
When Austin's five-year contract officially ended in 1906 they had made more than 1,500 cars.
Wolseley was the largest British motor manufacturer and Austin's reputation was made.
The Wolseley range from 1901 to 1905.
in 1904 Queen Alexandra bought a 5.2-litre 24 hp landaulette with coil ignition, a four-speed gearbox and chain drive.
John Siddeley (1st Baron Kenilworth) founded his Siddeley Autocar Company in 1902 to manufacture cars to Peugeot designs.
He had Peugeot-based demonstration cars at the Crystal Palace in 1903.
By 1905, the company had a dozen models for sale and some of them were built for him at Vickers' Crayford, Kent factory.
During 1905 Wolseley—which then dominated the UK car market—purchased the goodwill and patent rights of his Siddeley Autocar Company business  and appointed Siddeley London sales manager of Herbert Austin's The Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company Limited owned by Vickers, Sons and Maxim.
A few months later Herbert Austin left Wolseley to found his own Austin Motor Company due to  resolute refusal to countenance new vertical engines for his Wolseleys, whatever his directors might wish.
Austin handed in his resignation the year before his contract ended.
and Siddeley was appointed manager of Wolseley in his place and, without authority, added Siddeley to the badge on the Wolseley cars.
Siddeley, on his appointment to Austin's former position, promptly replaced Austin's horizontal engines with the now conventional upright engines.
With him he brought his associate Lionel de Rothschild as a member of the Wolseley board.
Together they gave the business a new lease of life.
At the November 1905 Olympia Motor Show, the first at the former National Agricultural Hall, two small 6 hp and 8 hp cars were still exhibited with horizontal engines but there were also Siddeley's new 15, 18 and 32 hp cars with vertical engines.
This switch to vertical engines brought Wolseley a great deal of publicity and their products soon lost their old-fashioned image.
He resigned from Wolseley in 1909 to go into partnership with H P P Deasy and manage the Deasy Motor Company, also of Coventry.
Ernest Hopwood was appointed managing director in August 1909.
Wolsit Officine Legnanesi Autmobili was incorporated in 1907 by Macchi Brothers and the Bank of Legnano to build Wolseley cars under licence in Legnano, about 18 kilometres north-west of central Milan.
A similar enterprise, Fial, had started there a year earlier but failed in 1908.
Wolsit automobile production ended in 1909, the business continued but made luxury bicycles.
Emilio Bozzi made the Ciclomotore Wolsit from 1910 to 1914.
A team of Wolsit cars competed in motoring events in 1907.
After 1911 the name on the cars was again just Wolseley.
Chetwynd's recommendations soon led to a revival in profits and a rapid expansion of Wolseley's business.
The Adderley Park factory was greatly extended in 1912.
These extensions were opened in 1914 but there was not sufficient space for the new Stellite model which was instead produced and marketed by another Vickers subsidiary, Electric and Ordnance Accessories Company Limited.
Wolseley was not then as specialised in its operations as members of the motor industry were to become.
For other members of the Vickers group they were general engineers and they also handled engineering enquiries directed on to them by other group members.
Wolseley built double-decker buses for the Birmingham Corporation.
They also built many specials such as electric lighting sets and motor boat engines – catalogued sizes were from 12 hp to 250 hp with up to twelve cylinders and complete with gearboxes.
Fire engines too and special War Office vehicles being a subsidiary of a major armaments firm.
As befits a company with tool in its name they built machine tools including turret lathes and horizontal borers though chiefly for their own use or for group members.
Large engines were made to power petrol-electric railcars, such as those used by the North-Eastern Railway Company in 1904, and still larger engines were made for the Delaware and Hudson railroad.
In 1905 they also offered petrol narrow-gauge railway locomotives.
The amazing Brennan mono-rail truck which gave rides at the Japan–British Exhibition at Shepherd's Bush in 1910, used a 20HP engine manufactured by the Wolseley Tool and Motor Car company to power the gyroscopic stabilisation and an 80HP Wolseley engine for the petrol-electric propulsion of the 22 ton vehicle.
While at first Wolseley supplied engines for launches, made for them by Teddington Launch Works, they moved on to small river craft and light coasting boats.
The demand for engines for larger vessels grew.
It was not uncommon for orders to be booked for 70-foot (21 m) yachts, racing launches and ferry boats to carry fifty or more passengers.
These were manufactured by S E Saunders Limited at Cowes, Isle of Wight.
Special engines were made for lifeboats.
In 1906 horizontal engines of sixteen cylinders were designed and constructed for British submarines.
They were designed  to run at a low speed.
High efficiency V8 engines were made for hydroplanes as well as straight eights to run on petrol or paraffin.
Weight was very important and these engines were of advanced design.
The airship Mayfly was fitted with Wolseley engines.
60 hp V8-cylinder, bore and stroke: 3¾ x 5½ inches, displacement 11.7 litres.
Caterpillar tracked tractors were designed and supplied to Robert Falcon Scott for his ill-fated second expedition to the Antarctic.
Orders were also received for use by the Deutsche Antarktische Expedition.
In 1914 Wolseley produced a two-wheeled gyroscopically balanced car for the Russian lawyer and inventor Count Peter Schilowsky.
This resembled a huge motorcycle surmounted by a car body, but with the ability to balance when stationary due to the gyroscopic stabilisation mechanism.
It made a number of demonstration runs, but unfortunately with the onset of war it was put to one side.
It was discovered again in 1938 when workmen uncovered its well preserved remains in the Ward End property of Wolseley.
It was then transferred into the Wolseley Museum.
From 1912 lorries and other commercial vehicles were supplied.
Until the outbreak of war in 1914 Wolseley offered six types of commercial vehicle from 12 cwt delivery van to a five-ton lorry with a 40 hp engine.
By 1913 Wolseley was Britain's largest car manufacturer selling 3,000 cars.
The company was renamed Wolseley Motors Limited in 1914.
It also began operations in Montreal and Toronto as Wolseley Motors Limited.
This became British and American Motors after the First World War.
In January 1914 the chairman, Sir Vincent Caillard, told shareholders  they owned probably the largest motor-car producing company in the country and that its factory floor space now exceeded 17 acres.
The Scottish Horse Mounted Brigade's Field Ambulance developed an operating car, designed by Colonel H. Wade in 1914, which enclosed an operating table, sterilisers, full kit of instruments and surgical equipment, wire netting, rope, axes and electric lighting in a Wolseley car chassis.
This operating car was employed during the Gallipoli Campaign at Suvla, in the Libyan Desert (during the Senussi Campaign) and at Kantara in Egypt, before being attached to the Desert Mounted Corps Operating Unit in 1917.
Subsequently, taking part in the Southern Palestine Offensive, which culminated in the Capture of Jerusalem.
In 1918, Wolseley began a joint venture in Tokyo, with Ishikawajiama Ship Building and Engineering.
The first Japanese-built Wolseley car rolled off the line in 1922.
After World War II the Japan venture was reorganized, renaming itself Isuzu Motors in 1949.
Examples of all these models were exhibited at the Olympia Show in November 1919.
The design of the 10 hp and 15 hp engines closely followed their wartime Hispano aero engine using an overhead camshaft.
The public considered the 15 hp was too innovative and a new "14 hp" car using the same engine was hastily created to fill the gap.
Wolseley duly took over the Ward End, Birmingham munitions factory from Vickers in 1919 and purchased a site for a new showroom and offices in London's Piccadilly by the Ritz Hotel.
Over £250,000 was spent on the magnificent new building, Wolseley House.
This was more than double their profits for 1919, when rewarding government contracts were still running.
Those contracts ended.
The government then brought in a special tax on "excess wartime profits".
There was a moulders' strike from December 1919 to April 1920, but in spite of that it was decided to continue the manufacture of other parts.
Then a short, sharp general trade slump peaked in July 1920 and almost every order Wolseley had on its books was cancelled.
In 1920 Wolseley had reported a loss of £83,000.
The following years showed even greater losses.
Next, in October 1922, W R Morris startled the whole motor industry by a substantial reduction in the price of his cars.
In 1924, Wolseley's annual loss would reach £364,000.
Ernest Hopwood had been appointed Managing Director in August 1909 following Siddeley's departure.
He had resigned late in 1919 due to ill-health.
A J McCormack who had been joint MD with Hopwood since 1911 resigned in November 1923 and was replaced by a committee of management.
Then, at the end of October 1926, it was disclosed the company was bankrupt "to the tune of £2 million" and Sir Gilbert Garnsey and T W Horton had been appointed joint receivers and managers.
It was described as "one of the most spectacular failures in the early history of the motor industry".
When Wolseley was auctioned by the receivers in February 1927 it was purchased by William Morris, later Viscount Nuffield for £730,000 using his own money.
Possibly Morris acted to stop General Motors who subsequently bought Vauxhall.
Other bidders beside General Motors included the Austin Motor Company.
Herbert Austin, Wolseley's founder, was said to have been very distressed that he was unable to buy it.
Morris had bought an early taxicab; another Wolseley link with Morris was that his Morris Garages were Wolseley agents in Oxford.
Morris had unsuccessfully tried to produce a 6-cylinder car.
He still wanted his range to include a light six-cylinder car.
Wolseley's 2-litre six-cylinder 16–45, their latest development of their postwar Fifteen, "made a deep impression on him".
Morris incorporated a new company, Wolseley Motors (1927) Limited, he was later permitted to remove the (1927), and consolidated its production at the sprawling Ward End Works in Birmingham.
He sold off large unwanted portions of Wolseley's Adderley Park plant with all his own Soho, Birmingham works and moved Morris Commercial Cars from Soho to the remainder of Adderley Park.
In 1919 Vickers had decided Wolseley should build relatively cheap cars in large quantity – as it turned out – not the right policy.
Morris changed this policy before the Wolseley brand might have lost all its luxury reputation.
After lengthy deliberation and re-tooling of the works he kept the 2-litre six-cylinder 16–45 Silent Six and introduced a four-cylinder version calling it 12–32.
Then an eight-cylinder car was brought to market named 21–60.
In September 1928 a six-cylinder 21–60 was announced primarily aimed at the export market and named Wolseley Messenger there.
It remained in production until 1935.
The Messenger was noted for its robust construction.
A very deep section frame reached the full width of the body – incidentally providing the sill between running boards and body.
The body itself was all-steel and its prototype was first in UK to have its whole side pressed in one.
Wolseley's postwar engines were all of the single overhead-camshaft type, the camshaft driven by a vertical shaft from the crankshaft.
The eight-cylinder 21–60 held the vertical shaft in the centre of the engine, and both crankshaft and camshaft were divided at their midpoints.
Their smallest engine of 847cc was designed and made for Morris's new Minor at Ward End with the camshaft drive's shaft the spindle of the dynamo driven by spiral bevel gears.
But it was relatively expensive to build and inclined to oil leaks, so its design was modified to a conventional side-valve layout by Morris Engines, which was put into production just for Morris cars in 1932.
Meanwhile, Wolseley expanded their original design from four to six cylinders.
That six-cylinder single OHC engine announced in September 1930 powered the Wolseley Hornet and several famous MG models.
This tiny 6-cylinder SOHC engine eventually was made in three different sizes and its camshaft drive continued to evolve from the dynamo's spindle to, in the end, an automatically tensioned single roller chain.
Morris transferred his personal ownership of Wolseley to Morris Motors Limited as of 1 July 1935 and shortly all Wolseley models were badge-engineered Morris designs.
After the war Wolseley left Adderley Park, Morris and Wolseley production was consolidated at Cowley.
The first post-war Wolseleys, the similar 4/50 and 6/80 models used overhead camshaft Wolseley engines, were otherwise based on the Morris Oxford MO and Morris Six MS but given the traditional Wolseley radiator grille.
The Wolseley 6/80 was the flagship of the company and incorporated the best styling and features.
The Wolseley engine of the 6/80 was also superior to the Morris delivering a higher BHP.
The car was well balanced and demonstrated excellent road holding for its time.
The British police used these as their squad cars well into the late sixties.
Following the merger of Austin and Morris that created the British Motor Corporation (BMC), Wolseleys shared with MG and Riley common bodies and chassis, namely the 4/44 (later 15/50) and 6/90, which were closely related to the MG Magnette ZA/ZB and the Riley Pathfinder/Two-point-Six respectively.
In 1957 the Wolseley 1500 was based on the planned successor to the Morris Minor, sharing a bodyshell with the Riley One-Point-Five.
The next year, the Wolseley 15/60 debuted the new mid-sized BMC saloon design penned by Pinin Farina.
It was followed by similar vehicles from five marques within the year.
The Wolseley Hornet was based on the Austin and Morris Mini with a booted body style which was shared with Riley as the Elf.
The 1500 was replaced with the Wolseley 1100 (BMC ADO16) in 1965, which became the Wolseley 1300 two years later.
Finally, a version of the Austin 1800 was launched in 1967 as the Wolseley 18/85.
After the merger of BMC and Leyland to form British Leyland in 1969 the Riley marque, long overlapping with Wolseley, was retired.
Wolseley continued in diminished form with the Wolseley Six of 1972, a variant of the Austin 2200, a six-cylinder version of the Austin 1800.
It was finally killed off just three years later in favour of the Wolseley variant of the wedge-shaped 18–22 series saloon, which was never even given an individual model name, being badged just "Wolseley", and sold only for seven months until that range was renamed as the Princess.
This change thus spelled the end of the Wolseley marque after 74 years.
As of 2012 the Wolseley marque is owned by SAIC Motor, having been acquired by its subsidiary Nanjing Automobile following the break-up of the MG Rover Group.
The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machinery Company continued trading and is now Ferguson plc.
Wolseley often used a two-number system of model names.
Until 1948, the first number was engine size in units of taxable horsepower as defined by the Royal Automobile Club.
Thus, the 14/60 was rated at 14 hp (RAC) for tax purposes but actually produced 60 hp (45 kW).
Later, the first number equalled the number of cylinders.
After 1956, this number was changed to reflect the engine's displacement for four-cylinder cars.
Therefore, the seminal 15/60 was a 1.5-litre engine capable of producing 60 hp (45 kW).
Eventually, the entire naming system was abandoned.
Wolseley also produced a number of aircraft engine designs, although there were no major design wins.
Wolseley Aero Engines Ltd. was a subsidiary formed around 1931 to design aero engines.
When Wolseley Motors Limited was transferred to Morris Motors Limited on 1 July 1935 this part of its business was set aside by William Morris, Lord Nuffield  and put in the ownership of a newly incorporated company, Wolseley Aero Engines Ltd, and remained his personal property.
By 1942 the name of that company had become Nuffield Mechanizations Limited.
They were developing an advanced Wolseley radial aero engine of about 250 horsepower, but the project was abandoned in September 1936 when Nuffield got the fixed price I.T.P. (Intention to Proceed) contract papers (which would have required an army of chartered accountants) and decided to deal only with the War Office and Admiralty, not the Air Ministry (see Airspeed).
World War II or the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a global conflict between two alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers.
Nearly all of the world's countries—including all the great powers—participated, and many invested all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities in pursuit of total war, blurring the distinction between military and civilian resources.
Tanks and aircraft played major roles, with the latter enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.
World War II was the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70 to 85 million fatalities, more than half of which were civilians.
Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust of European Jews, and by massacres, starvation, and disease.
Following the Allied powers' victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.
The causes of World War II included unresolved tensions in the aftermath of World War I and the rises of fascism in Europe and militarism in Japan, and it was preceded by events including the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, Spanish Civil War, outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and German annexations of Austria and the Sudetenland.
World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland.
The United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.
Under their Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out "spheres of influence" across Eastern Europe; in 1940, the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and parts of Finland and Romania.
After the fall of France in June 1940, the war continued primarily between Germany and the British Empire, with campaigns in North and East Africa and the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain and the Blitz of the UK, and the naval Battle of the Atlantic.
By mid-1941, through a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany occupied or controlled much of continental Europe and had formed the Axis alliance with Italy, Japan, and other countries.
In June 1941, Germany led the European Axis in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front.
Japan aimed to dominate East Asia and the Asia-Pacific, and by 1937 was at war with the Republic of China.
In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories in Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on Pearl Harbor, which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom declaring war against Japan.
The European Axis powers declared war on the US in solidarity.
Japan soon conquered much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after its defeat in the naval Battle of Midway; Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union.
Key setbacks in 1943—including German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts.
In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France at Normandy, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies westward.
In 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.
The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories; the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; Hitler's suicide; and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945.
Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, the US dropped the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August.
Faced with imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of more atomic bombings, and the Soviet declaration of war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its unconditional surrender on 15 August and signed a surrender document on 2 September 1945, marking the end of the conflict.
World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world, and it set the foundation for the international order for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century.
The United Nations was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the permanent members of its security council.
The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War.
In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia.
Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.
World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland and the United Kingdom and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939.
Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937, or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria, on 19 September 1931.
Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941.
Other theorised starting dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.
The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939.
Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War II.
The exact date of the war's end also is not universally agreed upon.
It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia.
A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951.
A 1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved most post–World War II issues.
No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed, although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.
World War I had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union.
Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires.
To prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was established in 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference.
The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military, and naval disarmament, as well as settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.
Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I, irredentist and revanchist nationalism had emerged in several European states.
These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the Treaty of Versailles.
Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.
The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918–1919, and a democratic government, later known as the Weimar Republic, was created.
The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left.
Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement.
From 1922 to 1925, the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing, and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a "New Roman Empire".
Adolf Hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933 when Paul von Hindenburg and the Reichstag appointed him.
Following Hindenburg's death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself Führer of Germany and abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign.
France, seeking to secure its alliance with Italy, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession.
The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.
The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards military globalisation; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions.
The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France.
Before taking effect, though, the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.
The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year.
Hitler defied the Versailles and Locarno Treaties by remilitarising the Rhineland in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to the policy of appeasement.
In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Rome–Berlin Axis.
A month later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy joined the following year.
The Kuomintang (KMT) party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies and new regional warlords.
In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, staged the Mukden incident as a pretext to invade Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.
China appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.
Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria.
The two nations then fought several battles, in Shanghai, Rehe and Hebei, until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933.
Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan.
After the 1936 Xi'an Incident, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose Japan.
The Second Italo-Ethiopian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936.
The war began with the invasion of the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia) by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia), which was launched from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea.
The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve peace.
Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did little when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's Covenant.
The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.
Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing Austria.
When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the Nationalist rebels, led by General Francisco Franco.
Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis: Mussolini sent more than 70,000 ground troops, 6,000 aviation personnel, and 720 aircraft to Spain.
The Soviet Union supported the existing government of the Spanish Republic.
More than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the International Brigades, also fought against the Nationalists.
Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics.
The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II but generally favoured the Axis.
His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the Eastern Front.
In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Peking after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge incident, which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.
The Soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with China to lend materiel support, effectively ending China's prior cooperation with Germany.
From September to November, the Japanese attacked Taiyuan, engaged the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou, and fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan.
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell.
The Japanese continued to push Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937.
After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese.
In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at Taierzhuang, but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by the Japanese in May.
In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, but the city was taken by October.
Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.
In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia.
The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time.
This policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets.
Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States and the Western Allies.
In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive.
In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from other European powers.
Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population.
Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.
Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary, and Poland annexed the Trans-Olza region of Czechoslovakia.
Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation.
In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy.
In March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German client state, the Slovak Republic.
Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to Lithuania on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the Klaipėda Region, formerly the German Memelland.
Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City of Danzig, the United Kingdom and France guaranteed their support for Polish independence; when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to the Kingdoms of Romania and Greece.
Shortly after the Franco-British pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel.
Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany and renounced the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish declaration of non-aggression.
The situation became a crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border.
On 23 August the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany, after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom, and Soviet Union had stalled.
This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet "spheres of influence" (western Poland and Lithuania for Germany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence.
The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I.
Immediately afterwards, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.
In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which served as a pretext to worsen relations.
On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German minority would vote on secession.
The Poles refused to comply with the German demands, and on the night of 30–31 August in a confrontational meeting with the British ambassador Nevile Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion.
The first German attack of the war came against the Polish defenses at Westerplatte.
The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany.
followed by Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada.
During the Phoney War period, the alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a cautious French probe into the Saarland.
The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.
Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.
On 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of Warsaw.
The Polish counter-offensive to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the Wehrmacht.
Remnants of the Polish army broke through to besieged Warsaw.
On 17 September 1939, two days after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviet Union invaded Poland under the supposed pretext that the Polish state had ceased to exist.
On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison surrendered to the Germans, and the last large operational unit of the Polish Army surrendered on 6 October.
Despite the military defeat, Poland never surrendered; instead, it formed the Polish government-in-exile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied Poland.
A significant part of Polish military personnel evacuated to Romania and Latvia; many of them later fought against the Axis in other theatres of the war.
Germany annexed western Poland and occupied central Poland; the Soviet Union annexed eastern Poland; small shares of Polish territory were transferred to Lithuania and Slovakia.
On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union.
The proposal was rejected and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France, which was postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather.
After the outbreak of war in Poland, Stalin threatened Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania with military invasion, forcing the three Baltic countries to sign pacts allowing the creation of Soviet military bases in these countries; in October 1939, significant Soviet military contingents were moved there.
Finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939, and was subsequently expelled from the League of Nations for this crime of aggression.
Despite overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet military success during the Winter War was modest, and the Finno-Soviet war ended in March 1940 with some Finnish concessions of territory.
In June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the entire territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as the Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region.
In August 1940, Hitler imposed the Second Vienna Award on Romania which led to the transfer of Northern Transylvania to Hungary.
In September 1940, Bulgaria demanded Southern Dobruja from Romania with German and Italian support, leading to the Treaty of Craiova.
The loss of one-third of Romania's 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II, turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal Ion Antonescu, with a course set towards the Axis in the hopes of a German guarantee.
Meanwhile, German-Soviet political relations and economic co-operation gradually stalled, and both states began preparations for war.
In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies were attempting to cut off.
Denmark capitulated after six hours, and despite Allied support, Norway was conquered within two months.
British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the resignation of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who was replaced by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.
On the same day, Germany launched an offensive against France.
To circumvent the strong Maginot Line fortifications on the Franco-German border, Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.
The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the Ardennes region, which was mistakenly perceived by the Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.
By successfully implementing new Blitzkrieg tactics, the Wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the Allied armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille.
The United Kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of Allied troops from the continent by early June, although they had to abandon almost all their equipment.
On 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom.
The Germans turned south against the weakened French army, and Paris fell to them on 14 June.
Eight days later France signed an armistice with Germany; it was divided into German and Italian occupation zones, and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany.
France kept its fleet, which the United Kingdom attacked on 3 July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany.
The air Battle of Britain began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours.
The United Kingdom rejected Hitler's peace offer, and the German air superiority campaign started in August but failed to defeat RAF Fighter Command, forcing the indefinite postponement of the proposed German invasion of Britain.
The German strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on London and other cities in the Blitz, but largely ended in May 1941 after failing to significantly disrupt the British war effort.
Using newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British shipping in the Atlantic.
The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck.
In November 1939, the United States was assisting China and the Western Allies, and had amended the Neutrality Act to allow "cash and carry" purchases by the Allies.
In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased.
In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases.
Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941.
In December 1940, Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an "arsenal of democracy" and promoting Lend-Lease programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the British war effort; Lend-Lease was later extended to the other Allies, including the Soviet Union after it was invaded by Germany.
The United States started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany.
At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy, and Germany as the Axis powers.
The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country—with the exception of the Soviet Union—that attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.
The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania joined.
Romania and Hungary later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the Soviet Union.
In early June 1940, the Italian Regia Aeronautica attacked and besieged Malta, a British possession.
From late summer to early autumn, Italy conquered British Somaliland and made an incursion into British-held Egypt.
In October, Italy attacked Greece, but the attack was repulsed with heavy Italian casualties; the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes.
To assist Italy and prevent Britain from gaining a foothold, Germany prepared to invade the Balkans, which would threaten Romanian oil fields and strike against British dominance of the Mediterranean.
In December 1940, British Empire forces began counter-offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa.
The offensives were successful; by early February 1941, Italy had lost control of eastern Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner.
The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission after a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan.
Italian defeats prompted Germany to deploy an expeditionary force to North Africa; at the end of March 1941, Rommel's Afrika Korps launched an offensive which drove back Commonwealth forces.
In less than a month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and besieged the port of Tobruk.
By late March 1941, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact; however, the Yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by pro-British nationalists.
Germany and Italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both Yugoslavia and Greece, commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month.
The airborne invasion of the Greek island of Crete at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans.
Partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, which continued until the end of the war.
In the Middle East in May, Commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria.
Between June and July, British-led forces invaded and occupied the French possessions of Syria and Lebanon, assisted by the Free French.
With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations for war.
With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany, and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.
By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.
Hitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.
On 31 July 1940, Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of Ukraine, the Baltic states and Byelorussia.
However, other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a Euro-Asian bloc against the British Empire by inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact.
In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the pact.
The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable.
On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.
On 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them; they were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.
The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line—from the Caspian to the White Seas.
Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population, and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.
Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war, Operation Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt strategic defence.
During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel.
By mid-August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.
The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially-developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov).
The diversion of three-quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy.
In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany and in August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter, which outlined British and American goals for the post-war world.
In late August the British and Soviets invaded neutral Iran to secure the Persian Corridor, Iran's oil fields, and preempt any Axis advances through Iran toward the Baku oil fields or India.
By October, Axis powers had achieved operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region, with only the sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing.
A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend the offensive.
Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential.
The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended.
By early December, freshly mobilised reserves allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.
This, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army, allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100–250 kilometres (62–155 mi) west.
Following the Japanese false flag Mukden incident in 1931, the Japanese shelling of the American gunboat USS Panay in 1937, and the 1937–1938 Nanjing Massacre, Japanese-American relations deteriorated.
In 1939, the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions—the Export Control Acts—which banned U.S. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan, and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime.
During 1939 Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, but was repulsed by late September.
Despite several offensives by both sides, by 1940 the war between China and Japan was at a stalemate.
To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina in September 1940.
Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940.
In August, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.
Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation.
In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during Battle of Shanggao.
In September, Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.
German successes in Europe prompted Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia.
The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan with oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.
In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East.
The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo.
At the same time, Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East, intending to take advantage of the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.
Since early 1941, the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China.
During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.
At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.
Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any "neighboring countries".
Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American–British–Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war.
Emperor Hirohito, after initial hesitation about Japan's chances of victory, began to favour Japan's entry into the war.
As a result, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned.
Hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni in his place, choosing War Minister Hideki Tojo instead.
On 3 November, Nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on Pearl Harbor to the Emperor.
On 5 November, Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war.
On 20 November, the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer.
It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan.
In exchange, Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.
The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.
That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force; the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.
Japan planned to seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific.
The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.
To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.
On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific.
These included an attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, as well as invasions of Guam, Wake Island, Malaya, Thailand, and Hong Kong.
These attacks led the United States, United Kingdom, China, Australia, and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.
Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.
On 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations, thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the Axis powers.
During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue.
All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective.
The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France.
The Soviets demanded a second front.
The British argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolstering resistance forces; Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign.
An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour, without using large-scale armies.
Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.
At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies.
The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.
Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland, and to invade France in 1944.
By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.
Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and U.S. forces, the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.
On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.
Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea, Java Sea, and Indian Ocean, and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia.
In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha.
These easy victories over the unprepared U.S. and European opponents left Japan overconfident, and overextended.
In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia.
The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea.
Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.
In mid-May, Japan started the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.
In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans had broken Japanese naval codes in late May and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy.
With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan attempted to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua.
The Americans planned a counterattack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands, primarily Guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing Rabaul, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.
Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna–Gona.
Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal.
By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.
In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations.
The first was a disastrous offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942 that forced a retreat back to India by May 1943.
The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese frontlines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.
Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.
In May, the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov, and then in June 1942 launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy the Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front.
The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River.
The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.
By mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting.
The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad, and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously.
By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive.
In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk.
Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast.
By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive in North Africa, Operation Crusader, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made.
The Germans also launched a North African offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala line by early February, followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives.
Concerns that the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942.
An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein.
On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the failed Dieppe Raid, demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.
In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta.
A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya.
This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, which resulted in the region joining the Allies.
Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France; although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces.
Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943.
In June 1943, the British and Americans began a strategic bombing campaign against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and "de-house" the civilian population.
The firebombing of Hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.
After the Guadalcanal campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific.
In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians.
Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.
By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands.
In April, the Allies launched an operation to retake Western New Guinea.
In the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia.
On 5 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge.
Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' well-constructed defences, and for the first time in the war, Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.
This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month.
On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives, thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east.
The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority, giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.
The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and the Lower Dnieper Offensive.
On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland, following Italy's armistice with the Allies and the ensuing German occupation of Italy.
Germany, with the help of fascists, responded to the armistice by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas, and creating a series of defensive lines.
German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic, causing an Italian civil war.
The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.
German operations in the Atlantic also suffered.
By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign.
In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran.
The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.
From November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese awaited allied relief as they forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition.
In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio.
On 27 January 1944, Soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, thereby ending the most lethal siege in history.
The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence.
This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region.
By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops.
The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, Rome was captured on 4 June.
The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia.
In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against Allied positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima.
In May 1944, British and Indian forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.
The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.
By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha.
On 6 June 1944 (commonly known as D-Day), after three years of Soviet pressure, the Western Allies invaded northern France.
After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France.
These landings were successful and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France.
Paris was liberated on 25 August by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces, both led by General Charles de Gaulle, and the Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe during the latter part of the year.
An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed.
After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross the Rur river.
In Italy, the Allied advance slowed due to the last major German defensive line.
On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus ("Operation Bagration") that nearly destroyed the German Army Group Centre.
Soon after that, another Soviet strategic offensive forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland.
The Soviets formed the Polish Committee of National Liberation to control territory in Poland and combat the Polish Armia Krajowa; the Soviet Red Army remained in the Praga district on the other side of the Vistula and watched passively as the Germans quelled the Warsaw Uprising initiated by the Armia Krajowa.
The national uprising in Slovakia was also quelled by the Germans.
The Soviet Red Army's strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful coup d'état in Romania and in Bulgaria, followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.
In September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.
By this point, the communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south.
In northern Serbia, the Soviet Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October.
A few days later, the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945.
Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, although Finland was forced to fight their former German allies.
By the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam, pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River while the Chinese captured Myitkyina.
In September 1944, Chinese forces captured Mount Song and reopened the Burma Road.
In China, the Japanese had more successes, having finally captured Changsha in mid-June and the city of Hengyang by early August.
Soon after, they invaded the province of Guangxi, winning major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the end of November and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by mid-December.
In the Pacific, U.S. forces continued to push back the Japanese perimeter.
In mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.
These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands.
In late October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.
On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt to split the Allies on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French-German border, hoping to encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port at Antwerp.
By 16 January 1945, this offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.
In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line.
In mid-January 1945, the Red Army attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia.
On 4 February Soviet, British, and U.S. leaders met for the Yalta Conference.
They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan.
In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while the Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river.
By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B.
In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and retake Budapest, Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet troops near Lake Balaton.
Within two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to Vienna, and captured the city.
In early April, Soviet troops captured Königsberg, while the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg.
American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April, leaving unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin.
Soviet troops stormed and captured Berlin in late April.
In Italy, German forces surrendered on 29 April, while the Italian Social Republic capitulated two days later.
On 30 April, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.
Major changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period.
On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice president, Harry S. Truman.
Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.
On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in his headquarters, and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz (as President of the Reich) and Joseph Goebbels (as Chancellor of the Reich); Goebbels also committed suicide on the following day and was replaced by Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, in what would later be known as the Flensburg Government.
Total and unconditional surrender in Europe was signed on 7 and 8 May, to be effective by the end of 8 May.
German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May.
On 23 May all remaining members of the German government were arrested by the Allied Forces in Flensburg, while on 5 June all German political and military institutions were transferred under the control of the Allies through the Berlin Declaration.
In the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of the Philippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines, clearing Leyte by the end of April 1945.
They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and recaptured Manila in March.
Fighting continued on Luzon, Mindanao, and other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war.
Meanwhile, the United States Army Air Forces launched a massive firebombing campaign of strategic cities in Japan in an effort to destroy Japanese war industry and civilian morale.
A devastating bombing raid on Tokyo of 9–10 March was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history.
In May 1945, Australian troops landed in Borneo, overrunning the oilfields there.
British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March, and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May.
Chinese forces started a counterattack in the Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945.
American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa by the end of June.
At the same time, a naval blockade by submarines was strangling Japan's economy and drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces.
On 11 July, Allied leaders met in Potsdam, Germany.
They confirmed earlier agreements about Germany, and the American, British and Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of Japan, specifically stating that "the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction".
During this conference, the United Kingdom held its general election, and Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as Prime Minister.
The call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the Japanese government, which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms.
In early August, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, declared war on Japan, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting force.
These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms.
The Red Army also captured the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands.
On the night of 9–10 August 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced his decision to accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the Potsdam Declaration.
On 15 August, the Emperor communicated this decision to the Japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio (Gyokuon-hōsō, literally "broadcast in the Emperor's voice").
On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay on the deck of the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.
The Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and Germany, both initially divided between western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, respectively.
However, their paths soon diverged.
In Germany, the western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union officially ended in 1949, with the respective zones becoming separate countries, West Germany and East Germany.
In Austria, however, occupation continued until 1955, when a joint settlement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union permitted the reunification of Austria as a democratic state officially non-aligned with any political bloc (although in practice having better relations with the Western Allies).
A denazification program in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the Nuremberg trials and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.
Germany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory.
Among the eastern territories, Silesia, Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland, and East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, followed by the expulsion to Germany of the nine million Germans from these provinces, as well as three million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia.
By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east.
The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon Line, from which 2 million Poles were expelled; north-east Romania, parts of eastern Finland, and the Baltic states were annexed into the Soviet Union.
Italy lost its monarchy, colonial empire and some European territories.
In an effort to maintain world peace, the Allies formed the United Nations, which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations.
The great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the permanent members of the UN's Security Council.
The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state, the Russian Federation, following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.
Besides Germany, the rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence.
Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities.
As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states.
Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the Soviet Union.
A Communist uprising in Greece was put down with Anglo-American support and the country remained aligned with the West.
Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
The long period of political tensions and military competition between them—the Cold War—would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the world.
In Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administered Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.
Korea, formerly under Japanese colonial rule, was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the United States in the South between 1945 and 1948.
Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the Korean War.
In China, nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in June 1946.
Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949.
In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab–Israeli conflict.
While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.
The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently.
The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.
The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany from 1945 to 1948.
Due to international trade interdependencies, this policy led to an economic stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for several years.
At the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944, the Allied nations drew up an economic framework for the post-war world.
The agreement created the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which later became part of the World Bank Group.
The Bretton Woods system lasted until 1973.
Recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the U.S. Marshall Plan economic aid (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused.
The post-1948 West German recovery has been called the German economic miracle.
Italy also experienced an economic boom and the French economy rebounded.
By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin, and although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country, it continued in relative economic decline for decades.
The Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era, having seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and exacted war reparations from its satellite states.
Japan recovered much later.
China returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952.
Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded.
Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.
The Soviet Union alone lost around 27 million people during the war, including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths.
A quarter of the total people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed.
Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.
An estimated 11 to 17 million civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of Hitler's racist policies, including mass killing of around 6 million Jews, along with Roma, homosexuals, at least 1.9 million ethnic Poles and millions of other Slavs (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), and other ethnic and minority groups.
Between 1941 and 1945, more than 200,000 ethnic Serbs, along with Roma and Jews, were persecuted and murdered by the Axis-aligned Croatian Ustaše in Yugoslavia.
Concurrently, Muslims and Croats were persecuted and killed by Serb nationalist Chetniks, with an estimated 50,000–68,000 victims (of which 41,000 were civilians).
Also, more than 100,000 Poles were massacred by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the Volhynia massacres, between 1943 and 1945.
At the same time, about 10,000–15,000 Ukrainians were killed by the Polish Home Army and other Polish units, in reprisal attacks.
In Asia and the Pacific, the number of people killed by Japanese troops remains contested.
According to R.J. Rummel, the Japanese killed between 3 million and more than 10 million people, with the most probable case of almost 6,000,000 people.
According to the British historian M. R. D. Foot, civilian deaths are between 10 million and 20 million, whereas Chinese military casualties (killed and wounded) are estimated to be over five million.
Other estimates say that up to 30 million people, most of them civilians, were killed.
The most infamous Japanese atrocity was the Nanjing Massacre, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered.
Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the Three Alls policy.
General Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Hebei and Shandong.
Axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons.
The Imperial Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of China (see Unit 731) and in early conflicts against the Soviets.
Both the Germans and the Japanese tested such weapons against civilians, and sometimes on prisoners of war.
The Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish officers, and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD secret police, along with mass civilian deportations to Siberia, in the Baltic states and eastern Poland annexed by the Red Army.
Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially in Germany.
The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million, while figures for women raped by German soldiers in the Soviet Union go as far as ten million.
The mass bombing of cities in Europe and Asia has often been called a war crime, although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during World War II.
The USAAF bombed a total of 67 Japanese cities, killing 393,000 civilians, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and destroying 65% of built-up areas.
Nazi Germany, under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, was responsible for murdering about 6 million Jews in what is now known as the Holocaust.
They also murdered an additional 4 million others who were deemed "unworthy of life" (including the disabled and mentally ill, Soviet prisoners of war, Romani, homosexuals, Freemasons, and Jehovah's Witnesses) as part of a program of deliberate extermination, in effect becoming a "genocidal state".
Soviet POWs were kept in especially unbearable conditions, and 3.6 million Soviet POWs out of 5.7 million died in Nazi camps during the war.
In addition to concentration camps, death camps were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale.
Nazi Germany extensively used forced labourers; about 12 million Europeans from German-occupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German industry, agriculture and war economy.
The Soviet Gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during 1942–43, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates, including foreign citizens of Poland and other countries occupied in 1939–40 by the Soviet Union, as well as Axis POWs.
By the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to NKVD evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators.
Japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates.
The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 percent (for American POWs, 37 percent), seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians.
While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56.
At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or Kōain, for work in mines and war industries.
After 1942, the number reached 10 million.
In Java, between 4 and 10 million rōmusha (Japanese: "manual labourers"), were forced to work by the Japanese military.
About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in Southeast Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.
In Europe, occupation came under two forms.
In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks (27.8 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.
Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.
In the East, the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders.
Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "inferior people" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes.
The Nazis killed an estimated 2.77 million ethnic Poles during the war in addition to Polish-Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East or the West until late 1943.
In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.
Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination, Japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them.
During Japan's initial conquest, it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m3) of oil (~550,000 tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces; and by 1943, was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (7,900,000 m3) of oil (~6.8 million tonnes), 76 percent of its 1940 output rate.
In the 1930s Britain and the United States of America together controlled almost 75% of world mineral output - essential for projecting military power.
In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics.
In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); including colonies, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.
In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this reduces to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.
The United States produced about two-thirds of all munitions used by the Allies in World War II, including warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.
Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies and the war evolved into one of attrition.
While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis was partly due to more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly.
Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so.
To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers; Germany enslaved about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.
Aircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role developed considerably.
Innovations included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).
Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze.
The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.
Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines.
Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship (in place of the battleship).
In the Atlantic, escort carriers became a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap.
Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured.
Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War, were expected by all combatants to be important in the second.
The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics.
Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh Light, Hedgehog, Squid, and homing torpedoes proved effective against German submarines.
Land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms.
The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.
In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.
At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.
This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat.
This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.
Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used.
Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I.
The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German MG 34, and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings.
The assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard post-war infantry weapon for most armed forces.
Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well-known being the German Enigma machine.
Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption.
Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma that benefited from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war.
Another component of military intelligence was deception, which the Allies used to great effect in operations such as Mincemeat and Bodyguard.
Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research, the development of artificial harbours, and oil pipelines under the English Channel.
Penicillin was first developed, mass-produced, and used during the war.
