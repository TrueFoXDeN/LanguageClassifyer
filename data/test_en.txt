The gas used was water gas, i.e. the mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide obtained by passing water over white hot coke.
The benefit of using water gas generated from steam rather than the steam itself was said to be a factor of 30, plus the weight of the engine was said to be 600 pounds compared to 2 to 3 tons for an equivalent steam engine.
This experiment had been funded by the Canal Gas Engine Company, who met the same day and after discussing the experiments in spite of acknowledging the success of the trial decided to wind up the company rather than raise further funds.
In 1832 Brown demonstrated three of his engines of different types and construction at his premises at Eagle Lodge, Old Brompton.
All three engines were in operation and one was of the same type as had been operating successfully on the Croydon Canal raising water from a lower to a higher level since June 1830.
The economics of the Croydon Canal engine were interesting as the gas it consumed was made by turning coal into coke.
The value of the resulting coke and coal tar by-products of making the gas substantially exceeded the cost of the coal, ground rent, repairs etc, so the gas vacuum engine made a profit of over £100 a year before considering the useful work it was doing.
Unfortunately the economics of the Croydon Canal were not so robust and it closed in 1836.
The gas vacuum engine complete with gasometer in situ on Croydon Common was auctioned as a going concern in 1837.
It was described as able to lift water a height of 11 feet at a rate of 2000 gallons per minute.
The reports of an 1834 court case reveal that Brown and Company had been contracted to build a large gas vacuum engine to pump the fens at Soham.
This engine had been designed to pump 7805 gallons of water per minute, lifting water 14 feet at 14 strokes per minute.
It fell short of specification and only delivered two thirds of its rated horsepower, with a lift of 10 feet 6 inches.
The gas vacuum engine was eventually to become a commercial success.
In 1853–1854 Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci invented and patented the Barsanti–Matteucci engine which was a different form of gas vacuum engine.
Developed further by Otto & Langen in Germany, it was put into worldwide production (outside Germany) by Crossley of Manchester between 1867 and 1877.
Examples of this form of engine can be seen working at the Anson Engine Museum.
This success arose from a demonstration of the engine at the World Fair in Paris in 1867, where it was shown to be far more efficient than the current production gas engine of Lenoir which was driven by the pressure resulting from burning the gas, rather than a vacuum.
The success of the vacuum engine was however short lived after the creation of engines that compressed the gas/air mixture before igniting it.
The Santler was a British car built in Malvern Link, Worcestershire, England, between 1889 and 1922.
They have a good claim to be Britain's first makers of petrol driven cars.
The Santler brothers Charles (1864-1940) and Walter (1867-1942) ran a small general engineering company started by their father in about 1875.
They moved into the bicycle business and in 1887 designed a small steam engine which they had running in 1889 and installed in a four-wheeled chassis.
All of this was being done in their spare time while the business moved on to electrical installation with small electric generators run by  steam or gas engines or water turbines.
One of their clients was the mother of pioneering motorist Hon Evelyn Ellis.
Using the expertise gained with small engines, Charles adapted one of the gas engines to replace the steam engine in their experimental car.
The fuel was compressed town gas stored in a tank under the chassis, but this was heavy and gave the car a limited range.
Around 1894 the engine was replaced again by a single-cylinder petrol one.
There has been some controversy over the exact date this was done but in 1896 it was confirmed by the dating committee of the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain.
The car still exists but not with the original engine.
A new and improved car was built in 1897, but again the work from their main business kept vehicle production as a spare-time activity.
They may also have made some motorised bicycles.
A further car, a two-seater, was made in 1901 still with a single-cylinder engine, now mounted at the front, with belt drive to a central gearbox and chain to the rear wheels.
It was subsequently converted to four seats.
A larger four-seater followed in 1907 followed by another gap until a new model appeared in 1913 with a four-cylinder Dorman engine.
This was the first Santler to be advertised for sale, with a two-seater at £175 and four-seater at £190.
There was also a van.
It is not known how many were made.
The First World War stopped further developments, and the factory was turned over to military work.
After the war the brothers tried to sell a motor plough they had developed from 1910 onwards, but this was not a success.
Returning to car production, they brought out a three-wheeler called the Rushabout in 1920 advertised for £165.
This was similar to the car made by the nearby Morgan Motor Company using a front-mounted, air-cooled, V-twin engine, but suspension and transmission were not the same.
It was not a success, and in spite of a drastic reduction in price to £85 did not sell.
About 12 were made but none are known to survive.
The company finally ran out of money and closed in about 1922.
Walter went on to become resident engineer at Ampleforth College, where they had fitted an electric generator in the 1890s.
Charles also left Malvern, but he went to New Zealand to work on railway signalling.
He returned home in 1939 but was killed by the only bomb dropped on Worcester during the Second World War.
Scissor doors (also called flap doors, wing doors, beetle-wing doors, turtle doors, switchblade doors, swing-up doors, upswing doors, Lamborghini doors, and Lambo doors) are automobile doors that rotate vertically at a fixed hinge at the front of the door, rather than outward as with a conventional door.
The first vehicle to feature scissor doors was the 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo concept car, designed by Bertone's Marcello Gandini.
The door style was dictated by Gandini's desire for an innovative design, and by his concern over the car's extremely poor rear visibility.
In order to reverse the car, the driver would be able to lift the door and lean his upper body out of the hatch in order to see behind the car.
The first production car to feature the doors was a Lamborghini, Gandini's Countach; the sports car's wide chassis created similar problems to those found on the Carabo, calling for the unusual door configuration.
This sports car was quite impractical for real life, as due to unusual design it was impossible to backup without doors open wide.
So, such doors were originally offered as a practical measure that helped the driver.
Besides, traditional swing-open doors would make it more difficult to get out of the vehicle due to high door sills.
The doors were used on the Countach's successor, the Diablo, on its replacement, the Murciélago, and on a low-production run derivative of the Murciélago called the Reventón.
The Centenario is the latest Lamborghini car to feature these doors.
They are trademarked.
Having used the exotic door style for several of its cars, the Italian manufacturer has become synonymous with the implementation of scissor doors, which are sometimes colloquially referred to as "Lambo doors".
Today many aftermarket companies are specialized in production of scissor door conversion kits for regular production cars that originally come with regular doors.
A common scissor door conversion kit (also known as a "Lambo-door" kit) includes model specific redesigned door hinges and gas filled shocks.
Such kits are usually bolt-on or weld on and require some modifications to front bumpers and door panels.
Original door panels are not replaced, so a vehicle looks standard from the outside, when the doors are closed.
Offers the possibility of operating the car with the door open, in a manner that would be difficult or impossible in a car with conventional doors.
Because the doors stay within the car's track throughout their range of movement, they are useful when parking in tight spaces.
A gull-wing door style offers similar usability, but the doors swing out from the car's area slightly.
The hinge is placed in a similar location to a conventional door, so a convertible version of the car is possible with the same door style.
Reduces the dooring hazard to cyclists.
The cost of manufacturing the door hinge can be more than that of a conventional door.
The door still impedes access/egress much more than a gullwing and, in some cases, more than a conventional door.
If the height of the parking lot ceiling is insufficient, a car door may come into contact with it when it opens.
In the event of a rollover, emergency egress may be more difficult than with conventional doors, or impossible.
There are different types of scissor doors.
The conventional type rotates to 90 degrees.
Scissor doors can be powered and they usually are.
Vertical lift system (VLS) doors have a scissor door configuration.
The biggest difference is that they are designed to initially open slightly outward before opening upward to allow the top edge of the door to clear the door frame and A-pillar.
Although butterfly doors also move upwards and outwards, VLS doors are not the same as butterfly doors as VLS doors move outward only a small degree compared to butterfly doors.
Although conventional scissor doors rotate to 90 degrees, some can rotate up to 130 degrees; these are commonly used for modified cars.
Such scissor doors have the benefit of not obstructing the entrance or exit to the car as much as conventional scissor doors.
VLS doors also can be made to rotate to 130 degrees.
Some aftermarket example scissor doors are also designed so they can open either vertically (scissor door) or horizontally (conventional door), as the user chooses.
Such doors allow the user to gain the benefits of both types of door, choosing to open the doors in whichever style is best suited to the situation.
Scissor doors are widely noted as a status symbol in popular culture.
In 2012, Migos released a track called "Lambo Doors," in the first line referring to an observer who has never seen such high-status doors.
In 2017, Rick Ross released a track called "Lamborghini Doors", in which he notes a number of objects that are rising up like the titular doors.
In the TV series Silicon Valley, a character remarks that he feels poor when he has regular car doors, rather than doors that go "like this" (gesturing as if his arms were gull-wing doors) or "like this" (gesturing as if his arms were scissor doors), leading to other commentators referring to scissor doors as "billionaire doors".
In print since 1845, it is the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States.
Scientific American is owned by Springer Nature, which is a subsidiary of Holtzbrinck Publishing Group.
Scientific American was founded by inventor and publisher Rufus Porter in 1845 as a four-page weekly newspaper.
The first issue of the large-format New York City newspaper was released on August 28, 1845.
Throughout its early years, much emphasis was placed on reports of what was going on at the U.S. Patent Office.
It also reported on a broad range of inventions including perpetual motion machines, an 1860 device for buoying vessels by Abraham Lincoln, and the universal joint which now can be found in nearly every automobile manufactured.
Current issues include a "this date in history" section, featuring excerpts from articles originally published 50, 100, and 150 years earlier.
Topics include humorous incidents, wrong-headed theories, and noteworthy advances in the history of science and technology.
It started as a weekly publication in August 1845 before turning into a monthly in November 1921.
Porter sold the publication to Alfred Ely Beach, son of media magnate Moses Yale Beach, and Orson Desaix Munn, a mere ten months after founding it.
Editors and co-owners from the Yale family included Frederick C. Beach and his son, Stanley Yale Beach, and from the Munn family, Charles Allen Munn and his nephew, Orson Desaix Munn II.
Until 1948, it remained owned by the families under Munn & Company.
Under Orson Munn's grandson, Orson Desaix Munn III, it had evolved into something of a "workbench" publication, similar to the 20th-century incarnation of Popular Science.
In the years after World War II, the magazine fell into decline.
In 1948, three partners who were planning on starting a new popular science magazine, to be called The Sciences, purchased the assets of the old Scientific American instead and put its name on the designs they had created for their new magazine.
Thus the partners—publisher Gerard Piel, editor Dennis Flanagan, and general manager Donald H. Miller Jr. essentially created a new magazine.
Miller retired in 1979, Flanagan and Piel in 1984, when Gerard Piel's son Jonathan became president and editor; circulation had grown fifteen-fold since 1948.
In 1986, it was sold to the Holtzbrinck Publishing Group of Germany, which has owned it until the Springer-Nature merger.
In the fall of 2008, Scientific American was put under the control of Holtzbrinck's Nature Publishing Group division.
Donald Miller died in December 1998, Gerard Piel in September 2004 and Dennis Flanagan in January 2005.
Mariette DiChristina became editor-in-chief after John Rennie stepped down in June 2009, and stepped down herself in September 2019.
In April 2020, Laura Helmuth assumed the role of editor-in-chief.
The magazine is the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States.
In 2009 the publisher notified collegiate libraries that yearly subscription prices for the magazine would increase by nearly 500% for print and 50% for online access to $1,500 yearly.
In 2013, Danielle N. Lee, a female scientist who blogged at Scientific American, was called a "whore" in an email by an editor at the science website Biology Online after refusing to write professional content without compensation.
When Lee, outraged about the email, wrote a rebuttal on her Scientific American blog, the editor-in-chief of Scientific American, Mariette DiChristina, removed the post.
DiChristina cited legal reasons for removing the blog.
The editor at Biology Online was fired after the incident.
The controversy widened in the ensuing days.
The magazine's blog editor, Bora Zivkovic, was the subject of allegations of sexual harassment by another blogger, Monica Byrne.
Although the alleged incident had occurred about a year earlier, editor Mariette DiChristina informed readers that the incident had been investigated and resolved to Byrne's satisfaction.
However, the incident involving Lee had prompted Byrne to reveal the identity of Zivkovic, following the latter's support of Lee.
Zivkovic admitted the incident with Byrne had taken place.
He apologized to Byrne, and referred to the incident as "singular", stating that his behavior was not "engaged in before or since".
Zivkovic resigned from the board of Science Online, the popular science blogging conference that he co-founded with Anton Zuiker.
Following Zivkovic's admission, several female bloggers, including other bloggers for the magazine, wrote their own accounts, alleging additional incidents of sexual harassment, although none of these accounts were independently investigated.
A day after these new revelations, Zivkovic resigned from his position at Scientific American.
Offices of the Scientific American have included 37 Park Row in Manhattan and the Woolworth Building in 1915 when it was just finished two years earlier in 1913.
The Woolworth Building was at the time one of the first skyscrapers in the city and the tallest one in the world.
Founded in Chongqing, the simplified Chinese magazine was transferred to Beijing in 2001.
Later in 2005, a newer edition, Global Science (环球科学), was published instead of Kexue, which shut down due to financial problems.
A traditional Chinese edition, known as Scientist, was introduced to Taiwan in 2002.
The Hungarian edition Tudomány existed between 1984 and 1992.
In 1986, an Arabic edition, Oloom Magazine, was published.
In 2002, a Portuguese edition was launched in Brazil.
The Spanish edition ended in 2023 due to the worsening of economic conditions.
Some famous individuals who penned articles in the magazine included Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Jonas Salk, Marie Curie, Stephen Hawking, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Stephen Jay Gould, Bill Gates, Nikola Tesla, and more.
Charles Darwin was featured when he published On the Origin of Species, as well as the Wright Brothers when they were working on their flying machines.
The magazine also covered the U.S. through its Sputnik moment with the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite, which symbolically started the "Space Age".
Dennis Flanagan (1919–2005), fifth editor (1947–1984).
The Scientific American 50 award was started in 2002 to recognize contributions to science and technology during the magazine's previous year.
The magazine's 50 awards cover many categories including agriculture, communications, defence, environment, and medical diagnostics.
The complete list of each year's winners appear in the December issue of the magazine, as well as on the magazine's web site.
In March 1996, Scientific American launched its own website that included articles from current and past issues, online-only features, daily news, special reports, and trivia,  among other things.
The website introduced a paywall in April 2019, with readers able to view a few articles for free each month.
From 1990 to 2005 Scientific American produced a television program on PBS called Scientific American Frontiers with hosts Woodie Flowers and Alan Alda.
Topics covered dozens of areas of scientific knowledge and included in-depth essays on: The Animal Mind; Atmosphere, Climate, and Change; Beyond the Third Dimension; Cosmic Clouds; Cycles of Life • Civilization and the Biosphere; The Discovery of Subatomic Particles; Diversity and the Tropical Rain Forest; Earthquakes and Geological Discovery; Exploring Planetary Worlds; Gravity's Fatal Attraction; Fire; Fossils and the History of Life; From Quarks to the Cosmos; A Guided Tour of the Living Cell; Human Diversity; Perception; The Solar System; Sun and Earth; The Science of Words (Linguistics); The Science of Musical Sound; The Second Law (of Thermodynamics); Stars; Supercomputing and the Transformation of Science.
Scientific American launched a publishing imprint in 2010 in partnership with Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
DiChristina, Mariette (2017).
Scientific American – The Science Behind the Debates.
Special Collector's Edition.
Winter 2017/2018.
Scientific American.
A "collection of updated or adapted Scientific American articles and shorter pieces... ".

there really is no debate where the science is concerned'".
Contributors include Seth Shostak, Paul Offit, Richard Dawkins and Harriet Hall.
The Saône ( SOHN, French: [son]; Arpitan: Sona; Latin: Arar) is a river in eastern France.
It is a right tributary of the Rhône, rising at Vioménil in the Vosges department and joining the Rhône in Lyon, at the southern end of the Presqu'île.
The name Saône derives from that of the Gallic river goddess Souconna, which has also been connected with a local Celtic tribe, the Sequanes.
Monastic copyists progressively transformed Souconna to Saoconna, which ultimately gave rise to Saône.
The other recorded ancient names for the river were Brigoulus  and Arar.
The Saône rises at Vioménil at the foot of the cliff of the Faucilles in the Vosges at an elevation of 392 metres (1,286 ft); it flows into the Rhône at Lyon at an elevation of 158 metres (518 ft).
Its length is 473 kilometres (294 mi).
Its largest tributary is the Doubs; upstream of receiving the Doubs at Verdun-sur-le-Doubs in Saône-et-Loire, the Saône is called the "Petite Saône" (lesser Saône), which reflects the large contribution of the Doubs to the Saône.
In fact the Doubs's mean annual flow rate is slightly stronger than that of the Petite Saône, 175 cubic metres per second (6,200 cu ft/s) compared to 160 cubic metres per second (5,700 cu ft/s); some thus assert that it is in fact the Saône that flows into the Doubs.
Nonetheless, the Saône has a substantially larger watershed than the Doubs, at 11,500 square kilometres (4,400 sq mi) vs. 7,500 square kilometres (2,900 sq mi).
At 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) the Saône has the largest watershed of any French river that does not flow directly into the sea, covering approximately 1/18 of metropolitan France.
In pre-Roman times the river's name was "Arar", a doubling of the Indo-European root ar (water).
According to Julius Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War this doubling reflected the idea that it was difficult to identify the direction of the river due to its slow rate of flow.
The Battle of the Arar was the first major battle of the Gallic Wars.
Its current name came from a sacred spring, Sauc-Onna, located at Chalon, which was used by Roman legionaries to refer to the entire river.
R indicates a right tributary, L indicates a left tributary.
The Saône is navigable from its confluence with the Coney at Corre in the north of the département Haute-Saône all the way to its confluence with the Rhône (itself a navigable river) at La Mulatière, in Lyon.
The navigable stretch is 367 kilometres (228 mi) long, of which 206 kilometres (128 mi) has been redeveloped to European high-capacity dimensions from Saint-Symphorien-sur-Saône to Lyon.
It has 5 locks.
The 161 km long part upstream from Saint-Symphorien-sur-Saône to Corre, also named Petite Saône, is navigable for Freycinet gauge ships and has 19 locks.
The Saône is linked with the Loire by the Canal du Centre, with the Yonne by the Canal de Bourgogne, with the Marne by the Canal entre Champagne et Bourgogne (previously the Canal de la Marne à la Saône), with the Meuse by the Canal de l'Est, whose southern branch has been renamed the Canal des Vosges, and with the Rhine by the Canal du Rhône au Rhin.
All the canals are Freycinet gauge.
Also navigable are the small Canal de Pont-de-Vaux (3 km), the Seille, navigable in a 40-kilometre (25 mi) stretch up to Louhans, as well as the lower part of the Doubs.
None of these three connect the Saône to any other waterway.
The lesser Saône has a tendency to flood (sometimes influenced by snow), with a very strong oceanic effect.
The soils are not susceptible to much infiltration, so that they saturate quickly which contributes to surface runoff.
The flow rate grows very quickly, and after receiving the waters of the Lanterne, the Saône already becomes a powerful river.
The mean annual flow rate, or discharge, of the Saône has been measured over 50 years (as of 2013) at the Ray-sur-Saône hydrological station, situated about 30 kilometres (19 mi) after the Lanterne confluence between Port-sur-Saône and Gray.
The figure is 59.7 cubic metres per second (2,110 cu ft/s) for a watershed area of 3,740 square kilometres (1,440 sq mi) (the upper basin of the lesser Saône), and has an annual maximum of 64.5 cubic metres per second (2,280 cu ft/s) and a minimum of 54.8 cubic metres per second (1,940 cu ft/s).
The river exhibits seasonal variations in flow rate, with winter floods from 84 to 108 cubic metres per second (3,000 to 3,800 cu ft/s) from December to March inclusive, and summer reductions in July/August/September falling to a monthly average of 16.9 cubic metres per second (600 cu ft/s) in August.
The runoff curve number in the upper basin of the lesser Saône is 505 millimetres (19.9 in) annually, cf.
687 millimetres (27.0 in) for the Lanterne, an elevated figure resulting from the very high rainfall in the Vosgian part of its watershed.
The specific flow rate rises to 16.0 litres per second per square kilometre of watershed.
The maximum instantaneous recorded flow rate was 930 cubic metres per second (33,000 cu ft/s) on December 19, 1982.
The greater Saône is formed by the confluence of the Doubs and the lesser Saône at Verdun-sur-le-Doubs.
The Doubs brings a mean annual flow rate of 175 cubic metres per second (6,200 cu ft/s), and the lesser Saône, 160 cubic metres per second (5,700 cu ft/s).
The greater Saône has only modest tributaries which have little effect on floods or other hydrological properties.
It flows in a vast plain approximately 3 kilometres (2 mi) wide as far as Lyon in the basin of the former Bressan lake.
The slope is very gradual, and without hydraulic projects up to the north of Chalon aimed at guaranteeing a deep navigation channel, overflows would be more frequent.
At the Couzon-au-Mont-d'Or hydrological station, where the river enters the Lyon area, measurements taken between 1969 and 1986 revealed a mean annual flow rate of 473 cubic metres per second (16,700 cu ft/s), with a 100-year flood flow rate of 3,180 cubic metres per second (112,000 cu ft/s)
The runoff curve number from the river's entire watershed is 501 millimetres (19.7 in), and the specific flow rate rises to 15.8 litres per second per square km of watershed.
Overall, the average flow rate in Lyon is 475 cubic metres per second (16,800 cu ft/s), with a minimum of 153 cubic metres per second (5,400 cu ft/s), in August, and a maximum of 954 cubic metres per second (33,700 cu ft/s), in February.
When the Saône floods, the impact varies considerably over the course of the river.
A large flood with a strong flow rate upstream can be largely attenuated in the Bressan plain so as to have only moderate impact at Mâcon, particularly if it carries a limited volume of water.
By contrast, a medium-sized flood of the lesser Saône can turn into a significant flood downstream, if the Doubs brings in a similar contribution at about the same time.
The flood of November 1840, with an estimated flow rate of almost 4,000 cubic metres per second (140,000 cu ft/s), destroyed numerous habitations along the river valley.
Many plaques marking this serious event are still visible in the villages affected.
The high water measured at flood scales reached 8.05 metres (26.4 ft) at Mâcon and 7.28 metres (23.9 ft) at Chalon, or about 6 and 5.5 metres (20 and 18 ft) respectively above normal levels).
The largest floods in the last 50 years as of 2006: January 1955, March 1970, December 1981 and 1982, May 1983, March 2001 and 2006.
The reference flood in town planning is the 100-year flood.
This reference was in the course of being modified as maps linked to modelling the 1840 flood in modern town planning conditions were distributed to local mayors in December 2008, and as new prevention plans were ordered for 2012.
A sedan or saloon (British English) is a passenger car in a three-box configuration with separate compartments for an engine, passengers, and cargo.
The first recorded use of sedan in reference to an automobile body occurred in 1912.
The name derives from the 17th-century litter known as a sedan chair, a one-person enclosed box with windows and carried by porters.
Variations of the sedan style include the close-coupled sedan, club sedan, convertible sedan, fastback sedan, hardtop sedan, notchback sedan, and sedanet.
a rear interior volume of at least 33 cu ft (0.93 m3).
When a manufacturer produces two-door sedan and four-door sedan versions of the same model, the shape and position of the greenhouse on both versions may be identical, with only the B-pillar positioned further back to accommodate the longer doors on the two-door versions.
The first recorded use of sedan for an automobile body occurred in 1912 when the Studebaker Four and Studebaker Six models were marketed as sedans.
There were fully enclosed automobile bodies before 1912.
Long before that time, the same fully enclosed but horse-drawn carriages were known as a brougham in the United Kingdom, berline in France, and berlina in Italy; the latter two have become the terms for sedans in these countries.
It is sometimes stated that the 1899 Renault Voiturette Type B (a 2-seat car with an extra external seat for a footman/mechanic) was the first sedan, since it is the first known car to be produced with a roof.
A one-off instance of similar coachwork is also known in a 1900 De Dion-Bouton Type D. In American English, Latin American Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese, the term sedan is used (accented as sedán in Spanish).
In British English, a car of this configuration is called a saloon ().
Hatchback sedans are known simply as hatchbacks (not hatchback saloons); long-wheelbase luxury saloons with a division between the driver and passengers are limousines.
In Australia and New Zealand, sedan is now predominantly used; they were previously simply cars.
In the 21st century, saloon remains in the long-established names of particular motor races.
In other languages, sedans are known as berline (French), berlina (European Spanish, European Portuguese, Romanian, and Italian), though they may include hatchbacks.
These names, like the sedan, all come from forms of passenger transport used before the advent of automobiles.
In German, a sedan is called Limousine and a limousine is a Stretch-Limousine.
In the United States, two-door sedan models were marketed as Tudor in the Ford Model A (1927–1931) series.
Automakers use different terms to differentiate their products and for Ford's sedan body styles "the tudor (2-door) and fordor (4-door) were marketing terms designed to stick in the minds of the public."
Ford continued to use the Tudor name for 5-window coupes, 2-door convertibles, and roadsters since all had two doors.
The Tudor name was also used to describe the Škoda 1101/1102 introduced in 1946.
The public popularized the name for a two-door model and was then applied by the automaker to the entire line that included a four-door sedan and station wagon versions.
In the United States, the notchback sedan distinguishes models with a horizontal trunk lid.
The term is generally only referred to in marketing when it is necessary to differentiate between two sedan body styles (e.g., notchback and fastback) of the same model range.
Several sedans have a fastback profile but a hatchback-style tailgate is hinged at the roof.
Examples include the Peugeot 309, Škoda Octavia, Hyundai Elantra XD, Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, BMW 4 Series Grand Coupe, Audi A5 Sportback, and Tesla Model S. The names hatchback and sedan are often used to differentiate between body styles of the same model.
To avoid confusion, the term hatchback sedan is not often used.
There have been many sedans with a fastback style.
Hardtop sedans were a popular body style in the United States from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Hardtops are manufactured without a B-pillar leaving uninterrupted open space or, when closed, glass along the side of the vehicle.
The top was intended to look like a convertible's top.
However, it was fixed and made of hard material that did not fold.
All manufacturers in the United States from the early 1950s into the 1970s provided at least a 2-door hardtop model in their range and a 4-door hardtop.
The lack of side bracing demanded a strong, heavy chassis frame to combat unavoidable flexing.
The pillarless design was also available in four-door models using unibody construction.
For example, Chrysler moved to unibody designs for most of its models in 1960 and American Motors Corporation offered four-door sedans, as well a four-door station wagon from 1958 until 1960 in the Rambler and Ambassador series.
In 1973, the US government passed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 216 creating a standard roof strength test to measure the integrity of roof structure in motor vehicles to come into effect some years later.
Hardtop sedan body style production ended with the 1978 Chrysler Newport.
Roofs were covered with vinyl, and B-pillars were minimized by styling methods like matt black finishes.
Stylists and engineers soon developed more subtle solutions.
A close-coupled sedan is a body style produced in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s.
Their two-box boxy styling made these sedans more like crossover vehicles than traditional three-box sedans.
Like other close-coupled body styles, the rear seats are farther forward than a regular sedan.
: 43  This reduced the length of the body; close-coupled sedans, also known as town sedans, were the shortest of the sedan models offered.
A two-door sedan for four or five passengers but with less room for passengers than a standard sedan.
A Coach body has no external trunk for luggage.
Haajanen says it can be difficult to tell the difference between a Club and a Brougham and a Coach body, as if manufacturers were more concerned with marketing their product than adhering to strict body style definitions.
Close-coupled saloons originated as four-door thoroughbred sporting horse-drawn carriages with little room for rear passengers' feet.
In automotive use, manufacturers in the United Kingdom used the term to develop the chummy body, where passengers were forced to be friendly because they were tightly packed.
They provided weather protection for extra passengers in what would otherwise be a two-seater car.
Two-door versions would be described in the United States and France as coach bodies.
A postwar example is the Rover 3 Litre Coupé.
From the 1910s to the 1950s, several United States manufacturers have named models either Sedanet or Sedanette.
The term originated as a smaller version of the sedan; however, it has also been used for convertibles and fastback coupes.
Models that have been called Sedanet or Sedanette include the 1917 Dort Sedanet, King, 1919 Lexington, 1930s Cadillac Fleetwood Sedanette, 1949 Cadillac Series 62 Sedanette, 1942-1951 Buick Super Sedanet, and 1956 Studebaker.
Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion by which humans and other animals move rapidly on foot.
Running is a gait with an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions).
This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight, and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.
A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride co-occur, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity.
The term "running" can refer to a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.
Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.
It is hypothesized that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably to hunt animals.
Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas.
Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE.
Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.
It is thought that human running evolved at least four and a half million years ago out of the ability of the ape-like Australopithecus, an early ancestor of humans, to walk upright on two legs.
Early humans most likely developed into endurance runners from the practice of persistence hunting of animals, the activity of following and chasing until a prey is too exhausted to flee, succumbing to "chase myopathy" (Sears 2001), and that human features such as the nuchal ligament, abundant sweat glands, the Achilles tendons, big knee joints and muscular glutei maximi, were changes caused by this type of activity (Bramble & Lieberman 2004, et al.).
The theory as first proposed used comparative physiological evidence and the natural habits of animals when running, indicating the likelihood of this activity as a successful hunting method.
Further evidence from observation of modern-day hunting practices also indicated this likelihood (Carrier et al. 1984).
According to Sears (p. 12) scientific investigation (Walker & Leakey 1993) of the Nariokotome skeleton provided further evidence for the Carrier theory.
Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas such as Greece, Egypt, Asia, and the East African Rift in Africa.
The Tailteann Games, an Irish sporting festival in honor of the goddess Tailtiu, dates back to 1829 BCE and is one of the earliest records of competitive running.
The origins of the Olympics and Marathon running are shrouded by myth and legend, though the first recorded games took place in 776 BCE.
Running in Ancient Greece can be traced back to these games of 776 BCE.
...I suspect that the sun, moon, earth, stars, and heaven, which are still the gods of many barbarians, were the only gods known to the aboriginal Hellenes.
Seeing that they were always moving and running, from their running nature they were called gods or runners (Thus, Theontas)...
Running gait can be divided into two phases regarding the lower extremity: stance and swing.
These can be further divided into absorption, propulsion, initial swing, and terminal swing.
Due to the continuous nature of running gait, no certain point is assumed to be the beginning.
However, for simplicity, it will be assumed that absorption and footstrike mark the beginning of the running cycle in a body already in motion.
Footstrike occurs when a plantar portion of the foot makes initial contact with the ground.
Common footstrike types include forefoot, midfoot, and heel strike types.
These are characterized by initial contact of the ball of the foot, ball and heel of the foot simultaneously and heel of the foot respectively.
During this time, the hip joint is undergoing extension from being in maximal flexion from the previous swing phase.
For proper force absorption, the knee joint should be flexed upon the footstrike, and the ankle should be slightly in front of the body.
Footstrike begins the absorption phase as forces from initial contact are attenuated throughout the lower extremity.
Absorption of forces continues as the body moves from footstrike to midstance due to vertical propulsion from the toe-off during a previous gait cycle.
Midstance is when the lower extremity limb of focus is in knee flexion directly underneath the trunk, pelvis, and hips.
At this point, propulsion begins to occur as the hips undergo hip extension, the knee joint undergoes extension, and the ankle undergoes plantar flexion.
Propulsion continues until the leg is extended behind the body and toe-off occurs.
This involves a maximal hip extension, knee extension, and plantar flexion for the subject, resulting in the body being pushed forward from this motion, and the ankle/foot leaves the ground as the initial swing begins.
The setup for propulsion begins at the end of the terminal swing when the hip joint flexes, allowing the hip extensors to generate force as they accelerate through the maximal range of motion.
As the hip extensors transition from inhibitory to primary muscle movers, the lower extremity moves back towards the ground, aided by the stretch reflex and gravity.
The footstrike and absorption phases follow, leading to two possible outcomes.
With a heel strike, this phase may be just a continuation of momentum from the stretch reflex, gravity, and light hip extension, offering little force absorption through the ankle joint.
On the other hand, a mid/forefoot strike helps in shock absorption, supporting plantar flexion from midstance to toe-off.
Actual propulsion begins as the lower extremity enters midstance.
The hip extensors continue contracting, assisted by gravity and the stretch reflex from maximal hip flexion during the terminal swing.
Hip extension pulls the ground underneath the body, propelling the runner forward.
During midstance, the knee should be slightly flexed due to elastic loading from the absorption and footstrike phases, preserving forward momentum.
The ankle joint is in dorsiflexion at this point, either elastically loaded from a mid/forefoot strike or preparing for stand-alone concentric plantar flexion.
The final propulsive movements during toe-off involve all three joints: ankle, knee, and hip.
The plantar flexors push off from the ground, returning from dorsiflexion in midstance.
This can occur either by releasing the elastic load from an earlier mid/forefoot strike or through concentric contraction from a heel strike.
With a forefoot strike, the ankle and knee joints release their stored elastic energy from the footstrike/absorption phase.
The quadriceps group/knee extensors fully extend the knee, pushing the body off the ground.
Simultaneously, the knee flexors and stretch reflex pull the knee back into flexion, initiating the initial swing phase.
The hip extensors extend to the maximum, contributing to forces pulling and pushing off the ground, as well as initiating knee flexion and the initial swing phase.
Initial swing is the response of both stretch reflexes and concentric movements to the propulsion movements of the body.
Hip flexion and knee flexion occur, beginning the return of the limb to the starting position and setting up for another foot strike.
The initial swing ends at midswing when the limb is again directly underneath the trunk, pelvis, and hip with the knee joint flexed and hip flexion continuing.
Terminal swing then begins as hip flexion continues to the point of activation of the stretch reflex of the hip extensors.
The knee begins to extend slightly as it swings to the anterior portion of the body.
The foot then makes contact with the ground with a foot strike, completing the running cycle of one side of the lower extremity.
Each limb of the lower extremity works opposite to the other.
When one side is in toe-off/propulsion, the other hand is in the swing/recovery phase preparing for footstrike.
Following toe-off and the beginning of the initial swing of one side, there is a flight phase where neither extremity is in contact with the ground due to the opposite side finishing terminal swing.
As the footstrike of the one hand occurs, the initial swing continues.
The opposing limbs meet with one in midstance and midswing, beginning the propulsion and terminal swing phases.
The upper extremity function serves mainly in providing balance in conjunction with the opposing side of the lower extremity.
The movement of each leg is paired with the opposite arm, which serves to counterbalance the body, particularly during the stance phase.
The arms move most effectively (as seen in elite athletes) with the elbow joint at approximately 90 degrees or less, the hands swinging from the hips up to mid-chest level with the opposite leg, the Humerus moving from being parallel with the trunk to approximately 45 degrees shoulder extension (never passing the trunk in flexion) and with as little movement in the transverse plane as possible.
The trunk also rotates in conjunction with arm swing.
It mainly serves as a balance point from which the limbs are anchored.
Thus trunk motion should remain mostly stable with little motion except for slight rotation, as excessive movement would contribute to transverse motion and wasted energy.
Recent research into various forms of running has focused on the differences in the potential injury risks and shock absorption capabilities between heel and mid/forefoot footstrikes.
It has been shown that heel striking is generally associated with higher rates of injury and impact due to inefficient shock absorption and inefficient biomechanical compensations for these forces.
This is due to pressures from a heel strike traveling through bones for shock absorption rather than being absorbed by muscles.
Since bones cannot disperse forces easily, the forces are transmitted to other parts of the body, including ligaments, joints, and bones in the rest of the lower extremities up to the lower back.
This causes the body to use abnormal compensatory motions in an attempt to avoid serious bone injuries.
These compensations include internal rotation of the tibia, knee, and hip joints.
Excessive compensation over time has been linked to a higher risk of injuries in those joints and the muscles involved in those motions.
Conversely, a mid/forefoot strike has been associated with greater efficiency and lower injury risk due to the triceps surae being used as a lever system to absorb forces with the muscles eccentrically rather than through the bone.
Landing with a mid/forefoot strike has also been shown to properly attenuate shock and allow the triceps surae to aid in propulsion via reflexive plantarflexion after stretching to absorb ground contact forces.
Thus a mid/forefoot strike may aid in propulsion.
However, even among elite athletes, there are variations in self-selected footstrike types.
This is especially true in longer distance events, where there is a prevalence of heel strikers.
There does tend however to be a greater percentage of mid/forefoot striking runners in the elite fields, particularly in the faster racers and the winning individuals or groups.
While one could attribute the faster speeds of elite runners compared to recreational runners with similar footstrikes to physiological differences, the hip, and joints have been left out of the equation for proper propulsion.
This raises the question of how heel-striking elite distance runners can keep up such high paces with a supposedly inefficient and injurious foot strike technique.
Biomechanical factors associated with elite runners include increased hip function, use, and stride length over recreational runners.
An increase in running speeds causes increased ground reaction forces, and elite distance runners must compensate for this to maintain their pace over long distances.
These forces are attenuated through increased stride length via increased hip flexion and extension through decreased ground contact time and more energy being used in propulsion.
With increased propulsion in the horizontal plane, less impact occurs from the decreased force in the vertical plane.
Increased hip flexion allows for increased use of the hip extensors through midstance and toe-off, allowing for more force production.
The difference even between world-class and national-level 1500-m runners has been associated with more efficient hip joint function.
The increase in velocity likely comes from the increased range of motion in hip flexion and extension, allowing for greater acceleration and speed.
The hip extensors and extension have been linked to more powerful knee extension during toe-off, contributing to propulsion.
Stride length must be appropriately increased with some degree of knee flexion maintained through the terminal swing phases, as excessive knee extension during this phase along with footstrike has been associated with higher impact forces due to braking and an increased prevalence of heel striking.
Elite runners tend to exhibit some degree of knee flexion at footstrike and midstance, which first serves to eccentrically absorb impact forces in the quadriceps muscle group.
Secondly it allows for the knee joint to contract concentrically and provides significant aid in propulsion during toe-off as the quadriceps group is capable of producing large amounts of force.
Recreational runners have been shown to increase stride length through increased knee extension rather than increased hip flexion, as exhibited by elite runners, which provides an intense braking motion with each step and decreases the rate and efficiency of knee extension during toe-off, slowing down speed.
Knee extension, however, contributes to additional stride length and propulsion during toe-off and is seen more frequently in elite runners as well.
Leaning forward places a runner's center of mass on the front part of the foot, which avoids landing on the heel and facilitates the use of the spring mechanism of the foot.
It also makes it easier for the runner to avoid landing the foot in front of the center of mass and the resultant braking effect.
While upright posture is essential, a runner should maintain a relaxed frame and use their core to keep posture upright and stable.
This helps prevent injury as long as the body is neither rigid nor tense.
The most common running mistakes are tilting the chin up and scrunching shoulders.
Exercise physiologists have found that the stride rates are extremely consistent across professional runners, between 185 and 200 steps per minute.
The main difference between long- and short-distance runners is the length of stride rather than the rate of stride.
During running, the speed at which the runner moves may be calculated by multiplying the cadence (steps per minute) by the stride length.
Running is often measured in terms of pace, expressed in units of minutes per mile or minutes per kilometer (the inverse of speed, in mph or km/h).
Some coaches advocate training at a combination of specific paces related to one's fitness to stimulate various physiological improvements.
Different types of stride are necessary for different types of running.
When sprinting, runners stay on their toes bringing their legs up, using shorter and faster strides.
Long-distance runners tend to have more relaxed strides that vary.
While there exists the potential for injury while running (just as there is in any sport), there are many benefits.
Some of these benefits include potential weight loss, improved cardiovascular and respiratory health (reducing the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases), improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced total blood cholesterol, strengthening of bones (and potentially increased bone density), possible strengthening of the immune system and an improved self-esteem and emotional state.
Running, like all forms of regular exercise, can effectively slow or reverse the effects of aging.
Even people who have already experienced a heart attack are 20% less likely to develop serious heart problems if more engaged in running or any type of aerobic activity.
Although an optimal amount of vigorous aerobic exercise such as running might bring benefits related to lower cardiovascular disease and life extension, an excessive dose (e.g., marathons) might have an opposite effect associated with cardiotoxicity.
Running can assist people in losing weight, staying in shape and improving body composition.
Research suggests that the person of average weight will burn approximately 100 calories per mile run.
Running increases one's metabolism, even after running; one will continue to burn an increased level of calories for a short time after the run.
Different speeds and distances are appropriate for different individual health and fitness levels.
For new runners, it takes time to get into shape.
The key is consistency and a slow increase in speed and distance.
While running, it is best to pay attention to how one's body feels.
If a runner is gasping for breath or feels exhausted while running, it may be beneficial to slow down or try a shorter distance for a few weeks.
If a runner feels that the pace or distance is no longer challenging, then the runner may want to speed up or run farther.
Running can also have psychological benefits, as many participants in the sport report feeling an elated, euphoric state, often referred to as a "runner's high".
Running is frequently recommended as therapy for people with clinical depression and people coping with addiction.
A possible benefit may be the enjoyment of nature and scenery, which also improves psychological well-being (see Ecopsychology § Practical benefits).
In animal models, running has been shown to increase the number of newly created neurons within the brain.
This finding could have significant implications in aging as well as learning and memory.
A recent study published in Cell Metabolism has also linked running with improved memory and learning skills.
Running is an effective way to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and inflammation.
It helps people who struggle with seasonal affective disorder by running outside when it is sunny and warm.
Running can improve mental alertness and sleep.
Both research and clinical experience have shown that exercise can be a treatment for serious depression and anxiety even some physicians prescribe exercise to most of their patients.
Running can have a longer-lasting effect than anti-depressants.
The non-threatening environment offered by running generates a sense of achievement and belonging which helps with mental illness.
Many injuries are associated with running because of its high-impact nature.
Change in running volume may lead to development of patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome, patellar tendinopathy, plica syndrome, and medial tibial stress syndrome.
Change in running pace may cause Achilles Tendinitis, gastrocnemius injuries, and plantar fasciitis.
Repetitive stress on the same tissues without enough time for recovery or running with improper form can lead to many of the above.
Runners generally attempt to minimize these injuries by warming up before exercise, focusing on proper running form, performing strength training exercises, eating a well balanced diet, allowing time for recovery, and "icing" (applying ice to sore muscles or taking an ice bath).
Some runners may experience injuries when running on concrete surfaces.
The problem with running on concrete is that the body adjusts to this flat surface running, and some of the muscles will become weaker, along with the added impact of running on a harder surface.
Therefore, it can be beneficial to change terrain occasionally – such as trail, beach, or grass running.
This is more unstable ground and allows the legs to strengthen different muscles.
Runners should be wary of twisting their ankles on such terrain.
Running downhill also increases knee stress and should, therefore, be avoided.
Reducing the frequency and duration can also prevent injury.
Barefoot running has been promoted as a means of reducing running related injuries, but this remains controversial and a majority of professionals advocate the wearing of appropriate shoes as the best method for avoiding injury.
However, a study in 2013 concluded that wearing neutral shoes is not associated with increased injuries.
Another common, running-related injury is chafing, caused by repetitive rubbing of one piece of skin against another, or against an article of clothing.
One common location for chafe to occur is the runner's upper thighs.
The skin feels coarse and develops a rash-like look.
A variety of deodorants and special anti-chafing creams are available to treat such problems.
Chafe is also likely to occur on the nipple.
There are a variety of home remedies that runners use to deal with chafing while running such as band-aids and using grease to reduce friction.
Prevention is key which is why form fitting clothes are important.
An iliotibial band is a muscle and tendon that is attached to the hip and runs the length of the thigh to attach to the upper part of the tibia, and the band is what helps the knee to bend.
This is an injury that is located at the knee and shows symptoms of swelling outside the knee.
Iliotibial band syndrome is also known as "runner's knee" or "jogger's knee" because it can be caused by jogging or running.
Once pain or swelling is noticeable it is important to put ice on it immediately and it is recommended to rest the knee for better healing.
Most knee injuries can be treated by light activity and much rest for the knee.
In more serious cases, arthroscopy is the most common to help repair ligaments but severe situations reconstructive surgery would be needed.
A survey was taken in 2011 with knee injuries being 22.7% of the most common injuries.
A more known injury is medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) which is the accurate name for shin splints.
This is caused during running when the muscle is being overused along the front of the lower leg with symptoms that affect 2 to 6 inches of the muscle.
Shin Splints have sharp, splinter-like pain, that is typically X-rayed by doctors but is not necessary for shin splints to be diagnosed.
To help prevent shin splints it is commonly known to stretch before and after a workout session, and also avoid heavy equipment especially during the first couple of workout sessions.
Also to help prevent shin splints do not increase the intensity of a workout more than 10% a week.
To treat shin splints it is important to rest with the least amount of impact on your legs and apply ice to the area.
A survey showed that shin splints make up 12.7% of the most common injuries in running, with blisters being the top percentage at 30.9%.
Running is both a competition and a type of training for sports that have running or endurance components.
As a sport, it is split into events divided by distance and sometimes includes permutations such as the obstacles in steeplechase and hurdles.
Running races are contests to determine which of the competitors is able to run a certain distance in the shortest time.
Today, competitive running events make up the core of the sport of athletics.
Events are usually grouped into several classes, each requiring substantially different athletic strengths and involving different tactics, training methods, and types of competitors.
Running competitions have probably existed for most of humanity's history and were a key part of the ancient Olympic Games as well as the modern Olympics.
The activity of running went through a period of widespread popularity in the United States during the running boom of the 1970s.
Over the next two decades, as many as 25 million Americans were doing some form of running or jogging – accounting for roughly one tenth of the population.
Today, road racing is a popular sport among non-professional athletes, who included over 7.7 million people in America alone in 2002.
Footspeed, or sprint speed, is the maximum speed at which a human can run.
It is affected by many factors, varies greatly throughout the population, and is important in athletics and many sports.
The fastest human footspeed on record is 44.7 km/h (12.4 m/s; 27.8 mph), seen during a 100-meter sprint (average speed between the 60th and the 80th meter) by Usain Bolt.
Track running events are individual or relay events with athletes racing over specified distances on an oval running track.
The events are categorized as sprints, middle and long-distance, and hurdling.
Road running takes place on a measured course over an established road (as opposed to track and cross country running).
These events normally range from distances of 5 kilometers to longer distances such as half marathons and marathons, and they may involve scores of runners or wheelchair entrants.
Cross country running takes place over the open or rough terrain.
The courses used for these events may include grass, mud, woodlands, hills, flat ground and water.
It is a popular participatory sport and is one of the events which, along with track and field, road running, and racewalking, makes up the umbrella sport of athletics.
The majority of popular races do not incorporate a significant change in elevation as a key component of a course.
There are several, disparate variations that feature significant inclines or declines.
These fall into two main groups.
The naturalistic group is based on outdoor racing over geographical features.
Among these are the cross country-related sports of fell running (a tradition associated with Northern Europe) and trail running (mainly ultramarathon distances), the running/climbing combination of skyrunning (organised by the International Skyrunning Federation with races across North America, Europe and East Asia) and the mainly trail- and road-centred mountain running (governed by the World Mountain Running Association and based mainly in Europe).
The second variety of vertical running is based on human structures, such as stairs and man-made slopes.
The foremost type of this is tower running, which sees athletes compete indoors, running up steps within very tall structures such as the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building.
Sprints are short running events in athletics and track and field.
Races over short distances are among the oldest running competitions.
The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event – the stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other.
There are three sprinting events which are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres.
These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements which were later altered to metric: the 100 m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200 m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400 m was the successor to the 440-yard dash or quarter-mile race.
At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the contest progresses and momentum is gained.
Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400 m indoors.
Races up to 100 m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete's maximum speed.
All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance.
Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so as lactic acid builds up, and leg muscles begin to be deprived of oxygen.
The 60 metres is a common indoor event and it an indoor world championship event.
Other less-common events include the 50 metres, 55 metres, 300 metres and 500 metres which are used in some high and collegiate competitions in the United States.
The 150 metres, is rarely competed:
Pietro Mennea set a world best in 1983, Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey went head-to-head over the distance in 1997, and Usain Bolt improved Mennea's record in 2009.
Middle-distance running events are track races longer than sprints up to 3000 metres.
The standard middle distances are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event.
The 880-yard run, or half-mile, was the forebear to the 800 m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s.
The 1500 m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500 m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 1900s.
Examples of longer-distance running events are long-distance track races, half marathons, marathons, ultramarathons, and multiday races.
A sport utility vehicle (SUV) is a car classification that combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.
There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV and usage of the term varies between countries.
Thus, it is "a loose term that traditionally covers a broad range of vehicles with four-wheel drive."
Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV.
A crossover SUV is often defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction (as with passenger cars); however, the designations are increasingly blurred because of the capabilities of the vehicles, the labelling by marketers, and electrification of new models.
The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s, and the four-wheel-drive station wagons and carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949.
Some SUVs produced today use unibody construction; however, in the past, more SUVs used body-on-frame construction.
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the popularity of SUVs greatly increased, often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons.
SUVs accounted for 45.9% of the world's passenger car market in 2021.
SUVs have been criticized for a variety of environmental and safety-related reasons.
They generally have poorer fuel efficiency and require more resources to manufacture than smaller vehicles, contributing more to climate change and environmental degradation.
Between 2010 and 2018 SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the global increase in carbon emissions worldwide.
Their higher center of gravity increases their risk of rollovers.
Their higher front-end profile makes them at least twice as likely to kill pedestrians they hit.
Additionally, the psychological sense of security they provide influences drivers to drive less cautiously.
There is no universally accepted definition of the sport utility vehicle.
Dictionaries, automotive experts, and journalists use varying wordings and defining characteristics, in addition to regional variations of usage by both the media and the general public.
The auto industry also has not settled on one definition of the SUV.
The actual term "Sport Utility Vehicle" did not come into wide popular usage until the late 1980s.
Before then, such vehicles were marketed as four-wheel drives, jeeps, station wagons, or other terms.
Automotive websites' descriptions of SUVs range from specifically "combining car-like appointments and wagon practicality with steadfast off-road capability" with "chair-height seats and picture-window visibility" to the more general "nearly anything with available all-wheel drive and raised ground clearance".
It is also suggested that the term "SUV" has replaced "jeep" as a general term for off-road vehicles.
In Europe, the term SUV is generally used for road-oriented vehicles, described as "J-segment" by the European Commission.
"Four-by-four" or the brand name of the vehicle is typically used for off-road-oriented vehicles.
Similarly, in New Zealand, vehicles designed for off-road use are typically referred to as "four-wheel drives" instead of SUVs.
In the United States, many government regulations simply have categories for "off-highway vehicles" which are loosely defined and often result in SUVs (along with pick-up trucks and minivans) being classified as light trucks.
For example, corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) regulations previously included "permit greater cargo-carrying capacity than passenger carrying volume" in the definition for trucks, resulting in cars with removable rear seats, like the PT Cruiser, being classified as light trucks.
This classification as trucks allowed SUVs to be regulated less strictly than passenger cars under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act for fuel economy, and the Clean Air Act for emissions.
However, from 2004 onwards, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began to hold sport utility vehicles to the same tailpipe emissions standards as cars for criteria pollutants, though not greenhouse gas emissions standards as they were not set until 2010.
In 2011, the CAFE regulations were changed to classify small, two-wheel-drive SUVs as passenger cars.
However, the licensing and traffic enforcement regulations in the United States vary from state to state, and an SUV may be classified as a car in some states but as a truck in others.
For industry production statistics, SUVs are counted in the light truck product segment.
In India, all SUVs are classified in the "Utility Vehicle" category per the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) definitions and carry a 27% excise tax.
Those that are 4 metres (13 feet) long, have a 1,500 cc (92 cu in) engine or larger, along with 170 mm (6.7 in) of ground clearance, are subject to a 30% excise duty.
In Australia, SUV sales were helped by having lower import duties than passenger cars.
Up until January 2010, SUVs were subject to a 5% import tariff, compared with 10% for passenger cars.
In February 2024, voters in Paris mandated a triple parking charge rate for SUVs, citing environmental impact and street capacity; this followed similar decisions in Lyon and Tübingen with similar ordinances being considered by London, Brussels and Amsterdam.
Many years after most passenger cars had transitioned to unibody construction, most SUVs continued to use a separate body-on-frame method, due to being based on the chassis from a light truck, commercial vehicle, pickup truck, or off-road vehicle.
The first mass-produced unibody four-wheel-drive passenger car was the Russian 1955 GAZ-M20 Pobeda M-72, which could be considered the first crossover car.
The 1977 Lada Niva was the first off-road vehicle to use both a unibody construction and a coil-sprung independent front suspension.
The relatively compact Niva is considered a predecessor to the crossover SUV and combines a hatchback-like passenger car body with full-time four-wheel drive, low-range gearing, and lockable center differential.
Nonetheless, unibody SUVs remained rare until the 1984 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) was introduced and became a sales success.
The introduction of the 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee resulted in all Jeep SUV models using unibody construction, with many other brands following suit since the mid-1990s.
Today, most SUVs in production use a unibody construction and relatively few models continue to use body-on-frame construction.
SUVs are typically of a two-box design similar to a station wagon.
The engine compartment is in the front, followed by a combined passenger/cargo area (unlike a sedan, which has a separate trunk/boot compartment).
Up until approximately 2010, many SUV models were available in two-door body styles.
Since then, manufacturers began to discontinue the two-door models as the four-door models became more popular.
A few two-door SUVs remain available, such as the body-on-frame Suzuki Jimny, Mahindra Thar, Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, Ford Bronco, and Jeep Wrangler as well as the Range Rover Evoque crossover SUV.
SUVs typically have high ground clearance and a tall body.
This results in a high center of mass, which made SUVs more prone to roll-over accidents.
In 2003, SUVs were quoted as 2.5 times more likely to roll over in a crash than regular cars and that SUV roofs were more likely to cave in on passengers than in other cars, resulting in increased harm to passengers.
Between 1991 and 2001, the United States saw a 150% increase in sport-utility vehicle rollover deaths.
In 2001, though roll-overs constituted just 3% of vehicle crashes overall, they caused over 30% of occupant fatalities in crashes; and in crashes where the vehicle did roll over, SUV occupants in the early 2000s were nearly three times as likely to be killed as other car passengers.
Vehicles with a high center of gravity do sometimes fail the moose test of maneuverability conducted by Swedish consumer magazine Teknikens Värld, for example, the 1997 Mercedes-Benz A-Class and 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
The increasing popularity of SUVs in the 1990s and early 2000s was partly due to buyers perceiving that SUVs provide greater safety for occupants, due to their larger size and raised ride height.
Regarding the safety of other road users, SUVs are exempted from U.S. regulation stating that a passenger car bumper must protect the area between 16 and 20 inches (41 and 51 cm) above the ground.
This often increases the damage to the other car in a collision with an SUV, because the impact occurs at a higher location on the other car.
In 2000–2001, 60% of fatal side-impact collisions were where the other vehicle was an SUV, an increase from 30% in 1980–1981.
The high danger for cyclists and pedestrians of being seriously injured or even killed by SUV drivers has caused some public protests against SUVs in urban areas.
In 2020, a study by the U.S.-based IIHS found that, of a sample of 79 crashes from three urban areas in Michigan, SUVs caused more serious injuries compared to cars when impacts occurred at greater than 31 km/h (19 mph).
The IIHS noted the sample size of the study was small and that more research is needed.
The popularity of SUVs contributed to an increase in pedestrian fatalities in the U.S. during the 2010s, alongside other factors such as distracted and drunk driving.
A 2021 study by the University of Illinois Springfield showed that SUVs are 8 times more likely to kill children in a collision than passenger cars, and multiple times more lethal to adult pedestrians and cyclists.
SUVs generally have poorer fuel efficiency than smaller cars, and thus contribute more to environmental degradation and global warming.
SUVs emit about 700 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per year, a gas that is linked to global warming.
According to the International Energy Agency, from 2010 SUVs have been the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions, second only to the power sector.
SUVs were responsible for all of the 3.3 million barrels a day growth in oil demand from passenger cars between 2010 and 2018, whereas efficiency improvements in smaller cars saved over 2 million barrels a day, with electric cars reducing oil demand by under 100,000 barrels a day.
Whereas SUVs can be electrified, or converted to run on a variety of alternative fuels, including hydrogen, their (manufacturing) emissions will always be larger than smaller electric cars.
On average, SUVs consume about a quarter more energy than medium-size cars.
Furthermore, the vast majority of these vehicles are not converted to use alternative fuels.
Between 2010 and 2018 SUVs were the second largest contributor to the global increase in carbon emissions worldwide.
The "crossover SUV" segment (also known as "CUVs" or simply "crossovers") has become increasingly popular since around 2010.
Crossovers are often based on a platform shared with a passenger car, as a result, they typically have better comfort and fuel economy, but less off-road capability (many crossovers are sold without all-wheel drive) than pickup truck-based SUVs.
The difference between crossovers and other SUVs is sometimes defined as a crossover being built using a unibody platform (the type used by most passenger cars), while an SUV is built using a body-on-frame platform (the type used by off-road vehicles and light trucks).
However, these definitions are often blurred in practice, since unibody vehicles are also often referred to as SUVs.
Also, crossover is a relatively recent term and early unibody SUVs (such as the 1984 Jeep Cherokee) are rarely called crossovers.
Due to these inconsistencies, the term SUV is often used as a catch-all for both crossovers and SUVs.
Outside of the United States, the term crossover tends to be used for C-segment (compact) or smaller vehicles, with large unibody vehicles—such as the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class, BMW X7, and Range Rover—usually referred to as SUVs rather than crossovers.
In the United Kingdom, a crossover is sometimes defined as a hatchback model with raised ride height and SUV-like styling features.
The smallest size class of SUVs is the "mini SUV".
In Japan, SUVs under 3,400 mm (133.9 in)—such as the Mitsubishi Pajero Mini—are included in the kei car category and therefore attract lower taxes.
Many recent vehicles labeled as mini SUVs are technically subcompact crossovers and are built on the platform of a subcompact (also called supermini or B-segment) passenger car.
The "compact SUV" is the next bigger-size class after mini SUVs.
Many recent vehicles labeled as compact SUVs are technically compact crossovers and are built on the platform of a compact (C-segment) passenger car.
The next larger size is called the "mid-size SUV".
Some mid-size SUVs are based on platforms shared with passenger cars and therefore, are crossovers.
Other mid-size SUVs are based on compact or mid-size pickups.
Full-size SUVs are the largest size of commonly produced SUVs.
Some, such as the Ford Expedition, and Chevrolet Tahoe, are marketed for their off-road capabilities, and others, such as the Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade, are marketed as luxury vehicles.
While a few full-size SUVs are built on dedicated platforms; most share their platforms with full-size pickup trucks.
Some North American SUVs are available as a long-bodied version of a full-size SUV, which is called an "extended-length SUV" like the Ford Expedition EL and the Chevrolet Suburban.
The additional length is used to provide extra space for rear passengers or cargo.
As per the full-size SUVs they are based on, most extended-length SUVs are built on dedicated platforms, full-sized pickups (1⁄2 ton), or heavy-duty pickups (3⁄4 ton or more).
Extended-length SUVs are mostly sold in North America but may also be exported to other markets in small numbers.
Some SUVs or crossovers with sloping rear rooflines are marketed as "coupe crossover SUVs" or "coupe SUVs", even though they have four side doors for passenger access to the seats and rear hatches for cargo area access.
Just before and during World War II, prototypes and low-volume production examples of military cars with sedan or station wagon-type bodies and rugged, off-road capable four-wheel drive chassis began to appear around the world.
These early models included the 1936 Kurogane Type 95 from Japan, the 1938 GAZ-61 from Russia as well as the 1941 Volkswagen Kommandeurswagen and 1936 Opel Geländesportwagen from Germany.
An early predecessor to the design of modern SUVs was the 1940 Humber Heavy Utility, a four-wheel-drive off-road vehicle built on the chassis of the Humber Super Snipe passenger car.
The most prohibitive initial factors to the potential civilian popularity of an SUV-like car were their cost and the availability of certain critical parts.
Before the war, adding four-wheel drive to a car almost doubled its cost.
Compared to a common, rear-wheel drive vehicle, any 4WD (four-wheel drive) needed many essential extra components, including a transfer case, a second differential, and constant-velocity joints for the driven front axle—which were expensive due to the precision involved in this required manufacturing gears and other specialized parts.
Before World War II, these were produced in the United States by only a few specialized firms with limited production capacity.
Due to the increase in demand for parts for the war effort, in the spring of 1942 Ford, Dodge, and Chevrolet joined in fabricating these parts in mass quantities, boosting their production more than 100-fold.
An early usage of the term was the 1947 Crosley CC Four Sport Utility model, which used a convertible wagon body style and is therefore unrelated to the design of later SUVs.
Several models of carryall wagons began to be offered with four-wheel drive, beginning in 1949 when the Willys Jeep Station Wagon introduced the option of four-wheel drive.
Four-wheel-drive versions of the Chevrolet Suburban were introduced for 1955, followed by the International Harvester Travelall in 1956 (credited as being the first full-size SUV) and the Power Wagon Town Wagon in 1957.
Developed as a competitor to the Jeep CJ, the compact International Scout was introduced in 1961, offering either two- or four-wheel drive and a variety of engine options.
The Harvester Scout provided many other options designed to appeal to a wide range of customers for numerous uses as well.
The 1963 Jeep Wagoneer (SJ) introduced a sophisticated station wagon body design that was more carlike than any other four-wheel-drive vehicle on the market.
The 1967 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ55 station wagon was the first comfort-oriented version of the Land Cruiser off-road vehicle.
The two-door Chevrolet K5 Blazer (and related GMC K5 Jimmy) were introduced for 1969, and the two-door International Scout II was introduced in 1971.
The first European luxury off-road vehicle was the 1970 Range Rover Classic, which was marketed as a luxury car for both on-road and off-road usage.
In 1972 Subaru Leone 4WD wagon was introduced in Japan, which was not designed as an off-road vehicle, but a version of the front-wheel-drive passenger car.
Some argue that this was the first SUV.
It was also classified as a commercial vehicle in the home market, just like later SUVs.
The first relevant usage of the term SUV was in advertising brochures for the full-sized 1974 Jeep Cherokee (SJ), which used the wording "sport(s) utility vehicle" as a description for the vehicle.
The 1966 Ford Bronco included a "sport utility" model; however, in this case it was used for the two-door pickup truck version.
The VAZ-2121 (now designated Lada Niva Legend) was the first mass-market 4WD unibody car in some markets in 1977.
The AMC Eagle introduced in the North American market in 1979, and is often called the first mass-market "crossover", although that term had not been coined at the time.
In contrast to truck or utility-vehicle based designs and the Niva that was purpose-built for rural areas, American Motors Corporation (AMC) utilized a long-serving existing car platform and designed a new automatic full-time AWD system.
The AMC Eagle was developed as a passenger car offering numerous comfort, luxury, and convenience features in sedan, coupe, and station wagon body styles.
It was first with "SUV styling on a raised passenger-car platform combined with AWD."
Four Wheeler magazine described the AMC Eagle as "the beginning of a new generation of cars".
The U.S. corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard was introduced in 1975 to reduce fuel usage, but included relaxed regulations for "light trucks" to avoid businesses paying extra taxes for work vehicles.
This created a loophole that manufacturers increasingly exploited since the 1980s oil glut (which started an era of cheap gasoline), whereby SUVs were designed to be classified as light trucks despite their primary use as passenger vehicles to receive tax concessions and less stringent fuel economy requirements.
This enabled manufacturers to sell more profitable, larger, more polluting vehicles, instead of the smaller, less polluting, less profitable cars, that the CAFE regulations intended.
For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency agreed to classify the new Jeep Cherokee as a light truck following lobbying from its manufacturer; the Cherokee was then marketed by the company as a passenger vehicle.
This increased the SUV boom as other manufacturers introduced their own SUVs in response to the compact Cherokee taking sales from their regular cars.
In 1994 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began classifying vehicles by "market class".
For SUVs in 1994 they included three Jeep models, the Cherokee, Grand Cherokee and Wrangler.
Two Ford models were the Bronco and the Explorer.
Six General Motors models including the GMC Jimmy, the Yukon, and the Suburban 1500; the Chevrolet Suburban 1500, and the Blazer (1500 and S10); the Geo Tracker (Convertible or Van); and finally the Oldsmobile Bravada.
Eleven Japanese models classified as SUVs were the Toyota 4Runner and Land Cruiser; the Honda Passport; the Nissan Pathfinder; the Mazda Navajo; the Mitsubishi Montero; the Isuzu Amigo, Rodeo, and Trooper; and the Suzuki Samurai and Sidekick.
From Europe the three Land Rover models, the Range Rover, the Defender and the Discovery were classified as SUVs.
By 2003, there were 76 million SUVs and light trucks on U.S. roads, representing approximately 35% of the vehicles on the road.
Car manufacturers were keen to promote SUV sales over other types of cars due to higher profits in the segment.
An SUV could be sold with a profit margin of US$10,000 or more (US$18,000 per SUV in the case of the Ford Excursion), while compact cars were often sold at a loss of a few hundred dollars per car.
As a result, several manufacturing plants were converted from car production to SUV production (such as the General Motors plant in Arlington, Texas in 1996), and many long-running U.S. sedan models were discontinued.
From the mid-2000s until 2010, U.S. sales of SUVs and other light trucks experienced a dip due to increasing fuel prices and then a declining economy.
From 2008 until 2010, General Motors closed four assembly plants that were producing SUVs and trucks.
Sales of SUVs and light trucks sales began to recover in 2010, as fuel prices decreased and the North American economy improved.
In 2019, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that the global number of SUVs and crossovers on the road multiplied by six since 2010—from 35 million to 200 million vehicles, and their market share has grown to 40 percent of worldwide new light-vehicle sales at the end of the decade.
By 2013, small and compact SUVs had increased to become the third-largest market segment.
Since the early 2000s, new versions have been introduced to appeal to a wider audience, such as crossovers and other small SUVs.
Larger SUVs also remained popular, with sales of General Motors' large SUV models increasing significantly in 2013.
In 2015, global sales of SUVs overtook the "lower medium car" segment, to become the largest market segment, accounting for 22.9% of "light vehicle" sales in 2015.
The following year, worldwide SUV sales experienced further growth of 22%.
The world's fastest-growing SUV markets in 2014–2015 were: China (+ 47.9%), Italy (+ 48.6%), Spain (+ 42%), Portugal (+ 54.8 %), and Thailand (+ 56.4%).
The SUV segment further grew to 26% of the global passenger car market in 2016, then to 36.8% of the market in Q1–Q3 of 2017.
In the U.S. at the end of 2016, sales of SUVs and light-duty trucks had surpassed traditional car sales for the year by over 3 million units.
Manufacturers continued to phase out the production of sedan models, replacing them with new models of SUVs.
Luxury brands have increasingly introduced SUV or crossover models in the 2010s.
For example: Rolls-Royce Cullinan, Bentley Bentayga, Aston Martin DBX, Maserati Levante, Lamborghini Urus, and Ferrari Purosangue.
In 2019 SUVs made up 47.4% of U.S. sales compared to only 22.1% for sedans.
SUVs have competed in various off-road racing competitions, such as the Dakar Rally, Baja 1000, FIA Cross-Country Rally World Cup, King of the Hammers, and Australasian Safari.
SUVs have also competed in the Trophee Andros ice-racing series.
Several derogatory or pejorative terms for SUVs are based on the combination of an affluent suburb name and "tractor", particularly for expensive vehicles from luxury brands.
Examples include "Toorak Tractor" (Melbourne, Australia), "Chelsea Tractor" (London, England) and "Remuera Tractor" (Auckland, New Zealand).
These terms relate to the theory that four-wheel drive capabilities are not required by affluent SUV owners, and that the SUV is purchased as a status symbol rather than for practical reasons.
In Norway, the term Børstraktor ('Stock Exchange Tractor') serves a similar purpose.
In the Netherlands, SUVs are sometimes called "P.C. Hooft-tractors" after the exclusive P.C.
Hooftstraat Amsterdam shopping street.
A commercial SUV is an SUV or crossover, that is used for commercial purposes.
The category is very similar to panel trucks since the Chevrolet Suburban (an SUV) had panel truck versions, which were used for commercial purposes.
The first SUV-like vehicle that had commercial versions was the Chevrolet Suburban panel truck.
Panel trucks by American manufacturers were built until the late 1970s.
While panel trucks manufactured by European manufacturers were rare, commercial versions of off-road vehicles were very common, Land Rover manufactured commercial versions of the Land Rover and the Defender.
Commercial SUVs are factory-built and most of them are not independent conversions, which means they can be bought from dealerships and showrooms.
Examples of SUVs used as commercial vehicles in Europe include: Citroen C5 Aircross Commercial SUV, the Land Rover Discovery, the Dacia Duster Flika, and the Mitsubishi Pajero.
A motor vehicle service or tune-up is a series of maintenance procedures carried out at a set time interval or after the vehicle has traveled a certain distance.
The service intervals are specified by the vehicle manufacturer in a service schedule and some modern cars display the due date for the next service electronically on the instrument panel.
A tune-up should not be confused with engine tuning, which is the modifying of an engine to perform better than the original specification, rather than using maintenance to keep the engine running as it should.
Inspection - vehicle components are visually inspected for wear or any leaks.
A diagnostic is performed to identify any electrical components reporting a failure or a part operating outside of normal conditions.
Replacement - Given certain lubricants break down over time due to heat and wear, manufacturers recommend replacement.
Any parts that are close to their expected failure are replaced too to avoid a failure while operating the vehicle.
Adjustments - as vehicle components wear, they may need adjustment over time.
Example: parking brake cable.
The completed services are usually recorded in a service book or digital service record upon completion of each service.
A digital service record is an online record of a vehicle's maintenance history.
A complete service history usually adds to the resale value of a vehicle.
Difference between major and full service: a major service is more comprehensive than a full service; although it covers all the same checks that a full service does, a major service will be more detailed and will include more replacements of wearable parts, such as pollen filters, and changing brake fluid if required.
As a guideline, minor car services are carried out every 10,000 to 15,000 kilometres (6,200 to 9,300 miles), and major car services every 30,000 to 45,000 kilometres (19,000 to 28,000 miles) – or every twelve months, whichever comes first.
Service advisers in dealerships and independent shops recommend schedule intervals, which are often in between the ideal or extreme service schedule.
In addition, drivers may be penalized for not regularly servicing their cars.
For example, in many states in the U.S., a car has to pass a safety inspection test every year or two years to remain legal, and can incur fines for continuing to drive cars that have failed.
Mechanical parts that may cause the car to cease transmission or prove unsafe for the road are also noted and advised upon.
Samuel Morey (October 23, 1762 – April 17, 1843) was an American inventor, who worked on early internal combustion engines and was a pioneer in steamships who accumulated a total of 20 patents.
The son of a Revolutionary War Officer.
He was the second of seven children born to Israel Morey (1735–1809) and Martha Palmer (1733–1810) and was born in Hebron, Connecticut, but moved to Orford, New Hampshire, with his family in 1768.
His father Israel Morey served in the colonial militia and rapidly rose from private to general.
Samuel Morey operated a successful lumber business in Orford and Fairlee, Vermont.
He died in 1843, and was buried in Orford.
Lake Morey in Vermont is named in his honor.
Morey's first patent, in 1793, was for a steam-powered spit, but he had grander plans.
Morey realized that steam could be a power source in the 1780s, and he probably appreciated a steamboat's potential from work on his father's ferry and the locks he designed along the Connecticut river.
In the early 1790s he fitted a paddle wheel and steam engine to a small boat and powered it up and down the Connecticut River.
Legend has it, this was done on a Sunday morning, when the town was at church, to avoid ridicule if he failed.
The most important aspect of this craft was the paddle wheel.
It was an old idea – supposedly dating to antiquities – and previously tried with a steam engine.
Jonathan Hulls of England used a rear-mounted paddle wheel in 1737 but an inefficient method of turning the steam engine's reciprocating motion into the circular motion hobbled it.
In 1789, Nathan Reed of Massachusetts experimented with a paddle wheel, and considered patenting it, but eventually patented a different method instead.
The American John Fitch experimented with side-mounted paddle wheels, but in 1791 used and patented oars instead.
Morey's may have been the first successful use of a steam power paddle wheel, which was the best method of propulsion until the propeller, invented by Fitch, was perfected.
Morey's first boat was little more than a proof of concept, so he built another in New York.
In a letter to New York legislator William Duer, Morey describes how over the next three summers he traveled down to New York, and the following summer to Hartford, Connecticut to improve and exhibit his boat.
Finally, in 1797 he went to Bordentown, New Jersey (a stop on Fitch's failed Philadelphia-to-Trenton passenger service), because it was “sickly in New York”, and built a boat employing two side-mounted paddle wheels.
At this point, Morey considered his boat ready for commercial use and sought financial backers.
For reasons that are unclear, his backing fell through because of “a series of misfortunes”.
This is likely the end of Morey's direct work with steamboats – although there are many tales of a later fourth steamboat– but not the end of his steam engine patents.
In addition to one received in 1795 for improvements he made working on the steam engine in boat, he received patents for other applications and improvements in 1799, 1800, and 1803.
Despite Morey's success in building a working steamboat, credit for the first successful steamboat line goes to Robert Fulton and his financier, Chancellor Robert Livingston.
This was a cause for contention, as Morey claims that they took some of his ideas.
His account, which seems more reasonable than later, derived accounts, is laid out in his letter to Duer and is as follows.
The summer after the one Morey spent at Hartford, he returned to New York and gave Livingston a ride in his boat (perhaps at the advice of Benjamin Silliman – publisher of Morey's papers – who knew Livingston to be a supporter of the arts).
He was impressed and offered Morey a “considerable sum” if he could improve the boat's speed to 8 miles per hour.
He also offered $7,000 for the rights to use his current work around New York  but Morey declined the offer.
However, he continued working towards Livingston's speed goal.
Morey had conversations with Fulton and Livingston, and Livingston even traveled to Orford to see him (although Morey doesn't say when or what was discussed).
Later, Morey reportedly was aboard Fulton's boat and expressed to Fulton his displeasure that his ideas had netted Fulton much but nothing for himself.
In 1815, Morey patented a “revolving” steam engine, described at length in the American Journal of Science in 1819 by John Sullivan, its purchaser.
With the exception of one harsh initial review predicting that it would barely work – which was rebuffed by Sullivan, it was apparently well received and Sullivan's description appeared in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal along with an introduction praising American steam engine and boat refinements.
Instead of a stationary cylinder driving a rod that turns a wheel through a second linkage, it seems that the cylinder is allowed to pivot as the rod moves, which then turns a crank.
The cylinder's pivot doubles as a valve that controls the direction and flow of steam according to its position.
The claimed advantages of this configuration are lightweight, high-speed operation, durable construction, and low cost.
This engine met with some commercial success; recorded applications include tugboats, a glass factory, and a sawmill in the Boston naval yard.
One tugboat even sailed to South Carolina, where its owner was pleased by its performance.
Morey received one more steam patent in 1817  but his interest had been captured by experiments with flammable vapors, which had started some time before.
His experiments are described at length over several articles in the American Journal of Science and Arts.
They are light on theory, and Silliman comments that “[Morey's] results are often very valuable, and perhaps, in some cases, not the less so, for having been sought without the direction of preconceived, theoretical views.”
This is mostly true; theory enters into these articles mostly for possible explanations.
However, in 1834, 15 years after his first publication on the subject, he proposes a theory of combustion that has electricity as its basic force.
Hints of this theory may be visible in his first paper, but his early experiments were not guided by it.
His first practical application was to heat water for his revolving engine.
He observed that passing steam over burning coal or tar caused the flames to burn brighter and without smoke, and he theorized that the steam was decomposed in this process.
Word of these experiments reached the eminent French chemist Gay-Lussac, and he commented on them in Annales de Chimie et de Physique in 1819.
He contended that the temperature was insufficient to cause decomposition.
Instead, the steam freed more flammable vapors in the fuel causing the flame's change.
Morey was correct.
He produced what is now known as town gas.
The oxygen from the water combines with carbon from the fuel to form carbon monoxide and the hydrogen forms a diatomic molecule.
Both later burn to form water and carbon dioxide.
Morey was not the first to use water-gas for lighting, and his devices, including the patented 1818 American Water Burner, simply used the gas immediately instead of piping it to be burnt elsewhere, done as early as 1792 in England.
Morey apparently did not know of this advance or at least did not recognize it as the same process.
Strangely, in 1819 J. F. Dana of Dartmouth and Harvard proposed attaching steam boilers to street lamps to take advantage of Morey's discovery, but water-gas was already being piped to some London street lamps from a central source in 1812.
Still, Morey's device did produce more light, and there is evidence that it resulted in more efficient combustion.
During his experiments, Morey discovered that the vapor of turpentine, when mixed with air, was explosive.
He recognized its potential, developed an engine, and wrote an unpublished description in 1824, which he modified in 1825 and 1826.
He finally published and patented the idea later in that year.
The revisions between the drafts are small, and deal mostly with reworking of the engine's valves.
The engine has much in common with modern ones.
It has two cylinders, a carburetor, a familiar arrangement of valves and cams.
However, unlike modern engines, and unlike the earlier 1807 François Isaac de Rivaz engine, the explosion did not directly provide power.
Instead, the explosion expelled air from the cylinder through a one-way valve.
The cylinder was cooled by a water jacket and water injected into the combustion chamber after it fired.
The cooling gasses caused a vacuum and atmospheric pressure drove the piston.
Morey did mention trying direct action, and elaborated on it in other descriptions.
However, his method was more complicated and possibly less efficient because it used more of the engine's stroke to draw in fuel.
Morey demonstrated his engine in New York and Philadelphia and there are eyewitness reports for both.
In Philadelphia, he demonstrated it powering a boat and a wagon.
Unfortunately, when he decided to demonstrate the car on the street, he fell off after starting the engine and the vehicle powered across Market Street into a ditch.
This was the second car ride in the world, and the first in the United States.
Despite these mostly successful demonstrations, Morey could not find a buyer, and became frustrated.
A letter from Reverend Dana of Orford written in October 1829 tells of Morey's trip to Baltimore, “I am told, the Capt. is determined to make one more vigorous effort, to sell his patent right for some of his modern inventions
[he later singles out the vapor engine], and if he does not now succeed, he will give the matter up, and return to Orford, to spend his days in quiet.”
Morey did not find a buyer, and as he was then in his late 60s, it made sense to stop traveling up and down the east coast and call it quits.
While the engine was state of the art, it was not novel in many respects.
Morey seemed aware of contemporary internal combustion work – Hardenberg, who wrote a book on Morey's engine, adeptly noted that in his 1825 draft Morey “stated that he named his invention ‘vapor engine, to distinguish it from the… gas engine.’”
However, Hardenberg concludes that Morey could only have known of three engines similar to his.
He never mentioned them, and Hardenberg concludes that they did not influence Morey.
His internal combustion engine is the first documented in the United States, and his use of liquid fuel and a heated surface carburetor was world's first.
Another interesting feature was the wire mesh used to prevent the combustion from reaching the carburetor.
This feature was reinvented and patented again in 1872 because the patent office had lost Morey’s patent in the 1836 patent office fire.
The lack of interest in his vapor engine is unfortunate, because the vapor engine was his most farsighted invention.
Morey notes in his unpublished 1824 draft that:Is there not some reason to expect that the discovery will greatly change the commercial and personal intercourse of the country.
There is good reason I trust to conclude that transportation on good roads or railroad may be done much cheaper as well as quicker than by locks and canals, besides having the great advantage of being done, much of it, in the winter a time much the most convenient of the farmer.
In their personal intercourse, if it should be generally thought most prudent to continue their intercourse on the earth’s surface, yet I think there will be little use of horses for that purpose.
He mentions "the earth's surface" because elsewhere he proposed using the engine to propel balloons.
Now that the internal combustion engine's potential has been realized, people often focus on his engine.
The first push to popularize his work was done by Charles Duryea, a fellow inventor who produced the first gasoline engine in America around 1890.
He funded the creation of two working replicas of Morey's Engine — one is in the possession of the Smithsonian and the other is owned by Dean Kamen — and posited that Morey's engine was a direct precursor of the modern engine, a position with which others disagree.
Recently, Morey's work has received renewed attention by people other than locals and engineers, in particular American comedian Jay Leno, who is an avid car collector.
Messrs. Rush and Muhlenburg:
Dear Sir: — Perhaps I ought to have written sooner, but with all my exertions, and they have been as important as they ever were with you, I could not perfect, to my mind, the application of the "new power" to a boat until within two weeks.
It will now run as regular as any that are driven with steam, and with very little expense.
The boat is about nine teen feet long, 5 \ wide and the engine occupies only about eighteen inches of the stern, and sometimes goes between 7 and 8 miles per hour.
The same engine may unquestionably, when in better hands, be made to drive one, properly constructed, of twice the capacity, at least ten.
Its application to stationary purposes I perfected last winter.
Throughout the whole time I have been constantly perfecting the engine.
I expect to leave here in two or three days for home to arrange my business for winter, and if possible to collect some money for you and Mr. Garrett, as well as some for myself, which I could do were there any in the country, as I have more than $3,000 of salable personal property and good debts.
But whether I get any or not, you may expect to see me next month, if I am alive and well as usual.
I have the engine already packed up to be put with the mails on board a Packet, as soon as I can get ready to start from home.
Have been inclined to think I should send it to Baltimore in the first instance, but shall postpone entirely anything further.
When I have the pleasure to see you I hope to learn what will be the best course to be taken.
It remains for me to have the engine applied to a carriage on a rail, road, and when that is done, I should think I have done my part.
I can but hope and trust the ensuing winter will see the engine well applied to a carriage on a railroad.
With sentiments of the greatest esteem and friendship, I am dear Sirs, as ever, Yours, SAM' MOREY.
Sept., 1829.
Captain Samuel Morey, a native of Connecticut, but a resident of Oxford, N. H., began his experiments in 1790, and that year propelled his boat by a stern wheel, from Hartford to New York City, at the rate of five miles an hour.
On her return trip from New York to Greenwich, Conn., she had as passengers Chancellor Livingston, Edward Livingston, John Stevens, of Hoboken, N. J., and others ; this was the sixth boat built in the United States.
In a letter written to William A. Duer, Esq., some years later, Captain Morey says : " As nearly as I can recollect, it was as early as 1790 that I turned my attention to improving the steam engine and in applying it to the purpose of propelling boats.
In June, 1797, I went to Bordentown, on the Delaware, and there constructed a steamboat and devised the plan of propelling by means of wheels on the side.
The shafts ran across the boat with a crank in the middle worked from the beam of the engine with a shackle-bar.
The boat was only exhibited in Philadelphia.
I took out patents for my improvements.
1 never had any doubt but that I had a right to take out a patent for the application of two wheels to a steamboat, and often told Mr. Fulton and Mr. Livingston that I had.
To the latter I once asserted this right when on board his steamboat with him."
Morey, like his predecessors, was prevented from continuing his experiments for lack of means.
Letter not found.
5 September 1802.
Acknowledged in Daniel Brent to Morey, 9 Oct. 1802 (DNA: RG 59, DL, vol.
Brent informed Morey that his letter had arrived in JM’s absence “and I have just received his directions, since his return, to forward the enclosed exemplification of the Patent alluded to, to you, and to return you fifty cents, and I herewith do so.”
Samuel Morey (1762–1843) was an inventor who held a number of patents, including a steam-operated spit (1793), a windmill (1796), a steam pump (1799), and the internal combustion engine (1826).
He began steamboat experiments in 1790 and was awarded a patent in 1803 for improvements on a steam engine.
In 2004, 10 of Morey's patents, including the one for the internal combustion engine, were "found" in the Dartmouth College archives.
In truth, they had never really been lost.
Morey holds the earliest patent for an internal-combustion engine.
Other patents include a steam-powered rotisserie.

A shaker scoop (sometimes called a shaker hood scoop or a shaker hood) is an automobile term for an air intake for combustion air that is mounted directly on top of the engine's air cleaner and protrudes through a hole in the hood.
Since it is fastened directly to the engine, it moves with the engine's movement and vibration on its mountings, thus the 'shaker' name.
Like all such scoops, its purpose is to increase performance by a 'ram air' effect, taking advantage of the vehicle's speed to deliver high pressure, cool air to the engine over a shorter, less restrictive flow path.
However, because engines draw air in hundreds of cubic feet per minute, scoops do not raise intake pressures significantly.
Additional claimed benefits of a shaker hood include elevation to prevent water from being drawn on flooded terrain, being a source of cooler, denser air, and having a more direct path to the engine's throttle plate.
Hot rod and drag race enthusiasts have modified automotive engines to increase power via supercharger forced induction since the 1920s; in some cases, a blower scoop is added to the top of the supercharger as an aid to air intake.
A vehicle also can be equipped with an aftermarket engine-mounted scoop that is mounted directly to the carburetor and protrudes through the hood, which is known as a carb scoop.
Carb scoops are sometimes mistaken for blower scoops, but the presence (or lack) of a belt to drive the supercharger is one way to distinguish these scoops.
Both carb and blower scoops are sometimes called bugcatchers.
Like the shaker scoop, both a blower scoop and a carb scoop will vibrate in response to engine motions because they are attached to the engine.
Some aftermarket scoops include butterfly valves, which act as secondary throttle bodies.
Larry Shinoda of Ford is credited with introducing the shaker hood scoop as a factory-fitted option and campaigning to make it functional, first available exclusively for the 1969 model year Mustang equipped with the 428 Cobra Jet engine; the option was expanded to other Ford Mustang engines for 1970 and imitated quickly by competitors Chrysler (1970 Plymouth 'cuda and Dodge Challenger) and Pontiac (19701⁄2 Firebird Trans Am, which used a backwards-facing scoop to draw air from the high-pressure area at the base of the windshield).
Some official Chrysler literature referred to this popular hood style as the "Incredible Quivering Exposed Cold Air Grabber".
This lengthy title has since been shortened by enthusiasts and collectors to the less tongue-twisting "shaker hood".
In the 2000s, factory-fitted shaker scoops were reintroduced with the Ford Mustang (2003 Mach 1) and Dodge Challenger (2014 "Shaker" package).
Shift-by-wire is an automotive concept or system that employs electrical or electronic connections that replace the mechanical connection between the driver's gearshift mechanism and the transmission.
Since becoming commercially available in 1996, shift-by-wire has been commonly used in automated manual transmission and has later been implemented in semi-automatic transmission and automatic transmission.
Dispensing with gearshift mechanical linkages has several advantages: it reduces complexity and simplifies assembly; reduces the force required to shift gears and allows it to be customized with haptic technology; allows for more interior design freedom in the placement of the gearshift mechanism; allows for automation of the engagement of the parking brake and other functions; reduces cabin noise by eliminating the acoustic linkage between the transmission and the gear shift; and by reducing floor openings it improves the crash behavior of the vehicle.
With a mechanical connection, the gearshift selector always matches the engaged transmission gear.
With shift-by-wire, safety mechanisms need to be put in place.
The system needs to block incorrect input and "guide" the gearshift back to a position that matches the state of the transmission in case of error.
Another solution is to separate the gearshift selector from the gear indicator, meaning the driver has to visually monitor which gear is actually engaged, for instance on a display.
Safety considerations require redundancy in the gearshift and transmission sensors and in the vehicle communication network.
A park by wire system engages the parking pawl of a transmission using electrical means, without the traditional mechanical system which involves linkages between the gear shifter and the transmission.
Park-by-wire can be considered a part of a shift by wire system, as it shifts the transmission into park mode.
The main components of a park by wire system include the driver interface which could be a lever, switch, or knob; an electronic control unit; and actuators which are capable of driving the parking pawl into and out of the locking position with the parking gear of the transmission.
Shooting-brake (alternately spelled shooting break: 20, 146 ) is  a car body style which originated in the 1890s from horse-drawn carriage origins.
The first automotive shooting brakes were manufactured in the early 1900s in the United Kingdom.
The vehicle style became popular in England during the 1920s and 1930s, and was produced by vehicle manufacturers or as conversions by coachbuilders.
The term was used in Britain interchangeably with "estate car" from the 1930s but has not been in general use for many years and has been more or less superseded by the latter term.
Since the 1960s, the term has evolved, describing cars combining elements of both station wagon and coupé body styles, with or without reference to the historical usage for shooting parties.
During the 1960s and early 1970s, several high-end European manufacturers produced two-door shooting brake versions of their sports cars.
Following a hiatus from the mid 1970s until the early 2010s, the shooting-brake body style entered a resurgence.
A horse-drawn shooting brake was a variation of the break (also spelled brake).
Originally built as a simple but heavy frame for breaking in young horses to drive, over time it became a gentleman-driven vehicle and was popular for such aristocratic sports as shooting parties.
Taking the design from the rear-loading horse-drawn sporting vehicle, the station wagon was born, retaining the term "shooting brake".
"A sleek wagon with two doors and sports-car panache, its image entangled with European aristocracy, fox hunts, and baying hounds".
"A cross between an estate and a coupé".
"Essentially a two-door station wagon".
An interchangeable term for estate car (station wagon).
In France, a station wagon is marketed as a break, once having been called a break de chasse, which translates as "hunting break".
In the early 1900s, the Scottish Albion Motors began producing shooting brake models, described in the weekly magazine The Commercial Motor as having "seats for eight persons as well as the driver, whilst four guns and a large supply of cartridges, provisions baskets and a good 'bag' can be carried."
The 1912 Hudson Model 33 was described in England as a shooting brake, on the basis that "it was also used to carry the beaters to and from the location of the shoot, and for bringing back the game shot".
Early motorized safari vehicles were described as shooting brakes with no windows or doors.
One such description read: "Instead roll-down canvas curtains were buttoned to the roof in the case of bad weather.
These cars were heavy and comfortable in good weather and allowed quick and silent exit as no shooting was permitted from the vehicles."
During the 1920s and 1930s, shooting brake vehicles were popular in England and were produced as shooting brakes from the factory or converted by coachbuilders.
The term "estate car" began to be used instead of shooting brake, as the use of the vehicle expanded from just shooting parties to other domestic uses including ferrying guests and their luggage to and from railway stations.
During the 1960s and early 1970s, several high-end European manufacturers produced two-door shooting brake versions of their sports cars, including the 1960 Sunbeam Alpine Shooting Brake and 1965 Aston Martin DB5 Shooting Brake.
The 1966 Sunbeam Alpine was a limited-production three-door variant of its two-door open sports car with leather interior and walnut trim, selling at a price double its open counterpart and marketed as a shooting brake.
The Aston Martin DB5, DB6, and DBS shooting brakes were custom manufactured by coachbuilder Harold Radford from 1965 until 1967.
A prototype DB5 shooting-brake was custom produced by the factory for David Brown, an avid hunter and dog owner, and a further 11-12 coupés were custom modified for Aston Martin by independent coachbuilder, Harold Radford.
In August 2019 a DB5 sold for a record $1.765m (£1.456m), making it the most valuable Shooting Brake bodied-car of any marque sold at auction.
In 1992, Aston Martin manufactured in-house a limited production shooting brake variant of its Virage/Vantage, including a four-door shooting brake.
Other cars combining elements of a wagon and coupé have been described but were never formally marketed as shooting brakes, including the Reliant Scimitar GTE (1968–1975), the Volvo P1800 ES (1972–1973), and the later 480 (1986–1995) – marketed as a coupé, and with a sporty, low nose featuring pop-up headlights, but with a distinctly estate-like rear body.
The 1998 BMW Z3 Coupé (plus associated M Coupé model) is also typically referred to as a shooting brake.
Mostly dormant since the mid-1970s, the shooting brake term was used in 2004 to describe the Chevrolet Nomad concept car.
The following year, the Audi Shooting Brake concept car debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show.
Several other cars have been described by journalists as shooting brakes, including 2005 Dodge Magnum Station Wagon, 2006 Renault Altica concept car, 2008 Mini Clubman, 2011 Fisker Surf concept car, and the 2011 Ferrari FF.
The first production model of the 21st century marketed as a shooting brake was the 2012 Mercedes Benz CLS-Class Shooting Brake (X218), which was previewed as the Shooting Brake concept car at Auto China.
This model has four passenger doors, which is at odds with some definitions of a shooting brake as having two doors.
In 2015, Mercedes-Benz added the smaller CLA-Class four-door shooting brake to the model range.
The 2018 Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo, along with the Volkswagen Arteon despite the Arteon having five doors, are both described by their manufacturer as shooting brakes.
The trend is to associate the shooting brake body style with "performance" and also making the cars "more practical" than a coupé.
The marketing descriptions have been further blurred between variations of the terms with names such as sports tourer, sportback, or "shooting break" as a way to differentiate from SUVs and reposition ordinary body styles with "sleeker lines" in the minds of consumers to "ooze sex appeal".
BMW unveiled the Concept Touring Coupé based on the Z4 at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este in 2023.
A scooter (motor scooter) is a  motorcycle with an underbone or step-through frame, a seat, a transmission that shifts without the operator having to operate a clutch lever, a platform for their feet, and with a method of operation that emphasizes comfort and fuel economy.
Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and motor scooters have been made since at least 1914.
More recently, scooters have evolved to include scooters exceeding 250cc classified as Maxi-scooters.
The global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the Vespa and Lambretta models in Italy.
These scooters were intended to provide economical personal transportation (engines from 50 to 150 cc or 3.1 to 9.2 cu in).
The original layout is still widely used in this application.
Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from 200 to 850 cc (12 to 52 cu in) have been developed for Western markets.
Scooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car.
Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper.
The term motor scooter is sometimes used to avoid confusion with kick scooter, but can then be confused with motorized scooter or e-scooter, a kick-scooter with an electric motor.
The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a motor scooter as a motorcycle similar to a kick scooter with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels.
The US Department of Transportation defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests and has a step-through architecture.
The classic scooter design features a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet.
This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems are attached to the rear axle or under the seat.
Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer retro models have an axle-mounted engine.
Modern scooters starting from the late-1980s generally use a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while older ones use a manual transmission with the gearshift and clutch control built into the left handlebar.
Scooters usually feature bodywork, including a front leg shield and body that conceals all or most of the mechanicals.
There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the front leg shield, or both.
Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50 cc (3.1 cu in) single-cylinder to 850 cc (52 cu in) twin-cylinder models.
Traditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and rear.
Some scooters carry a spare wheel.
Many recent scooters use conventional front forks with the front axle fastened at both ends.
Some jurisdictions do not differentiate between scooters and motorcycles.
Though some jurisdictions classify smaller engine scooters (typically 50 cc or 3.1 cu in maximum) as moped class vehicles rather than motorcycles, meaning these scooters often have less stringent regulations (for example, 50 cc scooters can be driven with a normal car drivers license - or by adults aged 18+ years without any license (other than a valid liability insurance) at all as in case of at least Denmark - in many jurisdictions, and might pay less road-tax and be subject to less stringent roadworthiness testing).
For all legal purposes in the United States of America, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends using the term motorcycle for all of these vehicles.
However, while NHTSA excludes the term motor scooter from legal definition, it proceeds, in the same document, to give detailed instructions on how to import a small motor scooter.
Motorcycle: a motorcycle is any 2- or 3-wheeled gas operated vehicle weighing under 1,500 lbs.
with an engine displacement greater than or equal to 150ccs.
Operation requires an M1 class license, and such vehicles must be registered with the state and carry mandatory insurance as well as bear a motorcycle license plate.
Motorcycles may travel on any public roadway, including freeways, and may carry a single passenger in addition to the driver.
Helmets are mandatory.
Motor-driven cycle: a motor-driven cycle is 2-wheeled gas operated vehicle with an engine displacement of 149ccs or less that does not qualify as a moped (see below) and is capable of traveling greater than 30 mph.
It has the same licensing, registration, insurance, license plating, and helmet requirements as a motorcycle, though it may not travel on freeways.
Such vehicles are commonly referred to as "scooters".
Moped: a moped (or "motorized bicycle") is a 2- or 3-wheeled device with an automatic transmission capable of traveling no more than 30 mph, with either a gas engine displacement of less than 50ccs (i.e., 49ccs or less) with built-in pedals like a bicycle for human operation, OR, if powered only by electricity, it must not produce more than four gross brake horsepower (bicycle pedals are optional for electric mopeds).
There are no registration or insurance requirements for the device, but the operator themself must have an M1 or M2 class license and must personally carry the minimum state automobile insurance and the moped itself must bear a special moped license plate.
A single passenger is permitted if the vehicle is fitted with a specific seat and footrests for same.
Motorized tricycle/quadricycle: a motorized tricycle or quadricycle is a 3- or 4-wheeled vehicle propelled by a gas motor not capable of traveling greater than 30 mph and with a gross brake horsepower of 2 or less.
Motorized scooter: a motorized scooter is a 2-wheeled vehicle not capable of traveling greater than 15 mph with a floorboard designed to be stood upon while operating.
They do not require a license plate or insurance, and may not be driven on a roadway with a posted speed limit greater than 25 mph.
A valid class C driver license is required, as is a bicycle helmet.
Passengers are prohibited.
They may be operated on a bikepath or bikeway but not on a sidewalk.
If a given roadway has a bicycle lane, the motorized scooter must travel within it, and can only make a left-hand turn by dismounting and crossing an intersection as a pedestrian.
Electric bicycle:
California recognizes three classes of electric bicycles.
A class 1 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose electric motor only assists the rider when using the pedals and stops assisting when the bicycle reaches 20 mph; a class 2 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose motor can drive the bicycle entirely on its own, but will not assist the rider above 20 mph; a class 3 electric bicycle is identical to a class 1 electric bicycle, but is capable of traveling up 28 mph before the engine stops assisting the rider AND is equipped with a speedometer.
No electric bicycle requires insurance, a license, or any form of registration or license plate as it is not considered a "motor vehicle" by the state.
The emissions of mopeds and scooters have been the subject of multiple studies.
Studies have found that two-stroke 50 cc mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emit ten to thirty times more hydrocarbons and particulate emissions than the outdated Euro 3 automobile standards.
In the same study, four-stroke mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emitted three to eight times more hydrocarbons and particulate emissions than the Euro 3 automobile standards.
Approximate parity with automobiles was achieved with NOx emissions in these studies.
Emissions performance was tested on a g/km basis and was unaffected by fuel economy.
In 2011 the United States Environmental Protection Agency allowed motorcycles, scooters, and mopeds with engine displacements less than 280 cc to emit ten times the NOx and six times the CO than the median Tier II bin 5 automobile regulations.
An additional air quality challenge can also arise from the use of moped and scooter transportation over automobiles, as a higher density of two-wheeled vehicles can be supported by existing transportation infrastructure.
In Genoa, 2-stroke engine scooters made before 1999 are banned since 2019.
In some cities, such as Shanghai, petrol scooters/mopeds are banned and only LPG or electric scooters are allowed to be used in the city due to air pollution.
Scooter-like traits began to develop in motorcycle designs around the 1900s.
In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller in Munich, Germany produced the first motorcycle that was available for purchase.
Their motorcycle had a step-through frame, with its fuel tank mounted on the down tube, its parallel two-cylinder engine mounted low on the frame, and its cylinders mounted in line with the frame.
It was water-cooled and had a radiator built into the top of the rear fender.
It became the first mass-produced and publicly sold powered two-wheel vehicle, and among the first powered mainly by its engine rather than foot pedals.
Maximum speed was 40 km/h (25 mph).
The rear wheel was driven directly by rods from the pistons in a manner similar to the drive wheels of steam locomotives.
Only a few hundred such bikes were built, and the high price and technical difficulties made the venture a financial failure for both Wolfmüller and his financial backer, Hildebrand.
In France, the Auto-Fauteuil was introduced in 1902.
This was basically a step-through motorcycle with an armchair instead of a traditional saddle.
Production continued until 1922.
The motoped entered production in 1915, and is believed to be the first motor scooter.
They were followed that year by the Autoped, whose engine was engaged by pushing the handlebar column forward and whose brake was engaged by pulling the column back.
Autopeds were made in Long Island, New York from 1915 to 1921, and were also made under license by Krupp in Germany from 1919 to 1922, following
World War I.
The number of scooter manufacturers and designs increased after World War I.
The British - ABC Motors Skootamota, the Kenilworth, and the Reynolds Runabout debuted in 1919, with Gloucestershire Aircraft Company following with its Unibus in 1920.
The Skootamota was noted for being practical, popular, and economical, the Kenilworth for its electric lights, and the Reynolds Runabout for its advanced specifications, including front suspension, a two-speed gearbox, leg shields, and a seat sprung with leaf springs and coil springs.
The Unibus also had a two-speed gearbox, but it is more notable for its full bodywork, similar to that which would appear of second- and third-generation scooters.
The reputation of first-generation scooters was damaged by a glut of unstable machines with flexible frames, and more substantial examples like the Reynolds Runabout and the Unibus were too expensive to be competitive.
The first generation had ended by the mid-1920s.
E. Foster Salsbury and Austin Elmore developed the Salsbury Motor Glide, which was a division of Northrop Aircraft, a scooter with a seat above an enclosed drivetrain, and began production in 1936 in California.
In 1938, Salsbury introduced a more powerful scooter with a continuously variable transmission (CVT).
This was the first use of a CVT on a scooter.
It was such a success that Salsbury attempted to license the design to several European manufacturers including Piaggio.
The Motor Glide set the standards for all later models.
It inspired production of motor scooters by Powell, Moto-scoot, Cushman, Rock-Ola, and others.
The Cushman Company produced motor scooters from 1936 to 1965.
Cushman was an engine manufacturer that started making scooters after Salsbury found their offer to supply engines to be unacceptable.
Cushman and Salsbury competed against each other, with both companies advertising the economy of their scooters.
Cushman claimed an efficiency of 120 mpg‑US (2.0 L/100 km; 140 mpg‑imp) at 30 mph (48 km/h).
Cushman introduced a centrifugal clutch to their scooters in 1940.
The Cushman Auto Glide Model 53 was designed to be dropped by parachute with Army Airborne troops, and was eventually called the "Cushman Airborne".
Cushman scooters were also used around military bases for messenger service.
Salsbury continued manufacturing scooters until 1948, while Cushman continued until 1965.
Small numbers of the 165 cc (10.1 cu in) Harley-Davidson Topper scooter were produced from 1960 to 1965 using the engine from their line of light motorcycles based on the DKW RT 125.
It had a fiberglass body, a continuously variable transmission, and a pull-cord starting mechanism.
After World War II, wartime aircraft manufacturers were forbidden from making aircraft, and had to find other products to make in order to stay in business.
Fuji Sangyo, a part of the former Nakajima Aircraft Company, began production of the Fuji Rabbit S-1 scooter in June 1946.
Inspired by Powell scooters used by American servicemen, the S1 was designed to use surplus military parts, including the tailwheel of a Nakajima bomber, re-purposed as the front wheel of the S1.
Later that year, Mitsubishi introduced the C10, the first of its line of Silver Pigeon scooters.
This was inspired by a Salsbury Motor Glide that had been brought to Japan by a Japanese man who had lived in the United States.
Production of the Mitsubishi Silver Pigeon and the Fuji Rabbit continued through several series until the 1960s.
Some series of the Fuji Rabbit were developed to a high level of technological content; the S-601 Rabbit Superflow had an automatic transmission with a torque converter, an electric starter, and pneumatic suspension.
Mitsubishi ended scooter production with the C140 Silver Pigeon, while Fuji continued production of the Rabbit until the last of the S-211 series was built in June 1968.
In post-World War II Italy the Piaggio Vespa became the standard for scooters, and has remained so for over 60 years.
Patented in April 1946, it used aircraft design and materials.
D'Ascanio's 98 cc (6.0 cu in) scooter had various new design concepts, including a stress-bearing structure.
The gear shift lever was moved to the handlebars for easier riding.
The engine was placed near the rear wheel, eliminating the belt drive.
The typical fork support was replaced by an arm similar to an aircraft carriage for easier tire-changing.
The body design protected the driver from wind and road dirt.
The smaller wheels and shorter wheelbase provide improved maneuverability through narrow streets and congested traffic.
The name originated when Piaggio's president, upon seeing the prototype, remarked "Sembra una vespa", "It looks like a wasp".
Months after the Vespa, in 1947, Innocenti introduced the Lambretta, beginning a rivalry with Vespa.
The scooter was designed by Innocenti, his General Director Giuseppe Lauro and engineer Pierluigi Torre.
The Lambretta was named after Lambrate, the Milanese neighborhood where the factory stood.
It debuted in 1947 at the Paris Motor Show.
The Lambretta 'A' went on sale on December 23, 1947, and sold 9,000 units in one year.
It was efficient, at a time when fuel was severely rationed.
It had a top speed of 45 mph (72 km/h) from a fan-cooled engine of 123 cc (7.5 cu in).
The first Lambretta designs had shaft drive and no rear suspension, later designs used various drive and suspension systems until Lambretta settled on a swingarm-mounted engine with chain drive.
Also other Italian firms manufactured scooters in 1950s and 1960s, like Italjet and Iso.
Germany's aviation industry was also dismantled after World War II.
Heinkel stayed in business by making bicycles and mopeds, while Messerschmitt made sewing machines and automobile parts.
Messerschmitt took over the German license to manufacture Vespa scooters from Hoffman in 1954 and built Vespas under from 1954 to 1964.
Heinkel designed and built its own scooters.
The Heinkel Tourist was a large and relatively heavy touring scooter produced in the 1960s.
It provided good weather protection with a full fairing, and the front wheel turned under a fixed nose extension.
It had effective streamlining, perhaps thanks to its aircraft ancestry.
Although it had only a 175 cc (10.7 cu in) four stroke motor, it could sustain speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h).
Heinkel scooters were known for their reliability.
Glas, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, made the Goggo scooter from 1951 to 1955.
Glas discontinued scooter production to concentrate on its Goggomobil microcar.
Several manufacturers in the German motorcycle industry made scooters.
NSU made Lambrettas under license from 1950 to 1955, during which they developed their Prima scooter.
Production of the Prima began when NSU's license to build Lambrettas ran out.
Zündapp made the popular Bella scooter in the 1950s and 1960s.
It was in production for about ten years, in three engine sizes, 150 cc (9.2 cu in), 175 cc (10.7 cu in) and 200 cc (12 cu in).
They could perform all day at a steady speed of 60 mph (97 km/h).
Extremely reliable and very well made, many of these scooters still exist today.
Maico built the large Maicoletta scooter in the 1950s.
It had a single cylinder piston-port two-stroke engine, with four foot-operated gears and centrifugal fan cooling.
The Maicoletta had a choice of engine sizes, approximately 175 cc (10.7 cu in), 250 cc (15 cu in), or 275 cc (16.8 cu in), The tubular frame was built on motorcycle principles, with long-travel telescopic forks and 14-inch (356 mm) wheels.
The Maicoletta had a top speed of 70 mph (110 km/h) which was comparable with most 250 cc (15 cu in) motorcycles of the time.
Other German scooters made by motorcycle manufacturers included the DKW Hobby, the Dürkopp Diana, and the TWN Contessa.
In the United Kingdom, Douglas manufactured the Vespa under license from 1951 to 1961 and assembled them from 1961 to 1965.
BSA and Triumph made several models of scooter including the BSA Dandy 70, the Triumph Tina, and the Triumph Tigress.
The Tigress was made from 1959 to 1964 and was sold with a 175 cc 2-stroke single engine or a 250 cc 4-stroke twin; both versions used a foot-operated four-speed gearbox.
The 250 twin had a top speed of 70 mph (110 km/h).
The BSA Sunbeam was a badge engineered version of the Tigress.
The early 2000's saw the small scale production of the Scomadi scooter, a retro styled UK designed and manufactured scooter.
Scomadis were styled after classic Lambrettas.
A number of different models at different capacity was produced.
Production was later moved to Thailand.
In Eastern Bloc countries scooters also became popular in the second half of 1950s, but their production was a result of planned economy rather than market competition.
The Soviet Union started in 1957 with producing reverse engineered copies of 150 cc Vespa and 200 cc Glas Goggo as Vyatka and Tula T-200 respectively.
They and their developments were manufactured in big numbers into the 1980s.
In East Germany, IWL manufactured several own design 125 cc and 150 cc scooters (most notably SR 59 Berlin) from 1955 to 1964, when the authorities decided to switch the production to trucks.
There were also produced small 50 cc Simson scooters, manufactured into the 1990s.
From 1959 until 1965 there was produced the only Polish scooter, 150 cc to 175 cc WFM Osa.
In Czechoslovakia, there was produced a unique 175 cc scooter Čezeta at the outbreak of 1950s/1960s, then there remained only small 50 cc Jawa scooter-style mopeds.
Scooters are responsible for about 70 percent of India's gasoline consumption and the cost of a 100-kilometer ride is approximately 100 rupees ($1.30).
Electric scooters are just one percent of all scooters, but this number is expected to increase to  74 percent of all scooters sold in India by 2040.
The cost of operating an electric scooter is a sixth of the cost of a gasoline version.
API were the first scooter manufacturers in India, with a Lambretta model in the 1950s.
Bajaj Auto manufactured its line of scooters from 1972 to 2009, which included the Chetak, Legend, Super and Priya.
The Chetak and Legend were based on the Italian Vespa Sprint.
It was discontinued in 2009.
Another Vespa partner in India was LML Motors.
Beginning as a joint-venture with Piaggio in 1983, LML, in addition to being a large parts supplier for Piaggio, produced the P-Series scooters for the Indian market.
In 1999, after protracted dispute with Piaggio, LML bought back Piaggio's stake in the company and the partnership ceased.
LML continues to produce (and also exports) the P-Series variant known as the Stella in the U.S. market and by other names in different markets.
Since the 1980s Japan, and latterly China and Taiwan, have become world leaders in the mass production of plastic bodied scooters, most often with "twist-and-go" type transmissions (where gear selection and clutch operation are fully automatic).
A popular early model being the Honda Spree/Nifty Fifty.
Advertising campaigns in the USA featured popular stars like Michael Jackson (Suzuki), and Grace Jones and Lou Reed (Honda), and sales of Japanese scooters peaked there in the 1980s.
Both 2-stroke and 4-stroke plastic bodied scooters have been mass-produced in East Asia, with engine and transmission designs being either local designs or license built versions of European engines (eg Minarelli or Morini).
A popular 4-stroke engine in Chinese production is the GY6 engine, but electric motor-scooters are constantly increasing in the Chinese home market share.
Unlike other countries, Australia had no major motorcycle companies, nor scooter manufacturers in the original hey day of scooters in the 1950s and 1960s.
Scooters were mostly traditionally imported from Italy, and then in the 1970s and 1980s, from Japan and Asia.
Australian scooters have only appeared in the last 20 years or so, and many of them relating to the recent advent and viability of the electric engine.
Australian scooter companies design, market and manage the company from Australia, but manufacturing is largely done in Asia, with some assembly in Australia.
The oldest scooter company in Australia is Vmoto, a Perth based company that started off importing and distributing scooters, but then started to manufacture its own electric scooters.
Sydney based Hunted Scooters producers smaller numbers of niche petrol scooters, based on the customised Honda Ruckus scooters in Japan.
More recently Sydney based Fonz Moto produce electric scooters and electric motorbikes, assembled in Australia, using overseas and Australian sourced components.
Trends around the world have seen new developments of the classic scooter, some with larger engines and tires.
High-end scooter models now include comprehensive technological features, including cast aluminium frames, engines with integral counterbalancing, and cross-linked brake systems.
Some of these scooters have comfort features such as an alarm, start button, radio, windshield, heated hand grips and full instrumentation (including clock or outside temperature gauge).
During World War II, Cushman made the Model 39, a three-wheeled utility scooter with a large storage bin between the front wheels.
They sold 606 to the US military during the war.
The Piaggio MP3 and Yamaha Tricity are modern tilting three-wheeled scooters.
Unlike most motorcycle trikes, they are reverse trikes, with two front wheels which steer, and a single driven rear wheel.
The front suspension allows both front wheels to tilt independently, so that all three wheels remain in contact with the ground as it leans when cornering.
The trend toward maxi-scooters began in 1986 when Honda introduced the CN250 Helix / Fusion / Spazio.
Many years later, Suzuki launched the Burgman 400 and 650 models.
Honda (600 cc or 37 cu in), Aprilia/Gilera (839 cc or 51.2 cu in), Yamaha (530 cc or 32 cu in), Kymco (700 cc or 43 cu in) and others have also introduced scooters with engine displacements ranging from 400 to 850 cc (24 to 52 cu in).
Honda's PS250 (also known as Big Ruckus) features a motorcycle-like exoskeleton instead of bodywork.
A new direction in maxi-scooters has the engine fixed to the frame.
This arrangement improves handling by allowing bigger wheels and less unsprung weight, also tending to move the centre of gravity forwards.
The trend toward larger, more powerful scooters with fully automatic transmissions converges with an emerging trend in motorcycle design that foreshadows automatic transmission motorcycles with on-board storage.
Examples include the Aprilia Mana 850 automatic-transmission motorcycle and the Honda NC700D Integra, which is a scooter built on a motorcycle platform.
Some scooters, including the BMW C1 and the Honda Gyro Canopy, have a windscreen and a roof.
The Piaggio MP3 offered a tall windscreen with roof as an option.
With increasingly strict environmental laws, including United States emission standards and European emission standards, more scooters are using four-stroke engines again.
Scooters may be powered by an electric motor powered by a rechargeable battery.
Petroleum hybrid-electric scooters are available.
Electric scooters are rising in popularity because of higher gasoline prices, and battery technology is gradually improving, making this form of transportation more practical—the battery size is constrained by what the frame will fit, limiting range.
An underbone is a motorcycle built on a chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube.
An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the head stock to the structure under the front of the seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the rider's knees.
Underbones are commonly referred to as "step-throughs" and appeal to both genders in much the same way as scooters.
Underbones are often mistaken for scooters and are sometimes marketed as such.
However, an underbone does not have a footboard, and is therefore not a scooter.
The engine of an underbone is usually fixed to the chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its swingarm.
As a result, underbone engines are usually further forwards than those of scooters.
A typical underbone therefore has a more central centre of gravity than a typical scooter.
Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives a typical scooter more unsprung mass than a typical underbone.
These factors give a typical underbone better handling than a typical scooter.
The engine of an underbone typically drives the rear wheel by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle.
This final drive is often concealed by a chain enclosure to keep the chain clean and reduce wear.
The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a sealed oil bath and is shorter.
An underbone is usually fitted with near full-size motorcycle wheels, which are often spoked.
Scooter wheels are usually small, and made from pressed steel.
In both cases, more recent examples often have cast alloy wheels.
The bigger wheels of an underbone allow more ventilation and better cooling for the brakes than the smaller wheels of a scooter.
While the engine and suspension layouts described here for scooters and underbones are typical, they are not rigid definitions.
There have been scooters with fixed engines and chain drive, and there have been underbones with swingarm-mounted engines.
A twenty-first century example of variance from the typical scooter layout is the Suzuki Choinori, which had both its engine and its rear axle rigidly bolted to its frame.
Motor scooters are very popular in Asia, particularly in countries such as India, Indonesia, The Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Japan and Taiwan where there is local manufacturing.
They are also popular in the West, mainly in Europe (particularly Italy and the Mediterranean), but not in the US.
Parking, storage, and traffic issues in crowded cities, along with the easy driving position make them a popular form of urban transportation.
In many nations, scooter (and other small motorcycle) sales exceed those of automobiles, and a motor scooter is often the family transport.
In Taiwan, road infrastructure has been built specifically with two wheelers in mind, with separate lanes and intersection turn boxes.
In Thailand, scooters are used for street to door taxi services, as well as for navigating through heavy traffic.
The extensive range of cycle tracks in the Netherlands extends into parts of Belgium and Germany and is open to all small powered two-wheelers.
Motor scooters are popular because of their size, fuel-efficiency, weight, and typically larger storage room than a motorcycle.
In many localities, certain road motor scooters are considered by law to be in the same class as mopeds or small motorcycles and therefore they have fewer restrictions than do larger motorcycles.
According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, sales of motor scooters in the United States have more than doubled since 2000.
The motorcycle industry as a whole has seen 13 years of consecutive growth.
According to council figures, 42,000 scooters were sold in 2000.
By 2004, that number increased to 97,000.
Scooter sales in 2008 in the United States were up 41% on 2007, and represented 9% of all powered two-wheeler sales.
However, there was a decrease in US scooter sales in 2009 of 59% against2008, compared with a 41% fall for all powered two-wheelers, while the scooter's contribution to total US powered two-wheeler sales in 2009 fell to 6%.
After a two-year slump, scooter sales in the US rebounded in the first quarter of 2011.
In the 1960s mod subculture, some members of this British youth cult used motorscooters for transportation, usually Vespas or Lambrettas.
Scooters had provided inexpensive transportation for decades before the development of the mod subculture, but the mods stood out in the way that they treated the vehicle as a fashion accessory, expressed through clubs such as the Ace of Herts.
Italian scooters were preferred for their cleanlined, curving shapes and gleaming chrome.
For young mods, Italian scooters were the "embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing".
They customized their scooters by painting them in "two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [them] with luggage racks, crash bars, and scores of mirrors and fog lights", and they often put their names on the small windscreen.
Engine side panels and front bumpers were taken to local electroplating workshops and plated with highly reflective chrome.
Scooters were also a practical and accessible form of transportation for 1960s teens.
In the early 1960s, public transport stopped relatively early in the night, and so having scooters allowed mods to stay out all night at dance clubs.
To keep their expensive suits clean and keep warm while riding, mods often wore long army parkas.
For teens with low-end jobs, scooters were cheaper than cars, and they could be bought on a payment plan through newly available hire purchase plans.
After a law was passed requiring at least one mirror be attached to every motorcycle, mods were known to add four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters.
The cover of The Who's album Quadrophenia, which includes themes related to mods and rockers, depicts a young man on a Vespa GS with four mirrors attached.
The album spawned a 1979 motion picture of the same name.
and the American quarterly magazine Scoot!.
A side-view mirror (or side mirror), also known as a door mirror and often (in the UK) called a wing mirror, is a mirror placed on the exterior of motor vehicles for the purposes of helping the driver see areas behind and to the sides of the vehicle, outside the driver's peripheral vision (in the "blind spot").
Almost all modern cars mount their side mirrors on the doors—normally at the A-pillar—rather than the wings (the portion of the body above the wheel well).
The side mirror is equipped for manual or remote vertical and horizontal adjustment so as to provide adequate coverage to drivers of differing height and seated position.
Remote adjustment may be mechanical by means of bowden cables, or may be electric by means of geared motors.
The mirror glass may also be electrically heated and may include electrochromic dimming to reduce glare to the driver from the headlamps of following vehicles.
Increasingly, the side mirror incorporates the vehicle's turn signal repeaters.
There is evidence to suggest that mirror-mounted repeaters may be more effective than repeaters mounted in the previously predominant fender side location.
Through the 1940s, most roads had just two lanes, one in each direction.
Drivers usually had to be aware only of traffic ahead of and directly behind them.
Due to this, early cars had just a single rear-view mirror mounted on the top of the windshield or on top of the dashboard.
When side mirrors were introduced to help drivers see overtaking vehicles, most cars only had the driver side mirror as standard equipment.
A passenger side mirror was optional on most cars through the 1970s.
Today all 3 mirrors are standard on almost all passenger vehicles.
In the U.S. and Canada, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 and the Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 require the driver-side mirror to provide "unit magnification", i.e., an undistorted 1:1 reflection achieved with a flat mirror.
However, unit magnification limits the field of view that can be provided by a mirror of size compatible with the vehicle body.
The ECE regulations in use throughout most of the world except North America permit the driver-side mirror to have a planar, convex, or aspheric surface; an aspheric section is often combined with a larger convex section, and the two sections are separated by a visible line to alert the driver to the two sections' different perspective shifts.
Because of the distance from the driver's eye to the passenger side mirror, a useful field of view can be achieved only with a convex or aspheric mirror.
However, the convexity also minifies the objects shown.
Since such objects seem farther away than they actually are, a driver might make a maneuver such as a lane change assuming an adjacent vehicle is a safe distance behind, when in fact it is quite a bit closer.
In the United States, Canada, India, Korea and Australia, non-planar mirrors are etched or printed with the warning legend objects in the mirror are closer than they appear.
In Canada, this warning is often supplemented by a transparent decal on the passenger side window repeating the warning in French: les objets dans le retroviseur sont plus proche qu'ils ne le paraissent.
In Korea, the warning appears in Korean.
Warnings of this nature are not required in Europe.
ECE Regulation 46 requires that side mirrors be mounted such that they swing away when struck by a test cylinder meant to represent a pedestrian.
Until March 1983, the Japanese Ministry of Transport did not allow cars to be registered without mirrors on front fenders, so the mirrors were mounted far forward atop the front fenders.
More recent Japanese-specification vehicles have side mirrors similar to those in other countries.
Taxi drivers and other professional drivers retain a preference for the wing-mounted mirrors as they feel that they work better in extremely tight traffic.
U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 requires that convex side-view mirrors must have a curvature radius of between 889 mm and 1651 mm.
Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 stipulates a range of between 890 mm and 1800 mm.
Neither the U.S. nor the Canadian standard allows for aspheric mirrors.
The European ECE Regulation 46 used throughout most of the world permits planar, convex, and/or aspheric mirrors on either side of the vehicle.
American research suggests non-planar driver side mirrors may help reduce crashes.
In 2018, side mirrors in a form of camera and display were introduced for a better peripheral recognition upon driving.
It has advantages over conventional ones as it may provide wider angle of sight and less air resistance without obstructing driver's frontal view, though the first of these problems can be alleviated in regular mirrors by adjusting them such that the view presented offers only minimal overlap with that of the interior mirror.
Problems with digital mirrors include difficulties relating to the inherent lack of binocular vision (such as impaired depth perception, and the requirement for the viewer to readjust focus to the distance of the mirror surface instead of merely the distance to the object), as well as from problems related to both the reduced dynamic range and the sensitivity of a camera in low light conditions.
This type of mirror also needs power to function.
These side mirrors are installed on various types of vehicles such as Hyundai Ioniq 5, Audi e-tron.
Mercedes-Benz introduced such a system 2018 in the Actros under the name "MirrorCam".
A semi-automatic transmission is a multiple-speed transmission where part of its operation is automated (typically the actuation of the clutch), but the driver's input is still required to launch the vehicle from a standstill and to manually change gears.
Semi-automatic transmissions were almost exclusively used in motorcycles and are based on conventional manual transmissions or sequential manual transmissions, but use an automatic clutch system.
But some semi-automatic transmissions have also been based on standard hydraulic automatic transmissions with torque converters and planetary gearsets.
Names for specific types of semi-automatic transmissions include clutchless manual, auto-manual, auto-clutch manual, and paddle-shift transmissions.
These systems facilitate gear shifts for the driver by operating the clutch system automatically, usually via switches that trigger an actuator or servo, while still requiring the driver to manually shift gears.
This contrasts with a preselector gearbox, in which the driver operates the clutch and selects the next gear ratio, but the gear change within the transmission is performed automatically.
The first usage of semi-automatic transmissions was in automobiles, increasing in popularity in the mid-1930s when they were offered by several American car manufacturers.
Less common than traditional hydraulic automatic transmissions, semi-automatic transmissions have nonetheless been made available on various car and motorcycle models and have remained in production throughout the 21st century.
Semi-automatic transmissions with paddle shift operation have been used in various racing cars, and were first introduced to control the electro-hydraulic gear shift mechanism of the Ferrari 640 Formula One car in 1989.
These systems are currently used on a variety of top-tier racing car classes; including Formula One, IndyCar, and touring car racing.
Other applications include motorcycles, trucks, buses, and railway vehicles.
Semi-automatics facilitate easier gear shifts by removing the need to depress a clutch pedal or lever at the same time as changing gears.
Most cars that have a semi-automatic transmission are not fitted with a standard clutch pedal since the clutch is remotely controlled.
Similarly, most motorcycles with a semi-automatic transmission are not fitted with a conventional clutch lever on the handlebar.
Most semi-automatic transmissions are based on conventional manual transmission.
They can be partially automated transmission.
Once the clutch becomes automated, the transmission becomes semi-automatic.
However, these systems still require manual gear selection by the driver.
This type of transmission is called a clutchless manual or an automated manual.
Most semi-automatic transmissions in older passenger cars retain the normal H-pattern shifter of a manual transmission; similarly, semi-automatic transmissions on older motorcycles retain the conventional foot-shift lever, as on a motorcycle with a fully manual transmission.
However, semi-automatics systems in newer motorcycles, racing cars, and other types of vehicles often use gear selection methods such as shift paddles near the steering wheel or triggers near the handlebars.
Several different forms of automation for clutch actuation have been used over the years, from hydraulic, pneumatic, and electromechanical clutches to vacuum-operated, electromagnetic, and even centrifugal clutches.
Fluid couplings (most commonly and formerly used in early automatic transmissions) have also been used by various manufacturers, usually alongside some form of mechanical friction clutch, to prevent the vehicle from stalling when coming to a standstill or at idle.
A typical semi-automatic transmission design may work by using Hall effect sensors or micro switches to detect the direction of the requested shift when the gear stick is used.
These sensors' output, combined with the output from a sensor connected to the gearbox which measures its current speed and gear, is fed into a transmission control unit, electronic control unit, engine control unit, or microprocessor, or another type of electronic control system.
This control system then determines the optimal timing and torque required for smooth clutch engagement.
The electronic control unit powers an actuator, which engages and disengages the clutch in a smooth manner.
In some cases, the clutch is actuated by a servomotor coupled to a gear arrangement for a linear actuator, which, via a hydraulic cylinder filled with hydraulic fluid from the braking system, disengages the clutch.
In other cases, the internal clutch actuator may be completely electric, where the main clutch actuator is powered by an electric motor or solenoid, or even pneumatic, where the main clutch actuator is a pneumatic actuator that disengages the clutch.
A clutchless manual system, named the Autostick, was a semi-automatic transmission introduced by Volkswagen for the 1968 model year.
Marketed as the Volkswagen Automatic Stickshift, a conventional three-speed manual transmission was connected to a vacuum-operated automatic clutch system.
The top of the gear stick was designed to  depress and activate an electric switch, i.e. when touched by the driver's hand.
When pressed, the switch operated a 12-volt solenoid, which in turn operated the vacuum clutch actuator, thus disengaging the clutch and allowing shifting between gears.
With the driver's hand removed from the gearshift, the clutch would re-engage automatically.
The transmission was also equipped with a torque converter, allowing the car to idle in gear like with an automatic, as well as stop and start from a standstill in any gear.
Starting in the late 1990s, automotive manufacturers introduced what is now called an automated manual transmission (AMT), which is mechanically similar to, and has its roots in, earlier clutchless manual transmission systems.
An AMT functions in the same way as older semi-automatic and clutchless manual transmissions, but with two exceptions; it is able to both operate the clutch and shift automatically, and does not use a torque converter.
Shifting is done either automatically from a transmission control unit (TCU), or manually from either the shift knob or shift paddles mounted behind the steering wheel.
AMTs combine the fuel efficiency of manual transmissions with the shifting ease of automatic transmissions.
Their biggest disadvantage is poor shifting comfort due to the mechanical clutch being disengaged by the TCU, which is easily noticeable as "jolting".
Some transmission makers have tried solving this issue by using oversized synchronizer rings and not fully opening the clutch during shifting—which works in theory, but as of 2007, there have not been any series production cars with such functions.
In passenger cars, modern AMTs generally have six speeds (though some have seven) and a rather long gearing.
In combination with a smart-shifting program, this can significantly reduce fuel consumption.
In general, there are two types of AMTs: integrated AMTs and add-on AMTs.
Integrated AMTs were designed to be dedicated AMTs, whereas add-on AMTs are conversions of standard manual transmissions into AMTs.
An automated manual transmission may include a fully automatic mode where the driver does not need to change gears at all.
These transmissions can be described as a standard manual transmission with an automated clutch and automated gear shift control, allowing them to operate in the same manner as traditional automatic transmissions.
The TCU automatically shifts gears if, for example, the engine is redlined.
The AMT can be switched to a clutchless manual mode wherein one can upshift or downshift using a console-mounted shift selector or paddle shifters.
It has a lower cost than conventional automatic transmissions.
The automated manual transmission (trade names include SMG-III) is not to be confused with "manumatic" automatic transmission (marketed under trade names such as Tiptronic, Steptronic, Sportmatic, and Geartronic).
While these systems seem superficially similar, a manumatic uses a torque converter like an automatic transmission, instead of the clutch used in the automated manual transmission.
An automated manual can give the driver full control of the gear selection, whereas a manumatic will deny a gear change request that would result in the engine stalling (from too few RPM) or over-revving.
The automatic mode of an automated manual transmission at low or frequent stop start speeds is less smooth than that of manumatics and other automatic transmissions.
Several semi-automatic transmissions used by motorcycles and racing cars are actually mechanically based on sequential manual transmissions.
Semi-automatic motorcycle transmissions generally omit the clutch lever, but retain the conventional heel-and-toe foot shift lever.
Semi-automatic motorcycle transmissions are based on conventional sequential manual transmissions and typically use a centrifugal clutch.
At idle speed, the engine is disconnected from the gearbox input shaft, allowing both it and the bike to freewheel, unlike with torque converter automatics, there is no idle creep with a properly adjusted centrifugal clutch.
As the engine speed rises, counterweights within the clutch assembly gradually pivot further outwards until they start to make contact with the inside of the outer housing and transmit an increasing amount of engine power and torque.
The effective "bite point" or "biting point" is found automatically by equilibrium, where the power is transmitted through the (still-slipping) clutch is equal to what the engine can provide.
This allows relatively fast full-throttle takeoffs (with the clutch adjusted so the engine is at peak torque) without the engine slowing or being bogged down, as well as more relaxed starts and low-speed maneuvers at lower throttle and RPMs.
In 1901, Amédée Bollée developed a method of shifting gears that did not require the use of a clutch and was activated by a ring mounted within the steering wheel.
One car using this system was the 1912 Bollée Type F Torpedo.
Prior to the arrival of the first mass-produced hydraulic automatic transmission (the General Motors Hydra-Matic) in 1940, several American manufacturers offered various devices to reduce the amount of clutch or shifting input required.
These devices were intended to reduce the difficulty of operating the unsynchronised manual transmissions, or "crash gearboxes", that were commonly used, especially in stop-start driving.
An early step towards automated transmissions was the 1933–1935 REO Self-Shifter, which automatically shifted between two forward gears in the "forward" mode (or between two shorter gear ratios in the "emergency low" mode).
Standing starts required the driver to use the clutch pedal.
The Self-Shifter first appeared in May 1933 and was offered as standard on the Royale and as an option on the Flying Cloud S-4.
In 1937, the four-speed Oldsmobile Automatic Safety Transmission was introduced on the Oldsmobile Six and Oldsmobile Eight models.
It used a planetary gearset with a clutch pedal for starting from a standstill and switching between the "low" and "high" ranges.
The Automatic Safety Transmission was replaced by the fully-automatic Hydra-Matic for the 1940 model year.
The 1938–1939 Buick Special was available with another Self-Shifter 4-speed semi-automatic transmission, which used a manual clutch for starting from standstill and an automated clutch for gear changes.
The 1941 Chrysler M4 Vacamatic transmission was a two-speed manual transmission with an integral underdrive unit, a traditional manual clutch, and a fluid coupling between the engine and the clutch.
The two-speed transmission had "high" and "low" ranges, and the clutch was used when the driver wanted to switch between ranges.
For normal driving, the driver would press the clutch, select the High range, and then release the clutch.
Once the accelerator was pressed, the fluid coupling would engage and the car would begin moving forward, with the underdrive unit engaged to provide a lower gear ratio.
At between 15–20 mph (24–32 km/h), the driver would lift off the accelerator and the underdrive unit would disengage.
The Vacamatic was replaced by a similar M6 Presto-Matic transmission for the 1946 model year.
Similar designs were used for the 1941–1950 Hudson Drive-Master and the ill-fated 1942 Lincoln Liquimatic.
Both of these combined a 3-speed manual transmission with automated shifting between the 2nd and 3rd gears, instead of the Vacamatic's "underdrive" unit.
The Packard Electro-Matic, introduced in the 1941 Packard Clipper and Packard 180, was an early clutchless manual transmission that used a traditional friction clutch with automatic vacuum operation, which was controlled by the position of the accelerator.
The Automotive Products manumatic system, available on the 1953 Ford Anglia 100E, was a vacuum-powered automatic clutch system that was actuated by a switch that was triggered whenever the gear stick was moved.
The system could control the throttle cable (to keep the engine at the required RPM for the gear change) and vary the rate of clutch engagement.
The successive Newtondrive system, available on the 1957–1958 Ford Anglia, also had a provision for choke control.
A similar product was the German Saxomat automatic clutch system, which was introduced in the mid-1950s and available on various European cars.
The Citroën DS, introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system with a hydraulically-operated speed controller and idle speed step-up device to select gears and operate the otherwise conventional clutch.
This allowed clutchless shifting with a single column-mounted selector, while the driver simultaneously lifted off the accelerator to change gear.
This system was nicknamed "Citro-Matic" in the U.S.
For the 1962 model year, American Motors introduced the E-Stick, which eliminated the clutch pedal in the Rambler American with standard three-speed manual transmissions.
This automatic clutch used engine oil pressure as a hydraulic source and was available for less than $60.
Compared to fully automatic transmissions of the time, the E-Stick offered the fuel economy of a stick-shift, with vacuum and electric switches controlling the clutch.
The E-Stick three-speed transmission was offered on the larger Rambler Classic models, along with an overdrive unit.
The system was only available with 6-cylinder engines, and the lack of a clutch proved unpopular, so it was discontinued after 1964.
The 1967 Volkswagen WSK (Wandlerschaltkupplungsgetriebe; English: Torque converter shift/clutch gearbox), used in the Beetle, Type 3 and Karmann Ghia, was one of the first gearboxes of its kind, with an automatic mechanical clutch and a torque converter.
It was also known as the Autostick.
Shifting was done manually by the driver.
The automatic mechanical clutch allowed the car to accelerate from a stop, whereas the torque converter enabled it to do so in any gear.
Dampening engine vibrations and providing torque multiplication, it functioned as a sort of "reduction gearbox", so the actual mechanical gearbox only needed three forward gears (this is why conventional automatic transmissions with torque converters normally have fewer gears than manual transmissions).
The WSK had no "first" gear; instead, the first gear was converted into reverse gear, and the second gear was labeled first (with the third and fourth gears respectively being labeled second and third).
The Chevrolet Torque-Drive transmission, introduced on the 1968 Chevrolet Nova and Camaro, is one of a few examples where a semi-automatic transmission was based on a conventional hydraulic automatic transmission (rather than a standard manual transmission).
The Torque-Drive was essentially a 2-speed Powerglide automatic transmission without the vacuum modulator, requiring the driver to manually shift gears between "Low" and "High".
The quadrant indicator on Torque-Drive cars was "Park-R-N-Hi-1st".
The driver would start the car in "1st," then move the lever to "Hi" when desired.
The Torque-Drive was discontinued at the end of 1971 and replaced by a traditional hydraulic automatic transmission.
Other examples of semi-automatic transmissions based on hydraulic automatics were the Ford 3-speed Semi-Automatic Transmission used in the 1970–1971 Ford Maverick, early versions of Honda's 1972–1988 Hondamatic 2-speed and 3-speed transmissions, and the Daihatsu Diamatic 2-speed transmission used in the 1985–1991 Daihatsu Charade.
An early example of a semi-automatic motorcycle transmission was the use of an automatic centrifugal clutch in the early 1960s by the Czechoslovakian manufacturer Jawa Moto.
Their design was used without permission in the 1965 Honda Cub 50, which resulted in Jawa suing Honda for patent infringement and Honda agreeing to pay royalties for each motorcycle using the design.
Honda's Hondamatic two-speed transmission fitted with a torque converter (which shares its name with several fully-automatic transmissions), as used in its 1976 CB750A, 1977 CB400A Hawk, 1978 CM400A and 1982 CM450A. Those in various minibikes, including the Amstar Nostalgia 49, Honda CRF50F, Z series, and ST series, Kawasaki KLX-110, KLX-110R, and KSR110, KTM 65 SX, Suzuki DR-Z50, DR-Z70, and DR-Z125, SSR SR110TR, and Yamaha TT-R50E. Yamaha used an automatic clutch system called YCCS on motorcycles such as the 2006 Yamaha FJR1300AE sports-touring.
This system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the clutch lever would go on traditional motorcycles.
The Can-Am Spyder Roadster's SE5 and SE6 5-speed and 6-speed transmissions.
Those in several underbone motorcycles in the 1970s; the Suzuki FR50, Suzuki FR80, and Yamaha Townmate used 3-speed transmissions with a heel-and-toe gear shift.
Some high-performance sport bikes use a trigger-shift system, with a handlebar-mounted trigger, paddle, switch, or button, and an automatically operated clutch.
Some dirt bikes use this system, which is sometimes referred to as an auto-clutch transmission.
These include the Honda CRF110F and Yamaha TT-R110E.
The conventional motorcycle foot shifter is retained, but the manual hand-clutch lever is no longer required.
Semi-automatic transmissions in dirt bikes may be referred to as "automatic" despite a lack of automatic shifting.
Semi-automatic transmissions in racing cars are typically operated by shift paddles connected to a designated transmission control unit.
The first Formula One car to use a semi-automatic transmission was the 1989 Ferrari 640.
It used hydraulic actuators and electrical solenoids for clutch control and shifting, and was shifted via two paddles mounted behind the steering wheel.
Another paddle on the steering wheel controlled the clutch, which was only needed when starting from a standstill.
The car won its debut race at the Brazilian Grand Prix, but for much of the season suffered from reliability problems.
Other teams began switching to similar semi-automatic transmissions; the 1991 Williams FW14 was the first to use a sequential drum-rotation mechanism (similar to those used in motorcycle transmissions), which allowed for a more compact design that required only one actuator to rotate the drum and change gears.
A further development was made possible by the introduction of electronic throttle control soon after, which made it possible for the car to automatically rev-match during downshifts.
By 1993, most teams were using semi-automatic transmissions.
The last F1 car fitted with a conventional manual gearbox, the Forti FG01, raced in 1995.
Following concerns about the potential for Formula One cars to shift gears automatically without any driver input, mandatory software was introduced in 1994 that ensured that gear changes only occurred when instructed by the driver.
Pre-programmed, computer-controlled, fully-automatic upshifts and downshifts were re-introduced and allowed from 2001, and were permitted from that year's Spanish Grand Prix, but were banned again in 2004.
Buttons on the steering wheel to shift directly to a particular gear (instead of having to shift sequentially using the paddles) are permitted.
The 2005 Minardi PS05, Renault R25, and Williams FW27 were the last Formula 1 cars to use a 6-speed gearbox before the switch to a mandatory 7-speed gearbox for the 2006 season.
Since 2014 season, Formula 1 cars currently use mandatory 8-speed paddle-shift gearboxes.
The now-defunct CART Champ Car Series switched from a lever-shift sequential system to a 7-speed paddle-shift system for the 2007 season.
This transmission was introduced with the new-for-2007 Panoz DP01 chassis.
The rival IndyCar Series introduced their 6-speed semi-automatic paddle-shift system for the 2008 season, also replacing the previous lever-shifted sequential transmission, introduced with the Dallara IR-05 chassis for 2008.
IndyCars currently use the Xtrac P1011 sequential transmission, which uses a semi-automatic paddle shift system supplied by Mega-Line called AGS (Assisted Gearshift System).
AGS uses a pneumatic gearshift and clutch actuator controlled by an internal transmission control unit.
Both the FIA Formula 2 and Formula 3 Championships currently use 6-speed sequential gearboxes with electro-hydraulic operation via shift paddles.
Manual control of the multi-plate clutch systems via a lever behind the steering wheel is used to launch the cars.
DTM currently uses a Hewland DTT-200 6-speed sequential transmission with steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles, which was introduced for the 2012 season with the new rule change.
This new system replaced the older lever-shifted sequential transmission, which had been used for the previous 12 seasons (since 2000).
During the 1940s to 1960s, many small diesel shunting locomotives used epicyclic semi-automatic transmissions.
For example, the British Rail Class 03 and British Rail Class 04 used the Wilson-Drewry CA5 R7 transmission.
The Sinclair S.S.S. Powerflow, used from the 1950s to the early 1960s in Huwood-Hudswell diesel mining locomotives, the British Rail Class D2/7 and the British Rail Class D2/12.
The Powerflow design is of the layshaft type with constant-mesh gears and dog clutch engagement, allowing it to provide seamless power delivery during upshifts.
This transmission was also used in some road vehicles.
The Self-Changing Gears Pneumocyclic, an epicyclic transmission built in the United Kingdom from the 1960s to the 1980s.
Using a similar design to the company's previous preselector gearboxes, the Pneumocyclic transmission was used in several buses, such as the Leyland Leopard, Panther, and Tiger.
It was also fitted to several thousand British diesel railcars during this time.
All-terrain vehicles, such as the Honda ATC185, Honda ATC200, Honda TRX90X and TRX250X (Honda SportClutch), Suzuki LT125D Quadrunner (also known as the Suzuki QuadRunner 125), Suzuki LT 230, Suzuki Eiger 400, Yamaha Big Bear 250, 350, and 400, Yamaha Grizzly 80, Yamaha Grizzly 700, Yamaha Raptor 80, Yamaha YFB250 Timberwolf, the Yamaha Moto-4 ATV range, and the Yamaha Tri-Moto range.
The Honda Electric Shift Program is used in ATVs such as the 1998 Honda TRX450FE (also called the Foreman 450ES ESP) and first-generation Honda Rincon.
Shifting is accomplished by pressing one of the two gear selector arrows on the left handlebar, which activates an electric shifting system.
A single-cylinder engine, sometimes called a thumper, is a piston engine with one cylinder.
This engine is often used for motorcycles, motor scooters, motorized bicycles, go-karts, all-terrain vehicles, radio-controlled vehicles, power tools and garden machinery (such as chainsaws, lawn mowers, cultivators, and string trimmers).
Single-cylinder engines are made both as 4-strokes and 2-strokes.
Compared with multi-cylinder engines, single-cylinder engines are usually simpler and compact.
Due to the greater potential for airflow around all sides of the cylinder, air cooling is often more effective for single cylinder engines than multi-cylinder engines.
This reduces the weight and complexity of air-cooled single-cylinder engines, compared with liquid-cooled engines.
Drawbacks of single-cylinder engines include a more pulsating power delivery through each cycle and higher levels of vibration.
The uneven power delivery means that often a single-cylinder engine requires a heavier flywheel than a comparable multi-cylinder engine, resulting in relatively slower changes in engine speed.
To reduce the vibration level, they often make greater use of balance shafts than multi-cylinder engines, as well as more extreme methods such as a dummy connecting rod (for example the Ducati Supermono).
These balancing devices can reduce the benefits of single-cylinder engines regarding lower weight and complexity.
Most single-cylinder engines used in motor vehicles are fueled by petrol (and use a four-stroke cycle), however diesel single-cylinder engines are also used in stationary applications (such as the Lombardini 3LD and 15LD).
A variation known as the split-single makes use of two pistons which share a single combustion chamber.
Early motorcycles, automobiles and other applications such as marine engines all tended to be single-cylinder.
The configuration is almost exclusively used in portable tools, along with garden machinery such as lawn mowers.
Single cylinder engines also remain in widespread use in motorcycles, motor scooters, go-karts, auto rickshaws, and radio-controlled models.
From 1921 to 1960, the Lanz Bulldog tractor used a large horizontally-mounted single cylinder two-stroke engine.
However they are rarely used in modern automobiles and tractors, due to developments in engine technology.
Single cylinder engines remain the most common engine layout in motor scooters and low-powered motorcycles.
The Honda Super Cub (the motor vehicle with the highest overall sales since its introduction in 1958) uses a 49 cc (3.0 cu in) four-stroke single-cylinder engine.
There are also several single-cylinder sportbikes (such as the KTM 690 Duke R), dual-sport motorcycles (such as the BMW G650GS) and the classic-styled Royal Enfield 500 Bullet.
The Moto3 class in the MotoGP World Championship have used four-stroke 250 cc (15.3 cu in) single cylinder engines since the class replaced 125 cc (7.6 cu in) two-strokes in 2012.
Engines of other sorts, like the beam engine and certain types of Stirling engine, operate using one cylinder and thus can also be considered single-cylinder engines.
Siegfried Samuel Marcus (German: [ˈziːkfʁiːt ˈmaʁkʊs]; 18 September 1831 – 1 July 1898) was a German inventor.
Marcus was born in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
He made the first petrol-powered vehicle in 1864, while living in Vienna, Austria.
Marcus was born in Malchin, in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin into a Jewish family.
Today Malchin is part of Germany.
He began work at age 12 as an apprentice mechanic.
At 17 he joined Siemens and Halske, an engineering company that built telegraph lines.
He moved to Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire, in 1852, working first as a technician in the Physical Institute of the Medical School.
He then worked as an assistant to Professor Carl Ludwig, a physiologist.
In 1860 Marcus opened his own workshop which made mechanical and electrical equipment.
The first was located at Mariahilferstrasse 107 and the second at Mondscheingasse 4.
His chief improvements include telegraph relay system and ignition devices such as the "Wiener Zünder", a blasting machine.
Marcus was buried at the Protestant Cemetery at Hütteldorf, Vienna.
Later, his remains were transferred to an "Honorary Tomb" of Vienna's Central Cemetery.
During his lifetime he was awarded the Golden Cross of Merit by the then Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph for his scientific achievements.
Because of Marcus' Jewish ancestry, his name and all memorabilia, particularly in Austria, vanished under the Nazis.
In 1937 the Austrian Harand Movement Against Racial Hatred had issued a series of stamps featuring prominent Jews, including Marcus, who had contributed to mankind in response to the Ewiger Jude (eternal Jew) exhibition by Julius Streicher in Munich.
Marcus was credited as having invented the petrol driven motor car.
With the German occupation of Austria in March 1938, the memorial in front of the Vienna Technical University was removed.
After World War II, the monument was rebuilt and his car, which had been hidden, was returned to display.
Auf Ihr Schreiben vom 30.
Mai 1940 Dr.Wo/Fa.
Das Bibliographische Institut und der Verlag F.A. Brockhaus sind darauf hingewiesen worden, dass in Meyers Konversations Lexikon und im Großen Brockhaus künftig nicht Siegfried Marcus, sondern die beiden deutschen Ingenieure Gottlieb Daimler und Carl Benz als Schöpfer des modernen Kraftwagens zu bezeichnen sind.
Referring to your letter of 30 May 1940 Dr.Wo / Fa.
The Bibliographical Institute and the publisher F. A. Brockhaus have been notified that in the future, [the encyclopedias]
Meyers Konversations Lexikon and the Große Brockhaus are to refer to the two German engineers Gottlieb Daimler and Carl Benz as the creators of the modern automobile, not to Siegfried Marcus.
In an article titled, "The End of the Marcus Legend", evidence is presented that the "1875” automobile was actually built much later, in 1888.
The originator of the 1875 date, Lugwig Czischek-Christen, was asked by patent lawyers to produce any evidence to support the 1875 date, and during the course of his investigation, he uncovered "decisive" evidence that the automobile was actually built in 1888, and not in 1875 as he had originally published for the 1898 Austrian exhibits at the Paris exposition.
Based on the information from existing sources, Marcus' first machine was built on a simple handcart in 1870.
but had to be started by lifting the drive wheels off the ground and spinning them.
The internal combustion engine was designed for liquid combustibles and made him the first to propel a vehicle by means of petrol.
Marcus was not satisfied with this cart and dismantled it.
However, his first automobile model was displayed at the Vienna Exhibition in 1864 (more likely the 1873 Vienna Internation Exhibition according to earliest sources) and his second model was made and driven in 1875.
In 1883 a patent for a low-voltage ignition magneto was given to Marcus in Germany and a new petrol engine built.
This design was used for all further engines, including that of the only existing Marcus car from 1888 to 1889.
It was this ignition, in conjunction with the "rotating brush carburettor", that made the engine's design very innovative.
By 1886 the German navy was using the engine in its torpedo boats.
In 1887, Marcus started a co-operation with the Moravian company Märky, Bromovsky & Schulz.
They offered two stroke and — after the fall of the Otto-Patent in 1886 — four stroke engines of the Marcus type.
In 1875 Märky, Bromovsky & Schulz built the car which can still be seen in Vienna's Technical Museum.
This car made Marcus well-known all over the world.
The car was named a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
In a 1904 book, "The Motor," it states: Who was the Inventor?
Siegfried Marcus is widely credited with having invented the benzine motor.
John Nixon of the London Times in 1938 considered Marcus' development of the motor car to have been experimental, as opposed to Benz who took the concept from experimental to production.
Nixon described Marcus' cars as impractical.
12 years later, in 1950, the Times described the car at the Vienna Technical Museum as being built in 1875 and the first petrol-powered road vehicle.
A description of its first journey of 7.5 miles from Vienna to Klosterneuberg was included in the article.
Since the car was moved to the Museum in 1918, it has only twice been driven, once when sent for display in Sweden.
Marcus was the holder of 131 patents in 16 countries.
He never applied for a patent for the motorcar and, of course, he never held one.
Nevertheless, he was the first to use petrol to propel a vehicle, in the simple handcart of 1864, but it is uncertain whether the extant Marcus car ran before 1890.
In conjunction with Captain E von Wohlgemuth of the Imperial German Navy, Marcus invented an electrical ignition of ships cannons.
The advantages of the system were that it allowed for the simultaneous firing of the cannons, or selection of a particular firing pattern, and the ability to fire them from the ship's bridge.

A seat belt, also known as a safety belt or spelled seatbelt, is a vehicle safety device designed to secure the driver or a passenger of a vehicle against harmful movement that may result during a collision or a sudden stop.
A seat belt reduces the likelihood of death or serious injury in a traffic collision by reducing the force of secondary impacts with interior strike hazards, by keeping occupants positioned correctly for maximum effectiveness of the airbag (if equipped), and by preventing occupants being ejected from the vehicle in a crash or if the vehicle rolls over.
When in motion, the driver and passengers are traveling at the same speed as the vehicle.
If the vehicle suddenly stops or crashes, the occupants continue at the same speed the vehicle was going before it stopped.
A  seat belt applies an opposing force to the driver and passengers to prevent them from falling out or making contact with the interior of the car (especially preventing contact with, or going through, the windshield).
Seat belts are considered primary restraint systems (PRSs), because of their vital role in occupant safety.
An analysis conducted in the United States in 1984 compared a variety of seat belt types alone and in combination with air bags.
The range of fatality reduction for front seat passengers was broad, from 20% to 55%, as was the range of major injury, from 25% to 60%.
More recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has summarized these data by stating "seat belts reduce serious crash-related injuries and deaths by about half."
Most  malfunctions are a result of there being too much slack in the seat belt at the time of the accident.
It has been suggested that although seat belt usage reduces the probability of death in any given accident, mandatory seat belt laws have little or no effect on the overall number of traffic fatalities because seat belt usage also disincentivizes safe driving behaviors, thereby increasing the total number of accidents.
This idea, known as compensating-behavior theory, is not supported by the evidence.
In case of vehicle rollover in a U.S. passenger car, there are 0.71% fatalities in 1994 and 0.87% in 2014 when user is restrained.
There are 7% fatalities in 1994 and 13% in 2014 when the user is unrestrained.
In case of vehicle rollover, there are 10% incapacitating injury in 1994 and 10% in 2014 when the user is restrained.
There are 32% incapacitating injury in 1994 and 25% in 2014 when user is unrestrained.
The probability of no injury is 45% in 1994 and 44% in 2014 when the user is restrained.
There were 19% no injury in 1994 and 15% in 2014 when the user is unrestrained.
Seat belts were invented by English engineer George Cayley, to use on his glider, in the mid-19th century.
In 1946, C. Hunter Shelden opened a neurological practice at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, California.
In the early 1950s, Shelden made a major contribution to the automotive industry with his idea of retractable seat belts.
This came about from his care of the high number of head injuries coming through the emergency room.
He investigated the early seat belts with primitive designs that were implicated in these injuries and deaths.
Nash was the first American car manufacturer to offer seat belts as a factory option, in its 1949 models.
They were installed in 40,000 cars, but buyers did not want them and requested that dealers remove them.
The feature was "met with insurmountable sales resistance" and Nash reported that after one year "only 1,000 had been used" by customers.
Ford offered seat belts as an option in 1955.
These were not popular, with only 2% of Ford buyers choosing to pay for seat belts in 1956.
Glenn W. Sheren, of Mason, Michigan, submitted a patent application on March 31, 1955, for an automotive seat belt and was awarded U.S. patent 2,855,215 in 1958.
This was a continuation of an earlier patent application that Sheren had filed on September 22, 1952.
The first modern three-point seat belt (the so-called CIR-Griswold restraint) commonly used in consumer vehicles was patented in 1955 U.S. patent 2,710,649 by the Americans Roger W. Griswold and Hugh DeHaven.
Saab introduced seat belts as standard equipment in 1958.
After the Saab GT 750 was introduced at the New York Motor Show in 1958 with safety belts fitted as standard, the practice became commonplace.
Vattenfall, the Swedish national electric utility, did a study of all fatal, on-the-job accidents among their employees.
The study revealed that the majority of fatalities occurred while the employees were on the road on company business.
In response, two Vattenfall safety engineers, Bengt Odelgard and Per-Olof Weman, started to develop a seat belt.
Their work was presented to Swedish manufacturer Volvo in the late 1950s, and set the standard for seat belts in Swedish cars.
The three-point seat belt was developed to its modern form by Swedish inventor Nils Bohlin for Volvo, which introduced it in 1959 as standard equipment.
In addition to designing an effective three-point belt, Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness in a study of 28,000 accidents in Sweden.
Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants was fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph.
No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact.
Bohlin was granted U.S. patent 3,043,625 for the device.
Subsequently, in 1966, Congress passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, requiring all automobiles to comply with certain safety standards.
The first compulsory seat belt law was put in place in 1970, in the state of Victoria, Australia, requiring their use by drivers and front-seat passengers.
This legislation was enacted after trialing Hemco seat belts, designed by Desmond Hemphill (1926–2001), in the front seats of police vehicles, lowering the incidence of officer injury and death.
Mandatory seat belt laws in the United States began to be introduced in the 1980s and faced opposition, with some consumers going to court to challenge the laws.
Some cut seat belts out of their cars.
The 'belt' part of the typical seatbelt seen in vehicles worldwide is referred to as the 'webbing'.
Modern seat belt webbing has a high tensile strength, about 3000-6000lbs, to resist tearing at high loads such as during high-speed collisions or while restraining larger passengers.
While nylon was used in some early seat belts (and is still used for lap belts), it was replaced by 100% polyester due to its better UV resistance, lower extensibility and higher stiffness.
Nylon was also prone to stretching much more than polyester, and was prone to wear and tear, with tiny abrasions drastically reducing tensile strength causing a lack of reliability in one of the most important safety measures in a vehicle.
Seat belts are commonly 46 or 48 mm wide with a 2/2 herringbone twill weaving pattern to maximize the thread density.
Modern seatbelt weaves also feature snag-proof selvedges reinforced with strong polyester threads to prevent the wear and tear, while remaining flexible.
The weave features about 300 warp threads for every 46mm wide webbing, leading to around 150 ends per inch of webbing.
Accident investigators often examine the webbing of a seatbelt to determine if an occupant of a vehicle was wearing their seatbelt during a collision.
The material of the webbing may contain traces of the occupant's clothing.
Certain materials such as nylons may become permanently affixed or melted onto the fabric as a result of heat produced by friction, whereas fiber based clothing leaves no remains on modern webbing.
A two-point belt attaches at its two endpoints.
A simple strap was first used March 12, 1910, by pilot Benjamin Foulois, a pioneering aviator with the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, so he might remain at the controls during turbulence.
The Irvin Air Chute Company made the seat belt for use by professional race car driver Barney Oldfield when his team decided the daredevil should have a "safety harness" for the 1923 Indianapolis 500.
A lap belt is a strap that goes over the waist.
This was the most common type of belt prior to legislation requiring three-point belts and is found in older cars.
Coaches are equipped with lap belts (although many newer coaches have three-point belts), as are passenger aircraft seats.
University of Minnesota professor James J. (Crash) Ryan was the inventor of, and held the patent for, the automatic retractable lap safety belt.
Ralph Nader cited Ryan's work in Unsafe at Any Speed and, following hearings led by Senator Abraham Ribicoff, President Lyndon Johnson signed two bills in 1966 requiring safety belts in all passenger vehicles starting in 1968.
Until the 1980s, three-point belts were commonly available only in the front outboard seats of cars; the back seats were often only fitted with lap belts.
Evidence of the potential of lap belts to cause separation of the lumbar vertebrae and the sometimes-associated paralysis, or "seat belt syndrome" led to the progressive revision of passenger safety regulations in nearly all developed countries to require three-point belts, first in all outboard seating positions, and eventually in all seating positions in passenger vehicles.
Since September 1, 2007, all new cars sold in the U.S. require a lap and shoulder belt in the center rear seat.
In addition to regulatory changes, "seat belt syndrome" has led to a liability for vehicle manufacturers.
One Los Angeles case resulted in a $45 million jury verdict against Ford; the resulting $30 million judgment (after deductions for another defendant who settled prior to trial) was affirmed on appeal in 2006.
While lap belts are exceedingly rare to spot in modern cars, they are the standard in commercial airliners.
The lift-lever style of commercial aircraft buckles allows for the seatbelt to be easily clasped and unclasped, accessible quickly in case of an emergency where a passenger must evacuate, and fulfills the minimum safety requirements provided by the FAA while remaining low-cost to produce.
Furthermore, in case of any collision, a passenger in economy class has only around 9 inches for their head to travel forward, meaning restraining the torso and head is relatively unnecessary as the head has little room to accelerate before collision.
A "sash" or shoulder harness is a strap that goes diagonally over the vehicle occupant's outboard shoulder and is buckled inboard of their lap.
The shoulder harness may attach to the lap belt tongue, or it may have a tongue and buckle completely separate from those of the lap belt.
Shoulder harnesses of this separate or semi-separate type were installed in conjunction with lap belts in the outboard front seating positions of many vehicles in the North American market starting at the inception of the shoulder belt requirement of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 on January 1, 1968.
However, if the shoulder strap is used without the lap belt, the vehicle occupant is likely to "submarine", or slide forward in the seat and out from under the belt, in a frontal collision.
In the mid-1970s, three-point belt systems such as Chrysler's "Uni-Belt" began to supplant the separate lap and shoulder belts in American-made cars, though such three-point belts had already been supplied in European vehicles such as Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and Saab for some years.
A three-point belt is a Y-shaped arrangement, similar to the separate lap and sash belts, but unified.
Like the separate lap-and-sash belt, in a collision, the three-point belt spreads out the energy of the moving body over the chest, pelvis, and shoulders.
Volvo introduced the first production three-point belt in 1959.
The first car with a three-point belt was a Volvo PV 544 that was delivered to a dealer in Kristianstad on August 13, 1959.
The first car model to have the three-point seat belt as a standard item was the 1959 Volvo 122, first outfitted with a two-point belt at initial delivery in 1958, replaced with the three-point seat belt the following year.
The three-point belt was developed by Nils Bohlin, who had earlier also worked on ejection seats at Saab.
Volvo then made the new seat belt design patent open in the interest of safety and made it available to other car manufacturers for free.
The Belt-in-Seat (BIS) is a three-point harness with the shoulder belt attached to the seat itself, rather than to the vehicle structure.
The first car using this system was the Range Rover Classic, which offered BIS as standard on the front seats from 1970.
Some cars like the Renault Vel Satis use this system for the front seats.
A General Motors assessment concluded seat-mounted three-point belts offer better protection especially to smaller vehicle occupants, though GM did not find a safety performance improvement in vehicles with seat-mounted belts versus belts mounted to the vehicle body.
Belt-in-Seat type belts have been used by automakers in convertibles and pillarless hardtops, where there is no "B" pillar to affix the upper mount of the belt.
Chrysler and Cadillac are well known for using this design.
Antique auto enthusiasts sometimes replace original seats in their cars with BIS-equipped front seats, providing a measure of safety not available when these cars were new.
However, modern BIS systems typically use electronics that must be installed and connected with the seats and the vehicle's electrical system in order to function properly.
Five-point harnesses are typically found in child safety seats and in racing cars.
The lap portion is connected to a belt between the legs and there are two shoulder belts, making a total of five points of attachment to the seat.
A 4-point harness is similar, but without the strap between the legs, while a 6-point harness has two belts between the legs.
In NASCAR, the 6-point harness became popular after the death of Dale Earnhardt, who was wearing a five-point harness when he suffered his fatal crash.
As it was first thought that his belt had broken, and broke his neck at impact, some teams ordered a six-point harness in response.
Aerobatic aircraft frequently use a combination harness consisting of a five-point harness with a redundant lap belt attached to a different part of the aircraft.
While providing redundancy for negative-g maneuvers (which lift the pilot out of the seat), they also require the pilot to unlatch two harnesses if it is necessary to parachute from a failed aircraft.
The purpose of locking retractors (sometimes called ELR belts, for "Emergency Locking Retractors") is to provide the seated occupant the convenience of some free movement of the upper torso within the compartment while providing a method of limiting this movement in the event of a crash.
Starting in 1996, all passenger vehicles were required to lock pre-crash, meaning they have a locking mechanism in the retractor or in the latch plate.
Seat belts are stowed on spring-loaded reels called "retractors" equipped with inertial locking mechanisms that stop the belt from extending off the reel during severe deceleration.
There are two main types of inertial seat belt locks.
A webbing-sensitive lock is based on a centrifugal clutch activated by the rapid acceleration of the strap (webbing) from the reel.
The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually, as when the occupant extends the belt to fasten it.
A sudden rapid pull of the belt—as in a sudden braking or collision event—causes the reel to lock, restraining the occupant in position.
The first automatic locking retractor for seat belts and shoulder harnesses in the U.S. was the Irving "Dynalock" safety device.
These "Auto-lock" front lap belts were optional on AMC cars with bucket seats in 1967.
A vehicle-sensitive lock is based on a pendulum swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle.
In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel.
The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant.
When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position.
Dual-sensing locking retractors use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.
Seat belts in many newer vehicles are also equipped with "pretensioners" or "web clamps", or both.
Pretensioners preemptively tighten the belt to prevent the occupant from jerking forward in a crash.
Mercedes-Benz first introduced pretensioners on the 1981 S-Class.
In the event of a crash, a pretensioner will tighten the belt almost instantaneously.
This reduces the motion of the occupant in a violent crash.
Like airbags, pretensioners are triggered by sensors in the car's body, and many pretensioners have used explosively expanding gas to drive a piston that retracts the belt.
Pretensioners also lower the risk of "submarining", which occurs when a passenger slides forward under a loosely fitted seat belt.
Some systems also pre-emptively tighten the belt during fast accelerations and strong decelerations, even if no crash has happened.
This has the advantage that it may help prevent the driver from sliding out of position during violent evasive maneuvers, which could cause loss of control of the vehicle.
These pre-emptive safety systems may prevent some collisions from happening, as well as reduce injuries in the event an actual collision occurs.
Pre-emptive systems generally use electric pretensioners, which can operate repeatedly and for a sustained period, rather than pyrotechnic pretensioners, which can only operate a single time.
Webclamps stop the webbing in the event of an accident and limit the distance the webbing can spool out (caused by the unused webbing tightening on the central drum of the mechanism).
These belts also often incorporate an energy management loop ("rip stitching") in which a section of the webbing is looped and stitched with special stitching.
The function of this is to "rip" at a predetermined load, which reduces the maximum force transmitted through the belt to the occupant during a violent collision, reducing injuries to the occupant.
A study demonstrated that standard automotive three-point restraints fitted with pyrotechnic or electric pretensioners were not able to eliminate all interior passenger compartment head strikes in rollover test conditions.
Electric pretensioners are often incorporated on vehicles equipped with precrash systems; they are designed to reduce seat belt slack in a potential collision and assist in placing the occupants in a more optimal seating position.
The electric pretensioners also can operate on a repeated or sustained basis, providing better protection in the event of an extended rollover or a multiple collision accident.
The inflatable seat belt was invented by Donald Lewis and tested at the Automotive Products Division of Allied Chemical Corporation.
Inflatable seat belts have tubular inflatable bladders contained within an outer cover.
When a crash occurs, the bladder inflates with gas to increase the area of the restraint contacting the occupant and also shortening the length of the restraint to tighten the belt around the occupant, improving the protection.
The inflatable sections may be shoulder-only or lap and shoulder.
The system supports the head during the crash better than a web-only belt.
It also provides side impact protection.
In 2013, Ford began offering rear-seat inflatable seat belts on a limited set of models, such as the Explorer and Flex.
Seat belts that automatically move into position around a vehicle occupant once the adjacent door is closed and/or the engine is started were developed as a countermeasure against low usage rates of manual seat belts, particularly in the United States.
The 1972 Volkswagen ESVW1 Experimental Safety Vehicle presented passive seat belts.
Volvo tried to develop a passive three point seat belt.
In 1973, Volkswagen announced they had a functional passive seat belt.
The first commercial car to use automatic seat belts was the 1975 Volkswagen Golf.
Automatic seat belts received a boost in the United States in 1977 when Brock Adams, United States Secretary of Transportation in the Carter Administration, mandated that by 1983 every new car should have either airbags or automatic seat belts.
There was strong lobbying against the passive restraint requirement by the auto industry.
Adams was criticized by Ralph Nader, who said that the 1983 deadline was too late.
The Volkswagen Rabbit also had automatic seat belts, and VW said that by early 1978, 90,000 cars had sold with them.
General Motors introduced a three-point non-motorized passive belt system in 1980 to comply with the passive restraint requirement.
However, it was used as an active lap-shoulder belt because of unlatching the belt to exit the vehicle.
Despite this common practice, field studies of belt use still showed an increase in wearing rates with this door-mounted system.
General Motors began offering automatic seat belts on the Chevrolet Chevette.
However, the company reported disappointing sales because of this feature.
For the 1981 model year, the new Toyota Cressida became the first car to offer motorized automatic passive seat belts.
A study released in 1978 by the United States Department of Transportation said that cars with automatic seat belts had a fatality rate of .78 per 100 million miles, compared with 2.34 for cars with regular, manual belts.
In 1981, Drew Lewis, the first Transportation Secretary of the Reagan Administration, influenced by studies done by the auto industry, dropped the mandate; the decision was overruled in a federal appeals court the following year, and then by the Supreme Court.
In 1984, the Reagan Administration reversed its course, though in the meantime the original deadline had been extended; Elizabeth Dole, then Transportation Secretary, proposed that the two passive safety restraints be phased into vehicles gradually, from vehicle model year 1987 to vehicle model year 1990, when all vehicles would be required to have either automatic seat belts or driver side air bags.
Though more awkward for vehicle occupants, most manufacturers opted to use less expensive automatic belts rather than airbags during this time period.
When driver side airbags became mandatory on all passenger vehicles in model year 1995, most manufacturers stopped equipping cars with automatic seat belts.
Exceptions include the 1995–96 Ford Escort/Mercury Tracer and the Eagle Summit Wagon, which had automatic safety belts along with dual airbags.
Manual lap belt with automatic motorized shoulder belt: When the door is opened, the shoulder belt moves from a fixed point near the seat back on a track mounted in the door frame of the car to a point at the other end of the track near the windshield.
Once the door is closed and the car is started, the belt moves rearward along the track to its original position, thus securing the passenger.
The lap belt must be fastened manually.
Manual lap belt with automatic non-motorized shoulder belt: This system was used in American-market vehicles such as the Hyundai Excel and Volkswagen Jetta.
The shoulder belt is fixed to the aft upper corner of the vehicle door and is not motorized.
The lap belt must be fastened manually.
Automatic shoulder and lap belts: This system was mainly used in General Motors vehicles, though it was also used on some Honda Civic hatchbacks and Nissan Sentra coupes.
When the door is opened, the belts go from a fixed point in the middle of the car by the floor to the retractors on the door.
Passengers must slide into the car under the belts.
When the door closes, the seat belt retracts into the door.
The belts have normal release buttons that are supposed to be used only in an emergency, but in practice are routinely used in the same manner as manual seat belt clasps.
This system also found use by American Specialty Cars when they created the 1991-1994 convertible special edition of the Nissan 240SX, a car that traditionally had a motorized shoulder belt.
Automatic belt systems generally offer inferior occupant crash protection.
In systems with belts attached to the door rather than a sturdier fixed portion of the vehicle body, a crash that causes the vehicle door to open leaves the occupant without belt protection.
In such a scenario, the occupant may be thrown from the vehicle and suffer greater injury or death.
Because many automatic belt system designs compliant with the U.S. passive-restraint mandate did not meet the  anchorage requirements of Canada (CMVSS 210) — which were not weakened to accommodate automatic belts — vehicle models that had been eligible for easy importation in either direction across the U.S.-Canada border when equipped with manual belts became ineligible for importation in either direction once the U.S. variants obtained automatic belts and the Canadian versions retained manual belts.
Two particular models affected were the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim.
Automatic belt systems also present several operational disadvantages.
Motorists who would normally wear seat belts must still fasten the manual lap belt, thus rendering redundant the automation of the shoulder belt.
Those who do not fasten the lap belt wind up inadequately protected only by the shoulder belt.
In a crash, without a lap belt, such a vehicle occupant is likely to "submarine" (be thrown forward under the shoulder belt) and be seriously injured.
Motorized or door-affixed shoulder belts hinder access to the vehicle, making it difficult to enter and exit—particularly if the occupant is carrying items such as a box or a purse.
Vehicle owners tend to disconnect the motorized or door-affixed shoulder belt to relieve the nuisance when entering and exiting the vehicle, leaving only a lap belt for crash protection.
Also, many automatic seat belt systems are incompatible with child safety seats, or only compatible with special modifications.
Starting in 1971 and ending in 1972, the United States conducted a research project on seat belt effectiveness on a total of 40,000 vehicle occupants using car accident reports collected during that time.
Of these 40,000 occupants, 18% were reported wearing lap belts, or two-point safety belts, 2% were reported wearing a three-point safety belt, and the remaining 80% were reported as wearing no safety belt.
The results concluded that users of the two-point lap belt had a 73% lower fatality rate, a 53% lower serious injury rate, and a 38% lower injury rate than the occupants that were reported unrestrained.
Similarly, users of the three-point safety belt had a 60% lower serious injury rate and a 41% lower rate of all other injuries.
Out of the 2% described as wearing a three-point safety belt, no fatalities were reported.
This study and others led to the Restraint Systems Evaluation Program (RSEP), started by the NHTSA in 1975 to increase the reliability and authenticity of past studies.
A study as part of this program used data taken from 15,000 tow-away accidents that involved only car models made between 1973 and 1975.
The study found that for injuries considered “moderate” or worse, individuals wearing a three-point safety belt had a 56.5% lower injury rate than those wearing no safety belt.
The study also concluded that the effectiveness of the safety belt did not differ with the size of a car.
It was determined that the variation among results of the many studies conducted in the 1960s and 70s was due to the use of different methodologies, and could not be attributed to any significant variation in the effectiveness of safety belts.
Wayne State University's Automotive Safety Research Group, as well as other researchers, are testing ways to improve seat belt effectiveness and general vehicle safety apparatuses.
Wayne State's Bioengineering Center uses human cadavers in their crash test research.
The Center's director, Albert King, wrote in 1995 that the vehicle safety improvements made possible since 1987 by the use of cadavers in research had saved nearly 8,500 lives each year, and indicated that improvements made to three-point safety belts save an average of 61 lives every year.
The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) was put in place by the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1979.
The NCAP is a government program that evaluates vehicle safety designs and sets standards for foreign and domestic automobile companies.
The agency developed a rating system and requires access to safety test results.
As of September 2007, manufacturers are required to place an NCAP star rating on the automobile price sticker.
In 2004, The European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP), started testing seat belts and whiplash safety on all test cars at the Thatcham Research Centre with crash test dummies.
Criss-cross: Experimental safety belt presented in the Volvo SCC.
It forms a cross-brace across the chest.
3+2 Point: Experimental safety belt from Autoliv similar to the criss-cross.
The 3+2 improves protection against rollovers and side impacts.
Four point "belt and suspenders": An experimental design from Ford where the "suspenders" are attached to the backrest, not to the frame of the car.
3-point Adjustable: Experimental safety belt from GWR Safety Systems that allowed the car Hiriko, designed by MIT, to fold without compromising the safety and comfort of the occupants.
In 1955 (as a 1956 package), Ford offered lap-only seat belts in the rear seats as an option within the Lifeguard safety package.
In 1967, Volvo started to install lap belts in the rear seats.
In 1972, Volvo upgraded the rear seat belts to a three-point belt.
In crashes, unbelted rear passengers increase the risk of belted front seat occupants' death by nearly five times.
As with adult drivers and passengers, the advent of seat belts was accompanied by calls for their use by child occupants, including legislation requiring such use.
Generally, children using adult seat belts suffer significantly lower injury risk when compared to non-buckled children.
In Europe, the U.S., and some other parts of the world, most modern cars include a seat-belt reminder light for the driver and some also include a reminder for the passenger, when present, activated by a pressure sensor under the passenger seat.
Some cars will intermittently flash the reminder light and sound the chime until the driver (and sometimes the front passenger, if present) fasten their seat belts.
In 2005, in Sweden, 70% of all cars that were newly registered were equipped with seat belt reminders for the driver.
Since November 2014, seat belt reminders are mandatory for the driver's seat on new cars sold in Europe.
Two specifications define the standard of seat belt reminder: UN Regulation 16, Section 8.4 and the Euro NCAP assessment protocol (Euro NCAP, 2013).
In the European Union, seat belt reminders are mandatory in all new passenger cars for the driver seat.
In 2014, EC Regulation 661/2009 made UN Regulation 16 applicable.
all front seats of buses and trucks.
This improvement applies from 1 September 2019 for new types of motor vehicles and from 1 September 2021 for all new motor vehicles.
The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard № 208 (FMVSS 208) was amended by the NHTSA to require a seat belt/starter interlock system to prevent passenger cars from being started with an unbelted front-seat occupant.
This mandate applied to passenger cars built after August 1973, i.e., starting with the 1974 model year.
The specifications required the system to permit the car to be started only if the belt of an occupied seat were fastened after the occupant sat down, so pre-buckling the belts would not defeat the system.
The interlock systems used logic modules complex enough to require special diagnostic computers, and were not entirely dependable—an override button was provided under the hood of equipped cars, permitting one (but only one) "free" starting attempt each time it was pressed.
However, the interlock system spurred severe backlash from an American public who largely rejected seat belts.
In 1974, Congress acted to prohibit NHTSA from requiring or permitting a system that prevents a vehicle from starting or operating with an unbelted occupant, or that gives an audible warning of an unfastened belt for more than 8 seconds after the ignition is turned on.
This prohibition took effect on 27 October 1974, shortly after the 1975 model year began.
In response to the Congressional action, NHTSA once again amended FMVSS 208, requiring vehicles to come with a seat belt reminder system that gives an audible signal for 4 to 8 seconds and a warning light for at least 60 seconds after the ignition is turned on if the driver's seat belt is not fastened.
This is called a seat belt reminder (SBR) system.
In the mid-1990s, the Swedish insurance company Folksam worked with Saab and Ford to determine the requirements for the most efficient seat belt reminder.
One characteristic of the optimal SBR, according to the research, is that the audible warning becomes increasingly penetrating the longer the seat belt remains unfastened.
In 2001, Congress directed NHSTA to study the benefits of technology meant to increase the use of seat belts.
NHSTA found that seat belt usage had increased to 73% since the initial introduction of the SBR system.
In 2002, Ford demonstrated that seat belts were used more in Fords with seat belt reminders than in those without: 76% and 71% respectively.
In 2007, Honda conducted a similar study and found that 90% of people who drove Hondas with seat belt reminders used a seat belt, while 84% of people who drove Hondas without seat belt reminders used a seat belt.
In 2003, the Transportation Research Board Committee, chaired by two psychologists, reported that "Enhanced SBRs" (ESBRs) could save an additional 1,000 lives a year.
Research by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that Ford's ESBR, which provides an intermittent chime for up to five minutes if the driver is unbelted, sounding for 6 seconds then pausing for 30, increased seat belt use by 5 percentage points.
Farmer and Wells found that driver fatality rates were 6% lower for vehicles with ESBR compared with otherwise-identical vehicles without.
Starting with the 2020 model year, some Chevrolet cars refused to shift from Park to Drive for 20 seconds if the driver is unbuckled and the car is in "teen driver" mode.
A similar feature was previously available on some General Motors fleet cars.
In observational studies of car crash morbidity and mortality, experiments using both crash test dummies and human cadavers indicate that wearing seat belts greatly reduces the risk of death and injury in the majority of car crashes.
This has led many countries to adopt mandatory seat belt wearing laws.
It is generally accepted that, in comparing like-for-like accidents, a vehicle occupant not wearing a properly fitted seat belt has a significantly and substantially higher chance of death and serious injury.
One large observation studying using U.S. data showed that the odds ratio of crash death is 0.46 with a three-point belt when compared with no belt.
In another study that examined injuries presenting to the ER pre- and post-seat belt law introduction, it was found that 40% more escaped injury and 35% more escaped mild and moderate injuries.
As of 2016, seat belt laws can be divided into two categories: primary and secondary.
A primary seat belt law allows an officer to issue a citation for lack of seat belt use without any other citation, whereas a secondary seat belt law allows an officer to issue a seat belt citation only in the presence of a different violation.
In the United States, fifteen states enforce secondary laws, while 34 states, as well as the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands enforce primary seat belt laws.
New Hampshire lacks either a primary or secondary seat belt law.
Some have proposed that the number of deaths was influenced by the development of risk compensation, which says that drivers adjust their behavior in response to the increased sense of personal safety wearing a seat belt provides.
In one trial subjects were asked to drive go-karts around a track under various conditions.
It was found that subjects who started driving unbelted drove consistently faster when subsequently belted.
Similarly, a study of habitual non-seat belt wearers driving in freeway conditions found evidence that they had adapted to  use by adopting higher driving speeds and closer following distances.
A 2001 analysis of U.S. crash data aimed to establish the effects of  legislation on driving fatalities and found that previous estimates of seat belt effectiveness had been significantly overstated.
According to the analysis, seat belts decreased fatalities by 1.35% for each 10% increase in seat belt use.
The study controlled for endogenous motivations of seat belt use, because that creates an artificial correlation between seat belt use and fatalities, leading to the conclusion that seat belts cause fatalities.
For example, drivers in high-risk areas are more likely to use seat belts and are more likely to be in accidents, creating a non-causal correlation between seat belt use and mortality.
After accounting for the endogeneity of seat belt usage, Cohen and Einav found no evidence that the risk compensation effect makes seat belt-wearing drivers more dangerous, a finding at variance with other research.
Other statistical analyses have included adjustments for factors such as increased traffic and age, and based on these adjustments, which results in a reduction of morbidity and mortality due to seat belt use.
However, Smeed's law predicts a fall in accident rate with increasing car ownership and has been demonstrated independently of seat belt legislation.
In the U.S., six states—California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, and Texas—require seat belts on school buses.
Pros and cons have been debated about the use of seat belts in school buses.
School buses, which are much bigger than the average vehicle, allow for the mass transportation of students from place to place.
The American School Bus Council states in a brief article: "The children are protected like eggs in an egg carton—compartmentalized, and surrounded with padding and structural integrity to secure the entire container."
Although school buses are considered safe for mass transit of students, this will not guarantee that the students will be injury-free if an impact were to occur.
Seat belts in buses are sometimes believed to make recovering from a roll or tip harder for passengers, as they could be easily trapped in their own safety belts.
In 2015, for the first time, NHTSA endorsed seat belts on school buses.
In the European Union, all new long-distance buses and coaches must be fitted with seat belts.
Australia has required lap/sash seat belts in new coaches since 1994.
These must comply with Australian Design Rule 68, which requires the seat belt, seat and seat anchorage to withstand 20g deceleration and an impact by an unrestrained occupant to the rear.
In the United States, NHTSA now requires lap-shoulder seat belts in new "over-the-road" buses (includes most coaches) starting in 2016.
The use of seat belts in trains has been investigated.
Concerns about survival space intrusion in train crashes and increased injuries to unrestrained or incorrectly restrained passengers led researchers to discourage the use of seat belts in trains.
All aerobatic aircraft and gliders (sailplanes) are fitted with four or five-point harnesses, as are many types of light aircraft and many types of military aircraft.
The seat belts in these aircraft have the dual function of crash protection and keeping the pilot(s) and crew in their seat(s) during turbulence and aerobatic maneuvers.
Passenger aircraft are fitted with lap belts.
Unlike road vehicles, passenger aircraft seat belts are not primarily designed for crash protection.
Their main purpose is to keep passengers in their seats during events such as turbulence.
Many civil aviation authorities require a "fasten seat belt" sign in passenger aircraft that can be activated by a pilot during takeoff, turbulence, and landing.
The International Civil Aviation Organization recommends the use of child restraints.
Some airline authorities, including the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), permit the use of airline infant lap belts  (sometimes known as an infant loop or belly belt) to secure an infant under age two sitting on an adult's lap.
A shock absorber or damper is a mechanical or hydraulic device designed to absorb and damp shock impulses.
It does this by converting the kinetic energy of the shock into another form of energy (typically heat) which is then dissipated.
Most shock absorbers are a form of dashpot (a damper which resists motion via viscous friction).
Pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs.
An automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston (see below).
One design consideration, when designing or choosing a shock absorber, is where that energy will go.
In most shock absorbers, energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid.
In hydraulic cylinders, the hydraulic fluid heats up, while in air cylinders, the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere.
In other types of shock absorbers, such as electromagnetic types, the dissipated energy can be stored and used later.
In general terms, shock absorbers help cushion vehicles on uneven roads and keep wheels in contact with the ground.
In a vehicle, shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground, leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling.
While shock absorbers serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement, their intended main purpose is to damp spring oscillations.
Shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs.
Spring rates are chosen by the manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicle, loaded and unloaded.
Some people use shocks to modify spring rates but this is not the correct use.
Along with hysteresis in the tire itself, they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down.
Effective wheel bounce damping may require tuning shocks to an optimal resistance.
Spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs, though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well.
Ideal springs alone, however, are not shock absorbers, as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy.
Vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars.
In this combination, "shock absorber" refers specifically to the hydraulic piston that absorbs and dissipates vibration.
Now, composite suspension systems are used mainly in 2 wheelers and also leaf springs are made up of composite material in 4 wheelers.
Shock absorbers are an important part of car suspension designed to increase comfort, stability and overall safety.
The shock absorber, produced with precision and engineering skills, has many important features.
The most common type is a hydraulic shock absorber, which usually includes a piston, a cylinder, and an oil-filled chamber.
The piston is connected to the piston rod, which extends into the cylinder and divides the cylinder into two parts.
One chamber is filled with hydraulic oil, while the other chamber contains compressed oil or air.
When there is an accident or vibration in the vehicle, the piston moves into the cylinder, forcing the hydraulic fluid through small holes, creating resistance and dissipating energy in the form of heat.
This dampens oscillations, reducing further bouncing or wobble of the car.
Shock construction requires a balance of features such as piston design, fluid viscosity, and overall size of the unit to ensure performance.
As technology developed, other types of shock absorbers emerged, including gas and electric shock absorbers, that provided improved control and flexibility.
The design and manufacture of shock absorbers is constantly evolving due to the continuous improvement of vehicle dynamics and passenger comfort.
In common with carriages and railway locomotives, most early motor vehicles used leaf springs.
One of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping, and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension, the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was "impossible" to use them as main springs.
However the amount of damping provided by leaf spring friction was limited and variable according to the conditions of the springs, and whether wet or dry.
It also operated in both directions.
Motorcycle front suspension adopted coil sprung Druid forks from about 1906, and similar designs later added Friction disk shock absorber rotary friction dampers, which damped both ways - but they were adjustable (e.g. 1924 Webb forks).
These friction disk shock absorber s was also fitted to many cars.
One of the problems with motor cars was the large variation in sprung weight between lightly loaded and fully loaded, especially for the rear springs.
When heavily loaded the springs could bottom out, and apart from fitting rubber 'bump stops', there were attempts to use heavy main springs with auxiliary springs to smooth the ride when lightly loaded, which were often called 'shock absorbers'.
Realizing that the spring and vehicle combination bounced with a characteristic frequency, these auxiliary springs were designed with a different period, but were not a solution to the problem that the spring rebound after striking a bump could throw you out of your seat.
What was called for was damping that operated on the rebound.
Although C.L. Horock came up with a design in 1901 that had hydraulic damping, it worked in one direction only.
It does not seem to have gone into production right away, whereas mechanical dampers such as the Gabriel Snubber started being fitted in the late 1900s (also the similar Stromberg Anti-Shox).
These used a belt coiled inside a device such that it freely wound in under the action of a coiled spring but met friction when drawn out.
Gabriel Snubbers were fitted to an 11.9HP Arrol-Johnston car which broke the 6 hour Class B record at Brooklands in late 1912, and the Automator journal noted that this snubber might have a great future for racing due to its light weight and easy fitment.
One of the earliest hydraulic dampers to go into production was the Telesco Shock Absorber, exhibited at the 1912 Olympia Motor Show and marketed by Polyrhoe Carburettors Ltd.
This contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers' mentioned above, but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction.
The Telesco unit was fitted at the rear end of the leaf spring, in place of the rear spring to chassis mount, so that it formed part of the springing system, albeit a hydraulically damped part.
This layout was presumably selected as it was easy to apply to existing vehicles, but it meant the hydraulic damping was not applied to the action of the main leaf spring, but only to the action of the auxiliary spring in the unit itself.
The first production hydraulic dampers to act on the main leaf spring movement were probably those based on an original concept by Maurice Houdaille patented in 1908 and 1909.
These used a lever arm which moved hydraulically damped vanes inside the unit.
The main advantage over the friction disk dampers was that it would resist sudden movement but allow slow movement, whereas the rotary friction dampers tended to stick and then offer the same resistance regardless of speed of movement.
There appears to have been little progress on commercialising the lever arm shock absorbers until after World War I, after which they came into widespread use, for example as standard equipment on the 1927 Ford Model A and manufactured by Houde Engineering Corporation of Buffalo, NY.
Most vehicular shock absorbers are either twin-tube or mono-tube types with some variations on these themes.
Also known as a "two-tube" shock absorber, this device consists of two nested cylindrical tubes, an inner tube that is called the "working tube" or the "pressure tube", and an outer tube called the "reserve tube".
At the bottom of the device on the inside is a compression valve or base valve.
When the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road, hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or "orifices" in the piston and via the valve, converting the "shock" energy into heat which must then be dissipated.
Variously known as a "gas cell two-tube" or similarly-named design, this variation represented a significant advancement over the basic twin-tube form.
Its overall structure is very similar to the twin-tube, but a low-pressure charge of nitrogen gas is added to the reserve tube.
The result of this alteration is a dramatic reduction in "foaming" or "aeration", the undesirable outcome of a twin-tube overheating and failing which presents as foaming hydraulic fluid dripping out of the assembly.
Twin-tube gas charged shock absorbers represent the vast majority of original modern vehicle suspension installations.
Often abbreviated simply as "PSD", this design is another evolution of the twin-tube shock.
In a PSD shock absorber, which still consists of two nested tubes and still contains nitrogen gas, a set of grooves has been added to the pressure tube.
These grooves allow the piston to move relatively freely in the middle range of travel (i.e., the most common street or highway use, called by engineers the "comfort zone") and to move with significantly less freedom in response to shifts to more irregular surfaces when upward and downward movement of the piston starts to occur with greater intensity (i.e., on bumpy sections of roads— the stiffening gives the driver greater control of movement over the vehicle so its range on either side of the comfort zone is called the "control zone").
This advance allowed car designers to make a shock absorber tailored to specific makes and models of vehicles and to take into account a given vehicle's size and weight, its maneuverability, its horsepower, etc. in creating a correspondingly effective shock.
The next phase in shock absorber evolution was the development of a shock absorber that could sense and respond to not just situational changes from "bumpy" to "smooth" but to individual bumps in the road in a near instantaneous reaction.
This was achieved through a change in the design of the compression valve, and has been termed "acceleration sensitive damping" or "ASD".
Not only does this result in a complete disappearance of the "comfort vs. control" tradeoff, it also reduced pitch during vehicle braking and roll during turns.
However, ASD shocks are usually only available as aftermarket changes to a vehicle and are only available from a limited number of manufacturers.
Coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring.
They are common on motorcycles and scooter rear suspensions, and widely used on front and rear suspensions in cars.
The principal design alternative to the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s.
As its name implies, the mono-tube shock, which is also a gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format, consists of only one tube, the pressure tube, though it has two pistons.
These pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston, and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness.
The two pistons also completely separate the shock's fluid and gas components.
The mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes, making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks.
However, unlike the twin-tubes, the mono-tube shock can be mounted either way— it does not have any directionality.
It also does not have a compression valve, whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston, and although it contains nitrogen gas, the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure (260-360 p.s.i. or so) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle's weight, something which no other shock absorber is designed to do.
Mercedes became the first auto manufacturer to install mono-tube shocks as standard equipment on some of their cars starting in 1958.
They were manufactured by Bilstein, patented the design and first appeared in 1954s.
Because the design was patented, no other manufacturer could use it until 1971 when the patent expired.
Spool valve dampers are characterized by the use of hollow cylindrical sleeves with machined-in oil passages as opposed to traditional conventional flexible discs or shims.
Spool valving can be applied with monotube, twin-tube, and/or position-sensitive packaging, and is compatible with electronic control.
Primary among benefits cited in Multimatic’s 2010 patent filing is the elimination of performance ambiguity associated with flexible shims, resulting in mathematically predictable, repeatable, and robust pressure-flow characteristics.
An extra tube or container of oil connected to the oil compartment of the (main) shock via a flexible pipe (remote reservoir) or inflexible pipe (piggy-back shock).
Increases the amount of oil a shock can carry without increasing its length or thickness.
Allows each section of suspension travel to have an independent suspension tune.
Bypass shock, double bypass shock, triple bypass shock etc.
Triple bypass would have a separate set of suspension tuning controls for each of it's three sections of suspension travel: initial travel, mid-travel, full-travel.
Hysteresis of structural material, for example the compression of rubber disks, stretching of rubber bands and cords, bending of steel springs, or twisting of torsion bars.
Hysteresis is the tendency for otherwise elastic materials to rebound with less force than was required to deform them.
Simple vehicles with no separate shock absorbers are damped, to some extent, by the hysteresis of their springs and frames.
Dry friction as used in wheel brakes, by using disks (classically made of leather) at the pivot of a lever, with friction forced by springs.
Used in early automobiles such as the Ford Model T, up through some British cars of the 1940s and on the French Citroën 2CV in the 1950s.
Although now considered obsolete, an advantage of this system is its mechanical simplicity; the degree of damping can be easily adjusted by tightening or loosening the screw clamping the disks, and it can be easily rebuilt with simple hand tools.
A disadvantage is that the damping force tends not to increase with the speed of the vertical motion.
Fluid friction, for example the flow of fluid through a narrow orifice (hydraulics), constitutes the vast majority of automotive shock absorbers.
This design first appeared on Mors racing cars in 1902.
One advantage of this type is, by using special internal valving, the absorber may be made relatively soft to compression (allowing a soft response to a bump) and relatively stiff to extension, controlling "rebound", which is the vehicle response to energy stored in the springs; similarly, a series of valves controlled by springs can change the degree of stiffness according to the velocity of the impact or rebound.
Specialized shock absorbers for racing purposes may allow the front end of a dragster to rise with minimal resistance under acceleration, then strongly resist letting it settle, thereby maintaining a desirable rearward weight distribution for enhanced traction.
Compression of a gas, for example pneumatic shock absorbers, which can act like springs as the air pressure is building to resist the force on it.
Enclosed gas is compressible, so equipment is less subject to shock damage.
This concept was first applied in series production on Citroën cars in 1954.
Today, many shock absorbers are pressurized with compressed nitrogen, to reduce the tendency for the oil to cavitate under heavy use.
This causes foaming which temporarily reduces the damping ability of the unit.
In very heavy duty units used for racing or off-road use, there may even be a secondary cylinder connected to the shock absorber to act as a reservoir for the oil and pressurized gas.
In aircraft landing gear, air shock absorbers may be combined with hydraulic damping to reduce bounce.
Such struts are called oleo struts (combining oil and air)
Inertial resistance to acceleration, the Citroën 2CV had shock absorbers that damp wheel bounce with no external moving parts.
These consisted of a spring-mounted 3.5 kg (7.75 lb) iron weight inside a vertical cylinder [4] and are similar to, yet much smaller than versions of the tuned mass dampers used on tall buildings.
Composite hydropneumatic suspension combines many suspension elements in a single device: spring action, shock absorption, ride-height control, and self leveling suspension.
This combines the advantages of gas compressibility and the ability of hydraulic machinery to apply force multiplication.
Conventional shock absorbers can be combined with air suspension springs - an alternate way to achieve ride-height control, and self leveling suspension.
In an electrorheological fluid damper, an electric field changes the viscosity of the oil.
This principle allows semi-active damper applications in automotive and various industries.
Magnetic field variation: a magnetorheological damper changes its fluid characteristics through an electromagnet.
The effect of a shock absorber at high (sound) frequencies is usually limited by using a compressible gas as the working fluid or mounting it with rubber bushings.
Some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber.
In more expensive vehicles the valves may be remotely adjustable, offering the driver control of the ride at will while the vehicle is operated.
Additional control can be provided by dynamic valve control via computer in response to sensors, giving both a smooth ride and a firm suspension when needed, allowing ride height adjustment or even ride height control.
Ride height control is especially desirable in highway vehicles intended for occasional rough road use, as a means of improving handling and reducing aerodynamic drag by lowering the vehicle when operating on improved high speed roads.
Unlike a shock absorber, a strut has a reinforced body and stem.
Struts are subjected to multidirectional loads, while a shock absorber only damps vibration, only receiving a load along its axis.
Struts and shock absorbers have a different way of attachment.
Shock absorbers are mounted through rubber or urethane bushings to the frame and suspension.
A strut is hard mounted to the suspension and is mounted to the frame through a rotating plate providing the upper pivot point of the steering.
Six-wheel drive (6WD or 6×6) is an all-wheel drive drivetrain configuration of three axles with at least two wheels on each axle capable of being driven simultaneously by the vehicle's engine.
Unlike four-wheel drive drivetrains, the configuration is largely confined to heavy-duty off-road and military vehicles, such as all-terrain vehicles, armored vehicles, and prime movers.
When such a vehicle only has six wheels by definition all are driven.
When it has ten – with two pairs of ganged "dual" wheels on each rear axle as on a GMC CCKW – all are also driven but the 6×6 designation remains.
For most military applications where traction/mobility are considered more important than payload capability, single wheels on each axle (often referred to as super singles) are the norm.
Heavy hauler and ballast tractor 6×6s have had a long history as prime movers both in the military (as tank transports and artillery tractors), and commercially in logging and heavy equipment hauling both on- and off-road.
Most six-wheel drive vehicles have a forward axle and two at the rear (with only the front pair steering), or three evenly spaced in varying steering configurations.
Depending on the vehicle's role, the number of wheels varies between six (in three pairs) and ten (with two in the front and two dual axles with four wheels apiece in the rear).
Drive may be limited to the rear two axles for on-road use.
Commercial 6×6 prime movers were made by Hayes Manufacturing and Pacific Trucks.
which also produced heavy haul ballast tractors.
The Freightliner Business Class M2 is a commercial medium-duty truck sold in the United States and available in a 6×6 configuration.
Six-by-six conversions of four-wheel drive trucks are made, such as the Australian Army's Perentie Land Rover Defender and "Landcruiser Sherman"), as are 6×4 versions (with only front and rear or front and middle axles driven).
Polaris Industries has produced a number of six-wheel drive ATVs and UTVs for many years, based on a standard Magnum, Sportsman or Ranger with an extra axle and a cargo box over the rear wheels.
Hennessey Ford VelociRaptor 6×6, with a 30-inch extended frame and six driven wheels.
6x6 Six Wheel Drive Jeep.
Fully custom chassis, body and drive-line.
(Twin axle) drive in the rear, and an integrated "roll steer" function built into the suspension design.
All 6x6 Australia Pty Ltd vehicles are ADR-compliant with IPA for both "heavy" and "light" vehicles.
Shared transport or shared mobility  is a transportation system where travelers share a vehicle either simultaneously as a group (e.g. ride-sharing) or over time (e.g. carsharing or bike sharing) as personal rental, and in the process share the cost of the journey, thus purportedly creating a hybrid between private vehicle use and mass or public transport.
It is a transportation strategy that allows users to access transportation services on an as-needed basis.
Shared mobility is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of transportation modes including carsharing, Bicycle-sharing systems, ridesharing companies, carpools, and microtransit.
Each shared mobility service has unique attributes that have a range of impacts on travel behavior, the environment, and the development of cities and urban areas.
Some impacts of shared mobility include enhanced transportation accessibility as well as reduced driving and decreased personal vehicle ownership.
Shared mobility programs often yield a variety of environmental, social, and transportation system benefits.
These are primarily related to personal vehicle usage and ownership, and vehicle miles or kilometers traveled (VMT/VKT).
Shared mobility networks also retain the potential to expand the reach of public transportation by addressed gaps in existing public transportation systems.
They can also provide economic benefits to users in the form of cost savings in some cases.
Shared transport  systems include carsharing (also called car clubs in the UK), bicycle sharing (also known as PBS or public bicycle systems), carpools and vanpools (aka ride-sharing or lift-sharing), real-time ridesharing, slugging (casual carpooling), community buses and vans, demand responsive transit (DRT), paratransit, a range of taxi projects and even hitchhiking and its numerous variants.
A somewhat different form of shared transport is the "shared taxi", a vehicle which follows a predetermined route and takes anybody waiting for it, more like a bus than a taxi.
Shared mobility is a subgroup of the larger sharing economy.
The sharing economy is a term that encompasses a wide variety of services, usually involving the online transactions of goods or services as part of a peer-to-peer marketplace.
Innovations in social networking, location-based services, and Internet technologies have enabled shared mobility to develop and expand rapidly.
By improving efficiency, providing cost savings, and monetizing underused resources, shared mobility services have become widely used in many cities around the world.
Although the proliferation of tech-enabled shared mobility has occurred mostly within the last decade, shared mobility services are not a new phenomenon.
The first carsharing program was established in 1948 in Zurich, Switzerland, and the first bikesharing program began in 1965 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
Smartphone applications and location data have increased the feasibility of shared transportation services, including carsharing companies and mobile app-based vehicle for hire companies.
Auto rickshaws carry people and goods in many developing countries.
Also known as a three-wheeler, Samosa, tempo, tuk-tuk, trishaw, auto, rickshaw, autorick, bajaj, rick, tricycle, mototaxi, baby taxi or lapa in popular parlance, they are motorized version of the traditional pulled rickshaw or cycle rickshaw.
They are an essential form of urban transport, both as vehicles for hire and for private use, in many developing countries, and a form of novelty transport in many Eastern countries.
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to access and use a shared fleet of bicycles, typically located within a given spatial boundary.
These systems are mostly concentrated in cities or other urban areas and bikes or stations are normally unattended and always accessible.
This availability during most or all of the day makes bikesharing an on-demand mobility option.
The first bikesharing system debuted in Amsterdam in 1965, under the name ‘White Bikes.’
The bicycles were left unlocked around the city to be used by anyone in need of transportation.
Bikesharing systems have since exploded in popularity starting in the mid-2000s due to advances in information technology (IT) that have improved bikesharing communications and tracking.
As of April 2016, there were 99 U.S. cities with technology-enabled public bikesharing systems, with approximately 32,200 bikes and 3,400 stations.
Three major types of bikesharing systems have emerged: public bikesharing (docked and dockless/free floating), closed campus bikesharing and peer-to-peer (P2P) bikesharing.
Most bikesharing systems are public and allow anyone to access a bicycle for a fee, typically in daily, monthly or annual membership fees.
Public bikesharing programs can be station-based (docked), or dockless (also known as free floating).
Dockless systems are deployed within a geo-fenced area.
Dockless systems were first introduced in Germany in the early 2000s via the Call a Bike program.
Major bikesharing operators in North America include: Motivate, Social Bicycles, Spin, ofo, Mobike, and LimeBike.
E-bikesharing systems (or Pedlec) have also been growing in popularity, particularly in Europe.
Social Bicycles began testing an e-bikesharing program, called Jump, in San Francisco in Summer 2017.
Studies have been conducted that analyze bikesharing impacts on modal shift.
A 2014 UC Berkeley study suggests that in larger cities, bikesharing programs remove riders from crowded or high-use bus transit systems.
In smaller cities, bikesharing improves access from bus lines, filling in gaps in the public transit system.
In addition, those living in larger cities report decreased rail usage as a result of increased cost savings and reduced travel times.
The study also found that half of the bikesharing members surveyed reduced their personal vehicle usage due to bikesharing.
Carsharing refers to a model of vehicle sharing where users access cars on an as-needed basis, and often pay by time of reservation or miles driven.
As of January 2015, there were 23 carsharing operators in the U.S. amounting to over 1.1 million members and over 16,000 vehicles.
As of January 2017, there were 39 carsharing organizations in North America serving 1.9 million members with a collective fleet of 24,629 vehicles.
(these numbers do not include P2P carsharing; they include roundtrip and one-way carsharing operations.).
Roundtrip carsharing is one of the earliest carsharing models, granting members  access to a shared vehicle fleet.
As the name suggests, roundtrip carsharing requires users to return to the same location where they accessed the vehicle.
One of the largest North American-based roundtrip carsharing operators is Zipcar, which operates more than 12,000 vehicles in urban areas on college campuses and at airports across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Belgium, Turkey and Taiwan.
There have been numerous studies that document behavioral changes associated with roundtrip carsharing programs.
A 2004 study on City CarShare in San Francisco, CA found that nearly 30% of members reduced car ownership by one of more cars; two-thirds of members reported that they opted not to purchase an additional vehicle.
This reduced car ownership typically translates into reduced driving, and thus lowered energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
Carsharing programs also affect usage patterns of other travel modes.
A 2011 study by UC Berkeley researchers found that roundtrip carsharing has a mixed impact on public transit and non-motorized modal use, with the same proportion of respondents increasing and decreasing usage of these modes.
The impact on carpooling and non-motorized transportation, however, was found to be positive.
The same study documented a 27% to 43% reduction in vehicle miles traveled and a 34% to 41% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions among households due to roundtrip carsharing.
One-way carsharing varies from roundtrip carsharing in that it grants members more flexibility in pickup and dropoff location.
In one-way carsharing—also known as point-to-point carsharing—members can access a vehicle at one location and end their trip in another location.
As of September 2015, companies that offered one-way functionality in the U.S. include car2go, GIG, ReachNow, Zipcar, and BlueIndy.
As of January 2015, about 35% of North American carsharing fleets were one-way capable.
A 2016 study of one-way carsharing operator, car2go, in five North American cities found that 2% to 5% of members sold a vehicle, and 7% to 10% postponed a vehicle purchase due to their carsharing membership.
Moreover, estimated VMT impacts due to carsharing ranged from −6% to −16% per car2go household, and GHG emissions changed by −4% to −18%.
Personal vehicle sharing (PVS) is a carsharing service model that allows short-term access to privately owned vehicles.
P2P carsharing, a subset of PVS, employs privately owned vehicles made available for shared usage by members of a P2P member base.
P2P carsharing companies differ from other carsharing operators in that users provide the free-floating vehicle fleet using their personally owned vehicles.
P2P carsharing operators in North America include Getaround and Turo (formerly RelayRides), and as of May 2015, there were eight active P2P operators in North America.
One 2014 study found that the top three reasons for using P2P carsharing are convenience and availability, monetary savings, and expanded mobility options.
Another study documented that personal vehicle sharing services can expand the geographic range of vehicle sharing services by renting underused autos and therefore lowering vehicle usage requirements.
However, fear of sharing personal assets was cited as one of the primary barriers to the adoption of P2P sharing services.
Ridesharing services enable shared rides between drivers and passengers that have similar origins and destination pairings.
Ridesharing includes both vanpooling and carpooling.
Vanpooling involves a grouping of between seven and 15 people traveling in a van, and carpooling refers to groups of less than seven people traveling together in one vehicle.
Ridesharing is distinct from ridesourcing (or TNCs), like Uber and Lyft in that the driver typically decides trip origin, destination, and any deviations to accommodate one or more additional passengers.
Drivers and riders have the same origin, destination, or potentially share multiple proximate destinations, with a common purpose of conserving resources, saving money, or saving time.
Driver earnings from ridesharing are regulated in the U.S. by the Internal Revenue Service, and as of January 2017, they were capped at 53.5 cents per mile for business travel by car.
Both technology-enabled ridesharing organizations and more informal ridesharing programs exist.
Examples of technology-enabled ridesharing companies are BlaBlaCar, Carma Carpool, Scoop, and Waze Carpool.
These services usually require participants to join either through a membership, website, or mobile application.
Potential drivers and riders can then post driving routes or preferred travel routes and the ridesharing service will connect riders with passengers that share similar origin destination pairings.
More informal ad hoc ridesharing programs include slugging (also known as casual carpooling).
Casual carpooling is an informal form of commuter ridesharing operating in Washington, D.C.; Houston, Texas; and San Francisco, California.
Casual carpooling has been in existence for over 30 years, is entirely run informally by its users, and does not use a mobile application or information communication technology.
In one study in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014, researchers interviewed, observed, and surveyed participants at multiple casual carpooling locations.
The study found that motivations for casual carpooling participation include: convenience, time savings, and monetary savings, while environmental and community-based motivations ranked low.
Casual carpooling is an efficient transportation option for these commuters, while environmental sustainability benefits are a positive byproduct.
Seventy-five percent of casual carpool users were previously public transit riders, and over 10% formerly drove alone.
In the U.S., the modal share of ridesharing has declined since the 1970s.
In 1970, The U.S. Census found that about 20% of American workers commuted to work by carpool.
The American Community Survey has found that the carpooling modal share has declined to around nine percent as of 2013, though it still remains the second most popular mode of travel in the U.S., next to driving alone.
On-demand ride services include ridehailing, ridesplitting, and E-hail for taxis.
They are services that provide rides on-demand, usually in passenger cars, for a fee.
These companies have faced criticism for adversely impacting traffic congestion, the environment, and public safety.
A study of ridehailing users in San Francisco in 2014 evaluated modal shifts due to ridehailing and found that, if ridehailing were unavailable, 39% of respondents would have taken a taxi and 33% would have used a form of public transit.
Four percent entered a public transit station as their origin or destination, suggesting ridehailing may serve as a first-/last-mile trip to or from public transit in some cases.
Another study of ridehailing users in Denver and Boulder, Colorado found that a third of respondents would have taken public transit, biked, or walked instead of using a ridehailing service.
Another third would have driven in a personal vehicle, and 12% would not have made the trip.
These city-specific differences suggest that travel behavior impacts due to these services could be dependent on location.
Only New York City and San Francisco have studied the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) implications of ridehailing services.
Both studies found that Uber and Lyft are increasing VMT, with the heaviest impacts seen in some of the busiest areas of each city.
However, both of these studies do not take into consideration modal shift changes.
Ridesplitting involves splitting both a ride and fare in a vehicle with others traveling in the same general direction.
These services allow dynamic matching and route variation in real time as passengers request pickups.
The user cost of ridesplitting services is lower than the cost of regular ridesourcing services, since the riders are sharing one ride and splitting the associated costs.
Yet, ridesplitting may lead to detour and inconvenience effects for the users.
Ridesplitting services are generally only available as an option in cities with denser and more established ridesourcing markets.
Ridesplitting is even less studied than ridesourcing, and therefore travel behavior impacts are not yet well understood.
E-Hail services are a mode of transportation by which taxis can be reserved via Internet or mobile phone applications maintained by either a third-party provider or the taxi company.
Examples of e-Hail services include Curb, Flywheel, Arro, Hailo, and iTaxi.
In response to competition from ridesourcing companies, e-Hail taxi services have experienced rapid growth.
As of October 2014, 80% of San Francisco taxis reported using Flywheel, an e-Hail app.
As of February 2015, Flywheel was active in six cities, and Curb was active in about 60 U.S. cities.
Since they use taxis, e-Hail services charge local taxi rates and do not use demand-based pricing during periods of higher ride demand, as ridesourcing services often do.
Microtransit is a technology-enabled private transit service that often uses shuttles or vans and is characterized by flexible scheduling, flexible routing, or both.
Current microtransit operators include Chariot (acquired by Ford in September 2016) and Via.
Defunct operators include Bridj and Leap Transit.
Two forms of microtransit have emerged, including fixed-route with fixed-schedule services and flexible-route with on-demand scheduling.
Chariot, which started in San Francisco and now operates in Austin, New York, and Seattle, functions similarly to public transit and runs 15-seater vans along pre-determined routes.
Chariot determines new routes by “crowdsourcing” potential customer demand and then launching a new route once enough demand is indicated.
Via is an example of flexible route, on-demand microtransit and currently operates in New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago.
In New York City, users request a ride using Via's app and a shared van will pick them up with other travelers heading in a similar direction.
The service is dynamic, without static routes, and shifts routes based on expected traffic and rider demand.
Via charges a fare of $5 to $7 per ride in New York City, depending on the method of booking.
Both Chariot and Via conform to the IRS “transit pass” standard, allowing them to qualify for pre-tax commuter benefits.
Microtransit services have also gained interest among some public transit operators, who see the technology as an opportunity to provide higher quality or more flexible public transit services to their users.
In some instances, like the (now defunct) RideKC:
Bridj pilot project in Kansas City, Missouri, public-private partnerships have been formed to provide microtransit services.
The RideKC:
Bridj pilot ultimately ceased operations as it failed to attract enough riders, with only nine percent of riders taking more than 10 trips.
The lack of a targeted marketing campaign, relatively high vehicle ownership rates in Kansas City, and low existing public transit mode share in the city were possible reasons for the low ridership of the pilot project.
Public-private microtransit partnerships have the potential to improve service and increase public transit ridership, but steps must be taken to appropriately evaluate demand for the service before launching.
Courier Network Services (CNS) provide delivery services of packages, food, and other items for compensation using their own transportation and are connected with shippers and customers through an online app or platform.
In P2P delivery services, someone who signs up and is approved by the platform can use their own vehicle or bicycle to conduct a delivery.
There are many business models within P2P delivery services.
Postmates couriers make deliveries using their own bicycles, scooters, or cars.
They charge a delivery fee plus a service charge of nine percent of the value of the goods being delivered.
Instacart delivers groceries for a $4 to $10 fee, depending on how long the delivery takes to complete.
The proliferation of these services, where couriers use their personally owned vehicles or bicycles, could reduce the need for delivery companies to maintain and own their own delivery fleet.
Some CNS models that have emerged also incorporate on-demand ride services (e.g., TNCs) that deliver packages.
CNS deliveries are either made in separate trips or in multiple-purpose trips that may also serve passengers simultaneously.
Sidecar and Uber have incorporated passenger, food delivery, and package delivery services.
Scootersharing is a recent application of the sharing economy within the transportation space.
Scootersharing companies took inspiration from the fourth generation bikesharing strategy, but replaced bicycles with GPS-tracked electric scooters.
These scooters are also “dockless”, and are dropped off and picked up from any location within an urban area.
Due to the lower speed of scooters and their electric assistance, it is easier for commuters to use them and for companies to invest in a fleet of them.
Many scootersharing companies have been founded in the past few years.
This includes Bird, Lime, Bolt, Skip, Scoot Networks, and Spin.
Because of its growing popularity, some cities have also looked to ban certain scootersharing companies, taking on similar strategies to ridesharing bans.
In San Francisco, the city created a Powered Scooter Share Permit Program that limits the number of companies that could operate scooters, and the amount of scooters.
Cities that enforced similar regulations cite how scooters are more commonly ridden on sidewalks instead of bike lanes and could injure pedestrians.
Other reasons would also be the lack of these companies enforcing riders to wear safety gear such as helmets.
Compared to the other forms of shared mobility, scootersharing can be more hyper-localized and can hypothetically better address the last mile problem.
Because scootersharing does not have much market adoption right now because it is a new form of transportation, there are no academic studies that can effectively measure its impact.
Overall, it provides urban mobility with fewer carbon emissions compared to automobiles.
They take up less space than bikes, so they have potential to increase transit ridership to and from bus lines.
Smartphones represent one of the most important transportation innovations of the 21st century.
A variety of factors are changing the way people think about mobility including: demographic shifts, advancements in geo-spatial routing and computing power, the use of cloud technologies, faster wireless networks capable of carrying greater bandwidth, congestion, and heightened awareness about the environment and climate change.
Mobility consumers are increasingly using smartphone applications, dubbed “apps” for an array of transportation use cases.
More people are starting their trips with smartphones to plan routes, seek departure information for the next bus or railcar, find a taxi via an e-Hail app, or source a private driver through services, such as Lyft or Uber.
Some factors driving transportation app growth are time savings; financial savings; incentives; and gamification.
Self-driving cars, in conjunction with shared mobility, have the potential to greatly increase the viability and user base of shared transportation services in the future.
There has been great interest in the idea of shared automated vehicle (SAV) services in recent years.
This interest is likely due to the highly publicized AV development space, as well as the popularity of ridesourcing services and the realization that operating cost per mile of mobility services may substantially decrease compared to current prices, with automation.
Many experts, companies, public agencies, and universities are at the initial stages of exploring the potential impacts of SAVs.
A few pilots have launched involving ridesourcing services and automated vehicles.
Uber began testing an AV service open to frequent customers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in September 2016.
Waymo (formerly Google's Self-Driving Car Project) has been testing an autonomous vehicle ride service in Arizona.
Also during September 2016 in Singapore, nuTonomy and Grab partnered to offer a similar AV ridesourcing service in a business district called “One North.”
These SAV services require an engineer to closely monitor the system at all times.
There have also been several automated shuttle service pilots around the world, although all are in the initial testing phase and operate in a low-speed setting.
Low-speed SAV shuttle companies include: EasyMile EZ10, Local Motors, Auro, and Navya SAS.
The impact that SAV services may have on travel behavior, other transportation modes, the environment, and cities in general remains uncertain.
As real-world deployment of SAVs has been extremely limited, most studies on the subject develop or modify existing models of travel behavior and include SAVs, with assumptions regarding their operations and vehicle types.
Studies predict a modal shift away from private vehicle trips due to SAVs under certain sharing scenarios.
The impact SAV services may have on VMT and congestion is uncertain as well, with some studies predicting that roadway capacity may be freed up due to more efficient operations and right-sizing of vehicles.
A skateboard is a type of sports equipment used for skateboarding.
It is usually made of a specially designed 7–8-ply maple plywood deck and has polyurethane wheels attached to the underside by a pair of skateboarding trucks.
The two main types of skateboards are the longboard and shortboard.
The shape of the board is also important: the skateboard must be concaved to perform tricks.
Skateboarding is a very individual activity, and it continues to evolve.
Since 1987, due to attention in mainstream films, media and products like skateboarding video games, children's skateboards and commercialization, skateboarding has been pulled into the mainstream.
As more interest and money has been invested into skateboarding, more skate parks, and better skateboards have become available.
In addition, the continuing interest has motivated skateboarding companies to keep innovating and inventing new things.
Skateboarding appeared for the first time in the 2020 Summer Olympics.
"Long" boards are usually over 36 inches (91 cm) long.
Plastic "penny" boards are typically about 22 inches (56 cm) long.
Some larger penny boards over 27 inches (69 cm) long are called "nickel" boards.
The longboard, a common variant of the skateboard, is used for higher speed and rough surface boarding, and they are much more expensive.
"Old school" boards (those made in the 1970s–80s or modern boards that mimic their shape) are generally wider and often have only one kicktail.
Variants of the 1970s often have little or no concavity.
The wheels allow for movement on the skateboard and helps determine the speed while riding.
There are typically four wheels on a skateboard that are attached to the trucks.
Ranging in size from around 48mm to around 60mm, smaller wheels are lighter in weight and are used for shorter distances and tricks.
The wheels are typically made of polyurethane (PU) and come in different grades of PU.
Higher-grade PU is more durable and provides a smoother ride, while lower-grade PU is more affordable but wears out faster.
Larger wheels are heavier in weight, which are better for maintaining speed and longer distances.
Wheels that are larger than 60mm are typically used for longboards.
The metal parts known as skateboard trucks are what hold a skateboard's wheels to the deck.
They are made up of a hanger that holds the axle and wheels and a baseplate that is mounted to the board.
The hanger and baseplate are joined by a kingpin, allowing the truck to swivel and turn.
Trucks for skateboards come in a variety of forms and sizes and can be modified to the rider's preferences.
The truck's height can have an impact on the board's stability and turning ability.
The truck's width should equal the width of the deck.
To manage the looseness or tightness of the trucks, the kingpin's tightness can also be changed.
This is a matter of taste and has an impact on the board's stability and ability to turn.
Each skateboard wheel is mounted on its axle via two ball bearings.
With few exceptions, the bearings are the industrial standard "608" size, with a bore of 8 or 10 mm (0.315 or 0.394 inches) depending on the axle), an outer diameter of 22 mm (0.866 inches), and a width of 7 mm (0.276 inches).
These are usually made of steel, though silicon nitride, a high-tech ceramic, is sometimes used.
Many skateboard bearings are graded according to the ABEC scale.
The starts with ABEC 1 with the least precise manufacturing tolerance, followed by 3, 5, 7, and ABEC 9 with the strictest tolerance.
Bearing performance is determined by how well maintained the bearings are.
Maintenance on bearings includes periodically cleaning and lubricating them.
Wedges can be used to change the turning characteristics of a truck.
While not part of a skateboard, an all-in-one skateboard tool capable of mounting and removing trucks & wheels and adjusting truck kingpins are commonly sold by skate shops.
Deck rails are thin, plastic strips usually screwed into the bottom section of a skateboard to decrease friction while performing slide tricks and protecting the board’s graphic from damage.
A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous car (AC), driverless car, robotaxi, robotic car or robo-car, is a car that is capable of operating with reduced or no human input.
Self-driving cars are responsible for all driving activities, such as perceiving the environment, monitoring important systems, and controlling the vehicle, which includes navigating from origin to destination.
As of early 2024, no system has achieved full autonomy (SAE Level 5).
In December 2020, Waymo was the first to offer rides in self-driving taxis to the public in limited geographic areas (SAE Level 4), and as of April 2024 offers services in Arizona (Phoenix) and California (San Francisco and Los Angeles).
In June 2024, after a Waymo self-driving taxi crashed into a utility pole in Phoenix, Arizona,  all 672 of its Jaguar I-Pace were recalled after they were found to have susceptibility to crashing into pole like items and had their software updated.
In July 2021, DeepRoute.ai started offering self-driving taxi rides in Shenzhen, China.
Starting in February 2022, Cruise offered self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, but suspended service in 2023.
In 2021, Honda was the first manufacturer to sell an SAE Level 3 car, followed by Mercedes-Benz in 2023.
Experiments have been conducted on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) since at least the 1920s.
The first ADAS system was cruise control, which was invented in 1948 by Ralph Teetor.
Trials began in the 1950s.
The first semi-autonomous car was developed in 1977, by Japan's Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory.
It required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer.
The vehicle reached speeds of 30 km/h (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail.
Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV semi-autonomous projects launched in the 1980s, funded by the United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.
By 1985, ALV had reached 31 km/h (19 mph), on two-lane roads.
Obstacle avoidance came in 1986, and day and night off-road driving by 1987.
In 1995 Navlab 5 completed the first autonomous US coast-to-coast journey.
Traveling from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 98.2% of the trip was autonomous.
It completed the trip at an average speed of 63.8 mph (102.7 km/h).
Until the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence, controls, and sensor systems.
The US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving, combining highway-embedded automation with vehicle technology, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and highway infrastructure.
The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997.
Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, Navlab drove 4,584 km (2,848 mi) across the US in 1995, 4,501 km (2,797 mi) or 98% autonomously.
In 2015, Delphi piloted a Delphi technology-based Audi, over 5,472 km (3,400 mi) through 15 states, 99% autonomously.
In 2015, Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, Michigan, and Washington DC allowed autonomous car testing on public roads.
From 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded development for connected and automated driving through Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT programs.
The Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.
In November 2017, Waymo announced testing of autonomous cars without a safety driver.
However, an employee was in the car to handle emergencies.
In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a robotaxi service, in Phoenix, Arizona.
In October 2020, Waymo launched a robotaxi service in a (geofenced) part of the area.
The cars were monitored in real-time, and remote engineers intervened to handle exceptional conditions.
In March 2019, ahead of Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record as the world's fastest autonomous car.
Robocar reached 282.42 km/h (175.49 mph).
In March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with Level 3 "Traffic Jam Pilot" driving technology, which legally allowed drivers to take their eyes off the road when the car was travelling under 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph).
In December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona.
Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.
DeepRoute.ai launched robotaxi service in Shenzhen in July 2021.
In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz received approval for a Level 3 car.
In February 2022, Cruise became the second service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in San Francisco.
In December 2022, several manufacturers scaled back plans for self-driving technology, including Ford and Volkswagen.
In 2023, Cruise suspended its robotaxi service.
Nuro was approved for Level 4 in Palo Alto in August, 2023.
As of August 2023, vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor; as of early 2024, Honda leases a Level 3 car in Japan, and Mercedes sells two Level 3 cars in Germany, California and Nevada.
Organizations such as SAE have proposed terminology standards.
However, most terms have no standard definition and are employed variously by vendors and others.
Proposals to adopt aviation automation terminology for cars have not prevailed.
Names such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot are used even though the products offer an assortment of features that may not match the names.
Despite offering a system ot called Full Self-Driving, Tesla stated that its system did not autonomously handle all driving tasks.
In the United Kingdom, a fully self-driving car is defined as a car so registered, rather than one that supports a specific feature set.
The Association of British Insurers claimed that the usage of the word autonomous in marketing was dangerous because car ads make motorists think "autonomous" and "autopilot" imply that the driver can rely on the car to control itself, even though they do not.
An ADS is an SAE J3016 level 3 or higher system.
An ADAS is a system that automates specific driving features, such as keeping the car within its lane, cruise control, and emergency braking.
An ADAS requires a human driver to handle tasks that the ADAS does not support.
Autonomy implies that an automation system is under the control of the vehicle rather than a driver.
Automation is function-specific, handling issues such as speed control, but leaves broader decision-making to the driver.
Euro NCAP defined autonomous as "the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident".
A remote driver is a driver that operates a vehicle at a distance, using a video and data connection.
According to SAE J3016, Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.
Vendors have taken a variety of approaches to the self-driving problem.
Tesla's approach is to allow their "full self-driving" (FSD) system to be used in all ODDs as a Level 2 (hands/on, eyes/on) ADAS.
Waymo picked specific ODDs (city streets in Phoenix and San Francisco) for their Level 5 robotaxi service.
Mercedes Benz offers Level 3 service in Las Vegas in highway traffic jams at speeds up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Mobileye's SuperVision system offers hands-off/eyes-on driving on all road types at speeds up to 130 kilometres per hour (81 mph).
GM's hands-free Super Cruise operates on specific roads in specific conditions, stopping or returning control to the driver when ODD changes.
In 2024 the company announced plans to expand road coverage from 400,000 miles to 750,000 miles.
Ford's BlueCruise hands-off system operates on 130,000 miles of US divided highways.
The British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines a vehicle as "driving itself" if the vehicle is "not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual".
Another British government definition stated, "Self-driving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves".
In British English, the word automated alone has several meanings, such as in the sentence: "Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as 'automated driving', preferring 'assisted driving'".
The first occurrence of the "automated" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle.
British law interprets the meaning of "automated vehicle" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle "driving itself" and an insured vehicle.
A vehicle travels “autonomously” if it is controlled by the vehicle, and neither the vehicle nor its surroundings are monitored by a person who can intervene.
Control: control of vehicle motion.
Safe: a vehicle that conforms to an acceptably safe standard.
Legal: a vehicle that offers an acceptably low risk of committing a traffic infraction.
A six-level classification system – ranging from fully manual to fully automated – was published in 2014 by SAE International as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems; the details are revised occasionally.
This classification is based on the role of the driver, rather than the vehicle's capabilities, although these are related.
After SAE updated its classification in 2016, (J3016_201609), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) adopted the SAE standard.
The classification is a topic of debate, with various revisions proposed.
SAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus.
It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not be the case.
SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure and road user behavior.
Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua and CTO Shai Shalev-Shwartz proposed an alternative taxonomy for autonomous driving systems, claiming that a more consumer-friendly approach was needed.
Its categories reflect the amount of driver engagement that is required.
Some vehicle makers have informally adopted some of the terminology involved, while not formally committing to it.
The first level, hands-on/eyes-on, implies that the driver is fully engaged in operating the vehicle, but is supervised by the system, which intervenes according to the features it supports (e.g., adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking).
The driver is entirely responsible, with hands on the wheel, and eyes on the road.
Eyes-on/hands-off allows the driver to let go of the wheel.
The system drives, the driver monitors and remains prepared to resume control as needed.
Eyes-off/hands-off means that the driver can stop monitoring the system, leaving the system in full control.
Eyes-off requires that no errors be reproducible (not triggered by exotic transitory conditions) or frequent, that speeds are contextually appropriate (e.g., 80 mph on limited-access roads), and that the system handle typical maneuvers (e.g., getting cut off by another vehicle).
The automation level could vary according to the road (e.g., eyes-off on freeways, eyes-on on side streets).
The highest level does not require a human driver in the car: monitoring is done either remotely (telepresence) or not at all.
A critical requirement for the higher two levels is that the vehicle be able to conduct a Minimum Risk Maneuver and stop safely out of traffic without driver intervention.
The perception system processes visual and audio data from outside and inside the car to create a local model of the vehicle, the road, traffic, traffic controls and other observable objects, and their relative motion.
The control system then takes actions to move the vehicle, considering the local model, road map, and driving regulations.
Several classifications have been proposed to describe ADAS technology.
One proposal is to adopt these categories: navigation, path planning, perception, and car control.
Navigation involves the use of maps to define a path between origin and destination.
Hybrid navigation is the use of multiple navigation systems.
Some systems use basic maps, relying on perception to deal with anomalies.
Such a map understands which roads lead to which others, whether a road is a freeway, a highway, are one-way, etc.
Other systems require highly detailed maps, including lane maps, obstacles, traffic controls, etc. ACs need to be able to perceive the world around them.
Supporting technologies include combinations of cameras, LiDAR, radar, audio, and ultrasound, GPS, and inertial measurement.
Deep neural networks are used to analyse inputs from these sensors to detect and identify objects and their trajectories.
Some systems use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms.
Another technique is detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), used to handle potential obstacles.
Other systems use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) technologies to aid localization.
Tesla's "vision only" system uses eight cameras, without LIDAR or radar, to create its bird's-eye view of the environment.
Path planning finds a sequence of segments that a vehicle can use to move from origin to destination.
Techniques used for path planning include graph-based search and variational-based optimization techniques.
Graph-based techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicle/obstacle.
Variational-based optimization techniques require more stringent restrictions on the vehicle's path to prevent collisions.
The large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a voronoi diagram, an occupancy grid mapping, or a driving corridor algorithm.
The latter allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open space that is bounded by lanes or barriers.
Maps are necessary for navigation.
Map sophistication varies from simple graphs that show which roads connect to each other, with details such as one-way vs two-way, to those that are highly detailed, with information about lanes, traffic controls, roadworks, and more.
Researchers at the MITComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developed a system called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive with simple maps.
The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a "sparse topological map" such as OpenStreetMap (which has only 2D road features), with sensors that observe road conditions.
One issue with highly-detailed maps is updating them as the world changes.
Vehicles that can operate with less-detailed maps do not require frequent updates or geo-fencing.
Sensors are necessary for the vehicle to properly respond to the driving environment.
Sensor types include cameras, LiDAR, ultrasound, and radar.
Control systems typically combine data from multiple sensors.
Multiple sensors can provide a more complete view of the surroundings and can be used to cross-check each other to correct errors.
For example, radar can image a scene in, e.g., a nighttime snowstorm, that defeats cameras and LiDAR, albeit at reduced precision.
After experimenting with radar and ultrasound, Tesla adopted a vision-only approach, asserting that humans drive using only vision, and that cars should be able to do the same, while citing the lower cost of cameras versus other sensor types.
By contrast, Waymo makes use of the higher resolution of LiDAR sensors and cites the declining cost of that technology.
Drive by wire is the use of electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions such as steering or speed control that are traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages.
Driver monitoring is used to assess the driver's attention and alertness.
Techniques in use include eye monitoring, and requiring the driver to maintain torque on the steering wheel.
It attempts to understand driver status and identify dangerous driving behaviors.
Vehicles can potentially benefit from communicating with others to share information about traffic, road obstacles, to receive map and software updates, etc.
ISO/TC 22 specifies in-vehicle transport information and control systems, while ISO/TC 204 specifies information, communication and control systems in surface transport.
International standards have been developed for ADAS functions, connectivity, human interaction, in-vehicle systems, management/engineering, dynamic map and positioning, privacy and security.
Rather than communicating among vehicles, they can communicate with road-based systems to receive similar information.
Software controls the vehicle, and can provide entertainment and other services.
Over-the-air updates can deliver bug fixes and additional features over the internet.
Software updates are one way to accomplish recalls that in the past required a visit to a service center.
In March 2021, the UNECE regulation on software update and software update management systems was published.
IEEE is attempting to forge a standard for safety models as "IEEE P2846: A Formal Model for Safety Considerations in Automated Vehicle Decision Making".
In 2022, a research group at National Institute of Informatics (NII, Japan) enhanced Mobileye's Reliable Safety System as "Goal-Aware RSS" to enable RSS rules to deal with complex scenarios via program logic.
The US has standardized the use of turquoise lights to inform other drivers that a vehicle is driving autonomously.
It will be used in the 2026 Mercedes-Benz EQS and S-Class sedans with Drive Pilot, an SAE Level 3 driving system.
As of 2023, the Turquoise light had not been standardized by the P.R.C or the UN-ECE.
Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in the development and operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), enabling them to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and navigate safely without human intervention.
AI algorithms empower AVs to interpret sensory data from various onboard sensors, such as cameras, LiDAR, radar, and GPS, to understand their environment and improve its technological ability and overall safety over time.
The primary obstacle to ACs is the advanced software and mapping required to make them work safely across the wide variety of conditions that drivers experience.
In addition to handling day/night driving in good and bad weather on roads of arbitrary quality, ACs must cope with other vehicles, road obstacles, poor/missing traffic controls, flawed maps, and handle endless edge cases, such as following the instructions of a police officer managing traffic at a crash site.
Other obstacles include cost, liability, consumer reluctance, ethical dilemmas, security, privacy, and legal/regulatory framework.
Further, AVs could automate the work of professional drivers, eliminating many jobs, which could slow acceptance.
Tesla calls its Level 2 ADAS "Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta".
US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate this marketing in 2021.
In December 2021 in Japan, Mercedes-Benz was punished by the Consumer Affairs Agency for misleading product descriptions.
Mercedes-Benz was criticized for a misleading US commercial advertising E-Class models.
At that time, Mercedes-Benz rejected the claims and stopped its "self-driving car" ad campaign that had been running.
In August 2022, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of deceptive marketing practices.
With the Automated Vehicles Bill (AVB) self-driving car-makers could face prison for misleading adverts in the United-Kingdom.
In the 2020s, concerns over ACs' vulnerability to cyberattacks and data theft emerged.
In 2018 and 2019 former Apple engineers were charged with stealing information related to Apple's self-driving car project.
In 2021 the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) accused Chinese security officials of coordinating a hacking campaign to steal information from government entities, including research related to autonomous vehicles.
China has prepared "the Provisions on Management of Automotive Data Security (Trial) to protect its own data".
Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything technologies are based on 5G wireless networks.
As of November 2022, the US Congress was considering the possibility that imported Chinese AC technology could facilitate espionage.
Testing of Chinese automated cars in the US has raised concern over which US data are collected by Chinese vehicles to be stored in Chinese country and concern with any link with the Chinese communist party.
ACs complicate the need for drivers to communicate with each other, e.g., to decide which car enters an intersection first.
In an AC without a driver, traditional means such as hand signals do not work (no driver, no hands).
ACs must be able to predict the behavior of possibly moving vehicles, pedestrians, etc in real time in order to proceed safely.
The task becomes more challenging the further into the future the prediction extends, requiring rapid revisions to the estimate to cope with unpredicted behavior.
One approach is to wholly recompute the position and trajectory of each object many times per second.
Another is to cache the results of an earlier prediction for use in the next one to reduce computational complexity.
The ADAS has to be able to safely accept control from and return control to the driver.
Consumers will avoid ACs unless they trust them as safe.
Robotaxis operating in San Francisco received pushback over perceived safety risks.
Automatic elevators were invented in 1900, but did not become common until operator strikes and trust was built with advertising and features such as an emergency stop button.
Autonomous also present various political and economic implications.
The transportation sector holds significant sway in many the political and economic landscapes.
For instance, many US states generates much annual revenue from transportation fees and taxes.
The advent of self-driving cars could profoundly affect the economy by potentially altering state tax revenue streams.
Furthermore, the transition to autonomous vehicles might disrupt employment patterns and labor markets, particularly in industries heavily reliant on driving professions.
Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that in 2019, the sector employed over two million individuals as tractor-trailer truck drivers.
Additionally, taxi and delivery drivers represented approximately 370,400 positions, and bus drivers constituted a workforce of over 680,000.
Collectively, this amounts to a conceivable displacement of nearly 2.9 million jobs, surpassing the job losses experienced in the 2008 Great Recession.
The prominence of certain demographic groups within the tech industry inevitably shapes the trajectory of autonomous vehicle (AV) development, potentially perpetuating existing inequalities.
Research from Georgia Tech revealed that autonomous vehicle detection systems were generally five percent less effective at recognizing darker-skinned individuals.
This accuracy gap persisted despite adjustments for environmental variables like lighting and visual obstructions.
The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics.
Adapted for ACs, it considers an AC carrying one passenger confronts a pedestrian who steps in its way.
The ADAS notionally has to choose between killing the pedestrian or swerving into a wall, killing the passenger.
Possible frameworks include deontology (formal rules) and utilitarianism (harm reduction).
One public opinion survey reported that harm reduction was preferred, except that passengers wanted the vehicle to prefer them, while pedestrians took the opposite view.
Utilitarian regulations were unpopular.
Additionally, cultural viewpoints exert substantial influence on shaping responses to these ethical quandaries.
Another study found that cultural biases impact preferences in prioritizing the rescue of certain individuals over others in car accident scenarios.
Some ACs require an internet connection to function, opening the possibility that a hacker might gain access to private information such as destinations, routes, camera recordings, media preferences, and/or behavioral patterns, although this is true of an internet-connected device.
ACs make use of road infrastructure (e.g., traffic signs, turn lanes) and may require modifications to that infrastructure to fully achieve their safety and other goals.
In March 2023, the Japanese government unveiled a plan to set up a dedicated highway lane for ACs.
In April 2023, JR East announced their challenge to raise their self-driving level of Kesennuma Line bus rapid transit (BRT) in rural area from the current Level 2 to Level 4 at 60 km/h. ACs can be tested via digital simulations, in a controlled test environment, and/or on public roads.
Road testing typically requires some form of permit or a commitment to adhere to acceptable operating principles.
For example, New York requires a test driver to be in the vehicle, prepared to override the ADAS as necessary.
In California, self-driving car manufacturers are required to submit annual reports describing how often their vehicles autonomously disengaged from autonomous mode.
This is one measure of system robustness (ideally, the system should never disengage).
In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352,545 mi (567,366 km) of testing, an average distance of 5,596 mi (9,006 km) between disengagements, the highest (best) among companies reporting such figures.
Waymo also logged more autonomous miles than other companies.
Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015.
In March 2017, Uber reported an average of 0.67 mi (1.08 km) per disengagement.
In the final three months of 2017, Cruise (owned by GM) averaged 5,224 mi (8,407 km) per disengagement over 62,689 mi (100,888 km).
Reporting companies use varying definitions of what qualifies as a disengagement, and such definitions can change over time.
Executives of self-driving car companies have criticized disengagements as a deceptive metric, because it does not consider varying road conditions.
In April 2021, WP.29 GRVA proposed a "Test Method for Automated Driving (NATM)".
In October 2021, Europe's pilot test, L3Pilot, demonstrated ADAS for cars in Hamburg, Germany, in conjunction with ITS World Congress 2021.
SAE Level 3 and 4 functions were tested on ordinary roads.
In November 2022, an International Standard ISO 34502 on "Scenario based safety evaluation framework" was published.
In April 2022, collision avoidance testing was demonstrated by Nissan.
Waymo published a document about collision avoidance testing in December 2022.
In September 2022, Biprogy released Driving Intelligence Validation Platform (DIVP) as part of Japanese national project "SIP-adus", which is interoperable with Open Simulation Interface (OSI) of ASAM.
In November 2022, Toyota demonstrated one of its GR Yaris test cars, which had been trained using professional rally drivers.
Toyota used its collaboration with Microsoft in FIA World Rally Championship since the 2017 season.
In 2023 David R. Large, senior research fellow with the Human Factors Research Group at the University of Nottingham, disguised himself as a car seat in a study to test people's reactions to driverless cars.
He said, "We wanted to explore how pedestrians would interact with a driverless car and developed this unique methodology to explore their reactions."
The study found that, in the absence of someone in the driving seat, pedestrians trust certain visual prompts more than others when deciding whether to cross the road.
As of 2023, Tesla's ADAS Autopilot/Full Self Driving (beta) was classified as Level 2 ADAS.
Another fatal Autopilot crash occurred in May in Florida in a Tesla Model S that crashed into a tractor-trailer.
In a civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla documented that the car had been on Autopilot.
According to Tesla, "neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied."
Tesla claimed that this was Tesla's first known Autopilot death in over 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) with Autopilot engaged.
Tesla claimed that on average one fatality occurs every 94 million miles (151 million kilometers) across all vehicle types in the US.
However, this number also includes motorcycle/pedestrian fatalities.
The ultimate NTSB report concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.
According to Google Waymo's accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car's software caused a crash.
On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path.
During the maneuver it struck a bus.
Google stated, "In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a collision."
Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience.
No injuries were reported.
In March 2018, Elaine Herzberg died after she was hit by an AC tested by Uber's Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) in Arizona.
A safety driver was in the car.
Herzberg was crossing the road about 400 feet from an intersection.
Some experts said a human driver could have avoided the crash.
Arizona governor Doug Ducey suspended the company's ability to test its ACs citing an "unquestionable failure" of Uber to protect public safety.
Uber also stopped testing in California until receiving a new permit in 2020.
NTSB's final report determined that the immediate cause of the accident was that safety driver Rafaela Vasquez failed to monitor the road, because she was distracted by her phone, but that Uber's "inadequate safety culture" contributed.
The report noted that the victim had "a very high level" of methamphetamine in her body.
The board called on federal regulators to carry out a review before allowing automated test vehicles to operate on public roads.
In September 2020, Vasquez pled guilty to negligent homicide.
On 12 August 2021, a 31-year-old Chinese man was killed after his NIO ES8 collided with a construction vehicle.
NIO's self-driving feature was in beta and could not deal with static obstacles.
The vehicle's manual clearly stated that the driver must take over near construction sites.
Lawyers of the deceased's family questioned NIO's private access to the vehicle, which they argued did not guarantee the integrity of the data.
In November 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) notified Pony.ai that it was suspending its testing permit following a reported collision in Fremont on 28 October.
In May 2022, DMV revoked Pony.ai's permit for failing to monitor the driving records of its safety drivers.
In April 2022, Cruise's testing vehicle was reported to have blocked a fire engine on emergency call, and sparked questions about its ability to handle unexpected circumstances.
In a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers, 49% said they would be comfortable using a "driverless car".
A 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners found 37% who initially said they would be interested in purchasing a "fully autonomous car".
However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost US$3,000 more.
In a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers, 22% had a positive attitude, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.
A 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries found 57% "stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.
In a 2014 US telephone survey, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper.
31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available.
In 2015, a survey of 5,000 people from 109 countries reported that average respondents found manual driving the most enjoyable.
22% did not want to pay more money for autonomy.
Respondents were found to be most concerned about hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety.
Finally, respondents from more developed countries were less comfortable with their vehicle sharing data.
The survey reported consumer interest in purchasing an AC, stating that 37% of surveyed current owners were either "definitely" or "probably" interested.
In 2016, a survey of 1,603 people in Germany that controlled for age, gender, and education reported that men felt less anxiety and more enthusiasm, whereas women showed the opposite.
The difference was pronounced between young men and women and decreased with age.
In a 2016 US  survey of 1,584 people, "66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver".
People were worried about safety and hacking risk.
Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees saw no advantages in this new kind of cars.
In a 2017 survey of 4,135 US adults found that many Americans anticipated significant impacts from various automation technologies including the widespread adoption of automated vehicles.
In 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published.
The questionnaire was termed the autonomous vehicle acceptance model (AVAM), including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of various automation levels.
Users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use autonomous vehicles.
Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.
In 2022, a survey reported that only a quarter (27%) of the world's population would feel safe in self-driving cars.
In 2024, a study by Saravanos et al. at New York University reported that 87% of their respondents (from a sample of 358) believed that conditionally automated cars (at Level 3) would be easy to use.
Opinion surveys may have little salience given that few respondents had any personal experience with ACs.
The regulation of autonomous cars concerns liability, approvals, and international conventions.
In the 2010s, researchers openly worried that delayed regulations could delay deployment.
In 2020, UNECE WP.29 GRVA was issued to address regulation of Level 3 automated driving.
Vehicles operating below Level 5 still offer many advantages.
As of 2023 most commercially available ADAS vehicles are SAE Level 2.
A couple of companies reached higher levels, but only in restricted (geofenced) locations.
SAE Level 2 features are available as part of the ADAS systems in many vehicles.
In the US, 50% of new cars provide driver assistance for both steering and speed.
Ford started offering BlueCruise service on certain vehicles in 2022; the system is named ActiveGlide in Lincoln vehicles.
The system provided features such as lane centering, street sign recognition, and hands-free highway driving on more than 130,000 miles of divided highways.
The 2022 1.2 version added features including hands-free lane changing, in-lane repositioning, and predictive speed assist.
In April 2023 BlueCruise was approved in the UK for use on certain motorways, starting with 2023 models of Ford's electric Mustang Mach-E SUV.
Tesla's Autopilot and its Full Self-Driving (FSD) ADAS suites are available on all Tesla cars since 2016.
FSD offers highway and street driving (without geofencing), navigation/turn management, steering, and dynamic cruise control, collision avoidance, lane-keeping/switching, emergency braking, obstacle avoidance, but still requires the driver to remain ready to control the vehicle at any moment.
Its driver management system combines eye tracking with monitoring pressure on the steering wheel to ensure that drives are both eyes on and hands on.
Tesla's FSD rewrite V12 (released in March 2024) uses a single deep learning transformer model for all aspects of perception, monitoring, and control.
It relies on its eight cameras for its vision-only perception system, without use of LiDAR, radar, or ultrasound.
As of April 2024, FSD has been deployed on two million Tesla cars.
As of January 2024, Tesla has not initiated requests for Level 3 status for its systems and has not disclosed its reason for not doing so.
General Motors is developing the "Ultra Cruise" ADAS system, that will be a dramatic improvement over their current "Super Cruise" system.
Ultra Cruise will cover "95 percent" of driving scenarios on 2 million miles of roads in the US, according to the company.
The system hardware in and around the car includes multiple cameras, short- and long-range radar, and a LiDAR sensor, and will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride Platform.
The luxury Cadillac Celestiq electric vehicle will be one of the first vehicles to feature Ultra Cruise.
Europe is developing a new "Driver Control Assistance Systems" (DCAS) level 2 regulation to no longer limit the use of lane changing systems to roads with 2 lanes and a physical separation from traffic in the opposite direction.
As of April 2024, two car manufacturers have sold or leased Level 3 cars: Honda in Japan, and Mercedes in Germany, Nevada and California.
Mercedes Drive Pilot has been available on the EQS and S-class sedan in Germany since 2022, and in California and Nevada since 2023.
A subscription costs between €5,000 and €7,000 for three years in Germany and $2,500 for one year in the United States.
Drive Pilot can only be used when the vehicle is traveling under 40 miles per hour (64 km/h), there is a vehicle in front, readable line markings, during the day, clear weather, and on freeways mapped by Mercedes down to the centimeter (100,000 miles in California).
As of April 2024, one Mercedes vehicle with this capability has been sold in California.

In January 2023, Holon announced an autonomous shuttle during the 2023 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).
The company claimed the vehicle is the world's first Level 4 shuttle built to automotive standard.
A sliding door is a type of door that is mounted on or suspended from a track for the door to slide, usually horizontally and outside.
It is a feature predominantly found in minibuses, buses, and vans, so as to allow a large unobstructed access to the interior for loading and unloading of passengers or cargo without the doors interfering with adjacent space.
Sliding doors are often used on the outside of mini MPVs, such as the Toyota Porte, Peugeot 1007 and Renault Kangoo, but are more commonly used in full-sized MPVs like the Toyota Previa, the Citroën C8, the Peugeot 807, the Chrysler Voyager and the Kia Carnival.
Their use has increased over the years as MPVs have increased in popularity, because it gives easy access and makes parking in tight spaces possible.
The most common type of sliding door, that has a three-point suspension and opens outwards, then runs along the side of the vehicle, was introduced in 1964 by Volkswagen AG as an option on its Type 2 vans.
A pocket door is a sliding door that slides along its width and disappears, when open, into a compartment in the adjacent wall, or as in terms of vehicles, into the vehicle's bodywork.
Pocket doors are used in some delivery vans, as well as, for example, the Renault Estafette and Morris J4, and train carriages, such as the London Underground 1973 Stock, but rarely in cars.
Montreal Metro MR-63 and MR-73 wagons have two panel pocket doors.
The 1954 Kaiser Darrin had a unique setup pocket doors that would slide into the front fender.
Because of this the doors had no side windows installed on them.
Sliding plug doors on a bus have pantographic hinges that move the door panel outwards from its plug socket and then parallel to the side of the bus to clear the opening.
On closing, the door is wedged and locked into the opening.
This arrangement makes a very good airtight and soundproof seal and is commonly found on coaches.
Many passenger train cars use plug doors.
On commuter and regional trains doors of plug design take less room than sliding doors, but may restrict the compatibility of a car with high passenger platforms since these doors open outwards.
High-speed trains use sliding plug doors because they can be made airtight, soundproof and reduce aerodynamic drag.
Opens normally like a traditional van sliding door, but unlike most sliding doors where the track is on the exterior of the vehicle, this type has it inside and on the side of the door itself.
This allows the exterior to remain clean in design and yet the door can slide outside past the trailing edge of the car.
This design is very uncommon; it has only been used on Mitsubishi vehicles, and was invented by Mitsubishi Motors.
The first vehicle to use it was the Mitsubishi RVR Space Runner; it was designed because the RVR is a short car compared to the size of the siding door, making it incapable of having a track on the exterior of the car.
Thus, the inner-track mechanism was used so the sliding door can slide open wide enough to let passengers enter and exit the car easily.
The new Mitsubishi EK Wagon/Nissan Otti also uses this type of sliding door, but has it only on one side while the driver's side door of the back seats is a normal hinge door.
The sliding door of the EK wagon is also electric-powered.
A vertical door is a type of sliding door that slides vertically, usually on a rail or track.
The BMW Z1's doors slide vertically down into the car's chassis.
This means that they slide into a compartment within the car's body and so are also technically pocket doors, but they are not classified as such because they do not slide along their length into an adjacent compartment.
The inspiration for these doors came from traditional roadsters which often feature removable metal or cloth doors.
Because removable doors did not fit within BMW's design goals, the vertical-sliding doors were installed instead.
Because the doors slide vertically downwards into the body, the top halves of the sides of the car slide into the bottom half.
The high sills can make entry and exit harder, although they do offer crash protection independent of the doors; therefore, the vehicle may be legally and safely driven with the doors up or down.
The windows can be operated independently of the doors, although they will automatically retract if the door is lowered.
The Lincoln Mark VIII concept car's doors slide into the frame underbody and disappear from view.
By doing this, it solved the problem of a high door sill that the Z1 experienced.
However, this design is much more complicated, so the risk of failure is increased.
Also, all of the mechanisms to make the doors work add a significant amount of weight to the car, slowing it down, and making it less efficient.
This was designed because Lincoln executives were concerned about the large, heavy doors on the Mark VIII and wanted to improve them, especially for cities with tight parking spaces.
They had the idea of a Mark VIII that had doors that disappeared beneath the car and would require no additional space outside the car's wheelbase for the doors to open in order to allow people to enter or exit.
At this time it was usual for the large car manufacturers to sub-contract their concepts to other companies who specialized in design and construction based on a concept.
In this case, this Mark VIII was sent to Joalto near Detroit.
Joalto still holds many United States patents for with this vehicle's chassis and body construction.
Joalto Design Inc. built this one-of-a-kind concept car and shipped it to Lincoln for executive approval for production.
The executives disliked the design and ordered the prototype destroyed.
Instead, the vehicle was sold on eBay in September 2007.
Slugging, also known as casual carpooling, is the practice of forming ad hoc, informal carpools for purposes of commuting, essentially a variation of ride-share commuting and hitchhiking.
A driver picks up these non-paying passengers (known as "slugs" or "sluggers") at key locations, as having these additional passengers means that the driver can qualify to use an HOV lane or enjoy toll reduction.
While the practice is most common and most publicized in the congested Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, slugging also occurs in San Francisco, Houston, and other cities.
In order to relieve traffic volume during the morning and evening rush hours, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes that require more than one person per automobile were introduced in many major American cities to encourage carpooling and greater use of public transport, first appearing in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area in 1975.
The failure of the new lanes to relieve congestion, and frustration over failures of public-transport systems and high fuel prices, led to the creation in the 1970s of "slugging", a form of hitchhiking between strangers that is beneficial to both parties, as drivers and passengers are able to use the HOV lane for a quicker trip.
While passengers are able to travel for free, or cheaper than via other modes of travel, and HOV drivers sometimes pay no tolls, "slugs are, above all, motivated by time saved, not money pocketed".
Concern for the environment is not their primary motivation.
In the Washington area—with the second-busiest traffic during rush hour in the United States and Canada as of 2010—slugging occurs on Interstates 95, 66 and 395 between Washington and Northern Virginia.
As of 2006, there were about 6,459 daily slugging participants there.
In the San Francisco Bay Area, with the third-busiest rush hour, casual carpooling occurs on Interstate 80 between the East Bay and San Francisco.
As of 1998, 8,000 to 9,000 people slugged in San Francisco daily.
However, after bridge tolls were levied on carpool vehicles in 2010, casual carpooling saw a significant decline and etiquette became more uncertain.
Among the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area was the end of casual carpooling in March 2020.
As of November 2022 the tradition has not materially resumed; although drivers continue to hope to see waiting passengers at designated pickup spots, the spontaneous nature of the program means that there is no one to officially restart it, although several smartphone apps have been developed.
Slugging also occurs in tenth-busiest Houston, at a rate of 900 daily in 2007, and in Pittsburgh.
Slugging is shown to be effective in reducing vehicle travel distance as a form of ridesharing.
Slugging is more used during morning commutes than evening commutes.
The most common mode that slugging replaces is the transit bus.
David D. Friedman's The Machinery of Freedom proposed a similar system (which he referred to as "jitney transit") in the 1970s.
However, his plan assumed that passengers would be expected to pay for their transit, and that security measures such as electronic identification cards (recording the identity of both driver and passenger in a database readily available to police, in the event one or both parties disappeared) would be needed in order for people to feel safe.
Although slugging is informal, ad hoc, and free, in 30 years no violence or crime was reported from Washington D.C. slugging until October 2010, when former Sergeant Major of the Army Gene McKinney struck one of his passengers with his car after they threatened to report his reckless driving to the police.
The term slug (used as both a noun and a verb) came from bus drivers who had to determine if the people waiting at the stop were genuine bus passengers or merely people wanting a free lift, in the same way that they look out for fake coins—or "slugs"—being thrown into the fare-collection box.
In practice, slugging involves the creation of free, unofficial ad hoc carpool networks, often with published routes and pick-up and drop-off locations.
In the morning, sluggers gather at local businesses and at government-run locations such as park and ride-like facilities or bus stops and subway stations with lines of sluggers.
Drivers pull up to the queue for the route they will follow and either display a sign or call out the designated drop-off point they are willing to drive to and how many passengers they can take; in the Washington area the Pentagon—the largest place of employment in the United States, with 25,000 workers—is a popular destination.
Enough riders fill the car and the driver departs.
In the evening, the routes reverse.
The slug first in line gets the next ride to their destination and also gets to choose the front or back seat.
Slugs should never take a ride out of turn.
Drivers are not to pick up sluggers en route to or standing outside the line, a practice referred to as "body snatching".
A woman is not to be left in the line alone, for her safety.
No eating, smoking, or putting on of makeup is allowed.
The driver has full control of the radio and climate controls.
Windows may not be opened unless the driver approves.
No money is exchanged or requested, as the driver and slugs all benefit from slugging.
Driver and passengers say "Thank you" at the end.
While local governments sometimes aid sluggers by posting signs labeled with popular destinations for people to queue at, slugging is organized by its participants and no slug line has ever been created by government.
Slug lines are organized and maintained by volunteers.
Government officials have become more aware of sluggers' needs when planning changes that affect their behavior, and solicit their suggestions.
The Virginia Department of Transportation even includes links on their governmental webpage regarding slugging.
In France, spontaneous carpool lines have been established in rural municipalities by Ecov using electronic signs and smartphone apps to alert drivers of waiting riders.
In Jakarta, "car jockeys" had been paid by commuters to ride into the center of the city to permit the use of high-occupancy vehicle lanes until the lanes were eliminated in 2017.
In India, it is illegal for drivers to randomly pick up commuters from the public roads and there is evidence that such drivers have been fined.
In the Polish People's Republic, hitchhiking was officially supported by the government (and formalized), and in Cuba, government vehicles are obligated to take hitchhikers, but these systems have nothing to do with high-occupancy lanes.
A share taxi (also called shared taxi or taxibus) is a mode of transport which falls between a taxicab and a bus.
These vehicles for hire are typically smaller than buses and usually take passengers on a fixed or semi-fixed route without timetables, but instead departing when all seats are filled.
They may stop anywhere to pick up or drop off their passengers.
Often found in developing countries, the vehicles used as share taxis range from four-seat cars to minibuses.
They are often owner-operated.
In some terms share taxis can also be referred to as taxibuses since they play a role of taxis where the destination is selected by the rider as opposed to routed buses which travel on a route that is assigned by the transit operator.
A given share taxi route may start and finish in fixed central locations, and landmarks may serve as route names or route termini.
In some African cities routes are run between formal termini, where the majority of passengers board.
In these places the share taxis wait for a full load of passengers prior to departing, and off-peak wait times may be in excess of an hour.
In other places there may be no formal termini, with taxis simply congregating at a central location, instead.
Even more-formal terminals may be a little more than parking lots.
In South Africa, the term "rank" denotes an area, specifically built for taxi operators by a municipality or city, where commuters may start and end their journey.
Where they exist, shared taxis provide service on set routes within and sometimes between towns.
After a shared taxi has picked up passengers at its terminus, it proceeds along a semi-fixed route where the driver may determine the actual route within an area according to traffic conditions.
Drivers will stop anywhere to allow riders to disembark, and may sometimes do the same when prospective passengers want to ride.
While all share taxis share certain characteristics—and many regional versions exhibit peculiarities—some basic operational distinctions can be delineated.
Most share taxis are operated under one of two regimes.
Some share taxis are operated by a company.
For example, in Dakar there are company-owned fleets of hundreds of car rapides.
In the Soviet Union, share taxis, known as marshrutka, were operated by state-owned taxi parks.
There are also individual operators in many countries.
In Africa, while there are company share taxis, individual owners are more common.
Rarely owning more than two vehicles at a time, they will rent out a minibus to operators, who pay fuel and other running costs, and keep revenue.
In some places, like some African cities and also Hong Kong, share taxi minibuses are overseen by syndicates, unions, or route associations.
These groups often function in the absence of a regulatory environment and may collect dues or fees from drivers (such as per-use terminal payments, sometimes illegally), set routes, manage terminals, and fix fares.
Terminal management may include ensuring each vehicle leaves with a full load of passengers.
Because the syndicates represent owners, their regulatory efforts tend to favor operators rather than passengers, and the very termini syndicates upkeep can cost delays and money for passengers as well as forcing them to disembark at inconvenient locations, in a phenomenon called "terminal constraint".
In Africa, regulation is mainly something that pertains to the vehicle itself not its operator or its mode of operation.
In Kenya, regulation does extend to operators and mode of operation (such as routes used) as well as the vehicle.
As of 2008, African minibuses are difficult to tax, and may operate in a "regulatory vacuum" perhaps because their existence is not part of a government scheme, but is simply a market response to a growing demand for such services.
Route syndicates and operator's associations often exercise unrestricted control, and existing rules may see little enforcement.
Share taxi is a unique mode of transport independent of vehicle type.
Minibuses, midibuses, covered pickup trucks, station wagons, and lorries see use as share taxis.
Certain vehicle types may be better-suited to current condition than others.
In many traffic-choked, sprawling, and low-density African cities minibuses profit.
In Israel they were mostly the largest model of Mercedes, owned generally by Arabs, and very efficient, having space for 7–8 people, and having loosely fixed routes, dropping a passenger either at a specific terminus or going a little out of the way to facilitate the passenger.
While carrying different names and distinguished by regional peculiarities, the share taxi is an everyday feature of life in many places throughout the world.
Some Francophone African countries use the term taxi-brousse ('bush taxi', often spelled with a space rather than a hyphen in English) for share taxis.
In Algeria, taxis collectifs ply fixed routes with their destination displayed.
Rides are shared with others who are picked up along the way, and the taxi will leave only when it seats all the passengers it can.
While stations, set locations to board and disembark, exist, prospective passengers flag down a taxi collectif when they want a ride.
Operating inter- and intra-city, taxis collectifs that travel between towns may be called interwilaya taxis.
Along with all forms of public transport in Algeria, the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada recommend against using these share taxis.
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs asks that you use taxis recommended by a hotel.
In Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, the share taxi or taxi brousse role is not filled by the traditional African minibus.
Those in Kinshasa, DRC, (or perhaps just the Kongo people) may call share taxis fula fula meaning "quick quick".
There was no independent transport authority in the city of Kinshasa as of 2008.
Share taxis do exist in Cameroon, but as of 2008 minibuses cannot be used for this purpose, by law.
That same year, Douala, Cameroon, also was without an independent transport authority.
Egyptian share cabs are generally known as micro-bus (mekrobass ميكروباص or mašrūʿ مشروع, "project"; plural mekrobassāt ميكروباصات or mašarīʿ مشاريع).
The second name is used by Alexandrians.
Micro-buses are licensed by each governorate as taxicabs, and are generally operated privately by their drivers.
Although each governorate attempts to maintain a consistent paint scheme for them, in practice the color of them varies wildly, as the "consistent" schemes have changed from time to time and many drivers have not bothered to repaint their cars.
Rates vary depending on distance traveled, although these rates are generally well known to those riding the micro-bus.
The fares also depend on the city.
Riders can typically hail micro-buses from any point along the route, often with well-established hand signals indicating the prospective rider's destination, although certain areas tend to be well-known micro-bus stops.
Like the Eastern European marshrutka, a typical micro-bus is a large van, most often a Toyota HiAce or its Jinbei equivalent, the Haise, and the latter is produced by the Bavarian Auto Manufacturing Group in 6th of October City in Egypt.
Smaller vans and larger small buses are also used.
Minibus taxis in Ethiopia are one of the most important modes of transport in big cities like Addis Ababa.
They are preferred by the majority of the populace over public buses and more traditional taxicabs because they are generally cheap, operate on diverse routes, and are available in abundance.
All minibus taxis in Ethiopia have a standard blue-and-white coloring scheme, much as New York taxis are yellow.
Minibus taxis are usually Toyota HiAces, frequent the streets.
They typically can carry 11 passengers, but will always have room for another until that is no longer the case.
The minibus driver has a crew member called a weyala whose job is to collect the fare from passengers.
In 2008, publicly operated public transport was available in Addis Ababa in addition to that provided by the minibuses.
A fleet of 350 large buses may operate for this purpose, as such a number does exist.
Also as of 2008, the city lacks an independent transport authority, but some regulation, such as that controlling market entry, does exist.
Route syndicates may be present but are described as "various".
In Ghana and neighboring countries, tro tro are privately owned minibus vehicles for hire that travel fixed routes leaving when filled to capacity.
While there are tro tro stations, these shared taxis can also be boarded anywhere along the route.
Operated by a driver and a conductor, who collects money, shouts out the destination, and is called a "mate", many are decorated with slogans and sayings, often religious, and few operate on Sundays.
Tro tro are used by 70% of Ghanaian commuters.
This popularity may be because in cities such as Accra had only basic public transportation save for these small minibuses.
Following the creation of the Greater Accra Passenger Transport Executive, some large buses were brought into service, mainly Brazilian-built Scanias with Marcopolo bodies.
A Bus Rapid Transit system is being developed for opening in November 2019.
The Swedish company Scania has won the contract to not only supply the buses but also the infrastructure.
An informal means of transportation, in Ghana they are licensed by the government, but the industry is self-regulated.
In Accra, syndicates include GPRTU and PROTOA.
In the Ivory Coast, gbaka is a name for minibus public transports.
The transport regulator in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is Agence de Gestion des Transports Urbains or AGETU.
As of 2008, Abidjan public transport was serviced by large buses as well as minibusses.
Syndicates include UPETCA and SNTMVCI.
In Mali, at least two words for share taxi may have common currency sotrama and dourouni.
As of 2008, Bamako, Mali, has no independent transport authority, but share taxi activity could fall under regulator Direction de la régulation et du contrôle du transport urbain (municipal) or DRCTU control.
In Morocco, grands taxis are the name for large, unmetered, shared taxicabs used for transportation between towns.
Grands taxis are generally old full-size Mercedes-Benz sedans, and seat six or more passengers.
In Nigeria, both minibusses (called danfo) and midibuses (molue) may be operated as share taxis.
Such forms of public transport may also be referred to as bolekaja, and many bear slogans or sayings.
Area Transport Agency (LAMATA), its remit most probably includes share taxi activity.
Outside of Lagos, most major cities in Africa have similar systems of transport.
Syndicates in Lagos may include the National Union of Road and Transport Workers (NURTW).
Minibus public transports in Rwanda may be called coaster buses, share taxis, or twegerane.
The latter could easily be a word meaning "stuffed" or "full".
As of 2020 in Kigali, Rwanda, syndicates include RFTC, Kigali Bus Services, and Royal Express, all of these operating in Kigali but each province has got a couple of companies operating there as well.
Over 60% of South African commuters use shared minibus taxis (16 seater commuter buses), sometimes referred to as kombis.
Many of these vehicles are unsafe and not roadworthy, and often dangerously overloaded.
Prior to 1987, the taxi industry in South Africa was highly regulated and controlled.
Black taxi operators were declined permits in the Apartheid era and all minibus taxi operations were, by their very nature, illegal.
Post-1987, the industry was rapidly deregulated, leading to an influx of new minibus taxi operators, keen to make money off the high demand for this service.
Taxi operators banded together to form local and national associations.
Because the industry was largely unregulated and the official regulating bodies corrupt, these associations soon engaged in anti-competitive price fixing and exhibited gangster tactics – including the hiring of hit-men and all-out gang warfare.
During the height of the conflict, it was not uncommon for taxi drivers to carry shotguns and AK-47s to simply shoot rival taxi drivers and their passengers on sight.
Currently the South African Government is attempting to formalize and re-regulate the out-of-control minibus taxi industry.
Along with new legislation, the government has instituted a 7-year recapitalization scheme to replace the old and un-roadworthy vehicles with new 18- and 35-seater minibusses.
These new minibus taxis carry the South African flag on the side and are notably more spacious and safe.
Minivans (minibuses may be a more correct term here) are used as vehicles for hire and referred to as dala dala in Tanzania.
While dala dala may run fixed routes picking up passengers at central locations, they will also stop along the route to drop someone off or allow a prospective passenger to board.
Before minibuses became widely used, the typical dala dala was a pick-up truck with benches placed in the truck bed.
In Dar es Salaam, publicly operated minibus service may also exist as of 2008.
Usually run by both a driver and a conductor, the latter is called a mpigadebe, literally meaning "a person who hits a debe" (a 4-gallon tin container used for transporting gasoline or water).
The name is in reference to the fact that conductors often hit the roof and side of the van to attract customers and to notify the driver when to leave the station.
These often-crowded public transports have their routes allocated by a Tanzania transport regulator, Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), but syndicates also exist and include DARCOBOA.
Share taxis in Tunisia are called louage and follow fixed or semi-fixed routes, departing from stations when full.
Usually minibuses or compact cars, although some louage are station wagons, passengers may board and disembark at any point during travel.
They run between towns and within cities.
The term kia kia may be used in Yorùbáland to refer to minibus public transports, and means "quick quick".
Public light buses (Chinese: 公共小型巴士), also known as minibus or maxicab (Chinese: 小巴), run the length and breadth of Hong Kong, through areas which the standard bus lines cannot or do not reach as frequently, quickly or directly.
Typically offering a faster and more efficient transportation solution due to their small size, limited carrying capacity, frequency, and diverse range of routes, although they are generally slightly more expensive than standard buses, minibusses carry a maximum of 19 seated passengers.
Standing passengers are not allowed.
There are two types of public light minibus, green and red.
Both types have a cream-coloured body, the distinguishing feature being the colour of the external roof, and the type of service that the colour denotes: green is like regular transit bus with fixed number, route, schedule and fare (but generally not fixed stops); red is a shared taxi, operating on semi-fixed route unregulated, with the driver waiting for enough passengers to justify leaving, as his income depends on the revenue.
In Cyprus, there are privately owned share taxis that travel to set destinations and board additional passengers en route called service taxis.
Shared taxis have been operating in Mumbai, India, since the early 1970s.
These are point-to-point services that operate during peak hours.
During off-peak hours they ply like regular taxis; they can be hailed anywhere on the roads and passengers are charged by the meter.
During peak hours they will take a full cab load of passengers to a more or less common destination.
The pick-up points are usually fixed, and sometimes (but not always) marked by a sign saying "shared taxis".
Cabs typically line up at this point during peak hours.
They sometimes display their general destination on their windscreens, and passengers get in and wait for the cab to fill up.
Once full the cab moves off.
Fares are fixed and much lower than the metered fare to the same destination, but higher than a bus or train fare.
Such informal arrangements also exist in other Indian cities.
Share jeeps are a common form of transportation in the Himalayas, the North Eastern States, and elsewhere.
Angkutan Kota (lit. 'city transport'), abbreviated as angkot, are share taxis in Indonesia widely operating throughout the country usually with microbuses.
In some places there were also three-wheelers which are called bemo (such as autorickshaws based on the Daihatsu Midget) but phased out.
The older version of Angkot is called oplet.
The name of this transportation differs from each different province or area in the country.
In Jakarta, it is called angkot or "mikrotrans", in other parts such as in Sulawesi, the term mikrolet (shortened "mikro") is more widely used especially in Manado.
In Makassar it is called "pete-pete", in Malang it is called "angkota", in Medan it is called "sudako", in Aceh it is called "labi-labi".
Share taxis operated across rural/village routes are called angkutan desa (lit. 
'village transport'), abbreviated as angkudes.
Angkot and angkudes run accordingly to their exact routes and may stop at any class of bus stations (A, B, and C-Type bus stations).
Additionally, passengers can stop the van anywhere according to its destination, and is not required to stop at a bus stop.
In Iran, a share taxi is usually called "taxi", while a non-share is called "ajans"/اژانس, pronounced [aʒans].
Four passengers share a taxi and sometimes there is no terminus and they wait in the street side and blare their destination to all taxis until one of them stops.
These are regular taxis but if somebody wants to get a non-share taxi he can call for an ajans (taxi service) for himself or wait in the street side and say "Darbast" (which means non-share).
It means he is not interested in sharing the taxi and is consequently willing to pay more for the privilege.
Minibuses, in the past years, with a capacity of 18 passengers, and nowadays van taxis, with a capacity of 10 passengers are other kinds of share transport in Iran.
In Hebrew: מונית שירות monit sherut, pl.
Hebrew: מוניות שירות moniyot sherut is a word meaning "service taxi".
Referring to vans or minibuses that serve as share taxis in Israel, these can be picked up from anywhere on their route.
They follow fixed routes (sometimes the same routes as public transport buses) and usually leave from the initial station only when full.
Moniyot sherut operate both inter- and intra-city.
Payment is often done by passing money to the driver in a "human chain" formed by the passengers seated before.
The change (and the receipt, when requested) are returned to the person who paid by the same means.
In intra-city routes, where they compete with official buses, the drivers usually coordinate their travel by radio so that they can arrive at the bus station just before public transport buses and take the most passengers.
Monit sherut is one of the only forms of transit accessible to many Israelis during Shabbat, as most public transportation in the country closes down between sunset on Friday and sunset on Saturday.
The most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines as of 2007, jeepneys were originally made out of US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known for their color and flamboyant decoration.
Today the jeepneys are built by local body shops from a combination of prefabricated elements (from a handful of Filipino manufacturers) and improvisation and in most cases equipped with "surplus" or used Japanese SUV or light truck engines, drive train, suspension and steering components (from recycled vehicles in Japan).
They have not changed much since their post-war creation, even in the face of increased access to pre-made vehicles, such as minibuses.
However, due to the government's Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program, Jeepneys and other modes of transportation must comply to the newer Philippine National Standards which is more compliant with international standards.
Older jeepneys have the entrance on the back, and there is space for two people beside the driver (or more if they are small) while the modern jeepneys have two doors on the right side of the vehicle.
The back cab of the Jeepney is equipped with two long bench seats along the sides and the people seated closest to the driver are responsible for passing the fare of new passengers forward to the driver and the change back to the passenger.
The start and end point of the jeepney route is often a jeepney terminal, where there is a queue system so only one jeepney plying a particular route is filled at a time, and where a person helps the driver to collect fares and fill the vehicles with people, usually to more than comfortable capacity.
Preferring to leave only when full and only stop for a crowd of potential passengers, riders can nonetheless disembark at any time; and while jeepneys ply fixed routes, these may be subject to change over time.
New ones may need approval from a Philippine transport regulator.
Jeepney stations do exist.
Another share taxi that is also common in the Philippines is the UV Express which uses Compact MPVs and vans as its form factor.
These vehicles seat 10–18 people and charge an additional 2 Philippine peso per kilometer (as of 2013).
Literally "two rows" a songthaew or song thaew (Thai สองแถว, Lao: ສອງແຖວ [sɔ̌ːŋtʰíw]) is a passenger vehicle in Thailand and Laos adapted from a pick-up or a larger truck and used as a share taxi.
They are also known as baht buses.
In Turkey and Northern Cyprus, dolmuş (pronounced "dolmush") are share taxis that run on set routes within and between cities.
Each of these cars or minibuses displays their particular route on signboards behind the windscreen.
Some cities may only allow dolmuş to pick up and disembark passengers at designated stops, and terminals also exist.
The word derives from Turkish for "full" or "stuffed", as these share taxis depart from the terminal only when a sufficient number of passengers have boarded.
Visitors to Turkey have been surprised by the speed of dolmuş travel.
These share taxis are also found in Turkish-controlled, Northern Cyprus under the same name.
Traveling intra and inter-city, the privately owned minibuses or aging Mercedes stretch limos are overseen by a governance institution; routes are leased and vehicles licensed.
Passengers board anywhere along the route (you may have to get the driver to stop if he doesn't honk at you) as well as at termini and official stations.
Dolmuş in Turkish-controlled, Northern Cyprus display their routes but don't follow timetables.
Instead, they simply appear frequently.
Share taxis are often called "ser-vees" (service taxi) in the West Bank.
Minibuses are often used in lieu of vans.
Ford Transit vans were often a popular vehicle for conversion, resulting in the generic trademark "Ford" and "Fordat"(pl) being used to describe minibusses of various makes, replacing aging Mercedes sedans.
Shared taxis in New Zealand nowadays are referred to as shuttles or shuttle vans.
Shared buses or vans are available in many more developed countries connecting frequent destinations, charging a fixed fee per passenger.
The most common case is a connection between an airport and central city locations.
These services are often known as shuttles.
Such services usually use smaller vehicles than normal buses and often operate on demand.
An air traveler can contact the shuttle company by telephone or Internet, not necessarily in advance; the company will ensure that a shuttle is provided without unreasonable delay.
The shuttle will typically connect one airport with several large hotels, or addresses in a specified area of the city.
The shuttle offers much of the convenience of a taxi, although it takes longer, at a price that is significantly lower for one or two passengers.
Scheduled services between an airport and a hotel, usually operated by the hotel, are also called shuttles.
In many cases the shuttle operator takes the risk of there not being enough passengers to make the trip profitable; in others, there is a minimum charge when there are not enough passengers.
Usually, there are regulations covering vehicles and drivers; for example in New Zealand under NZTA regulations, shuttles are only allowed to have up to eleven passenger seats, and the driver must have a passenger endorsement (P) on their driver's license.
Share taxis in Estonia are mostly found in Tallinn, the capital.
Called liinitakso, marsruuttakso, taksobuss or mikroautobuss depending on the language spoken, these minibusses run fixed routes and allow passengers to disembark at any time.
In Athens, Greece most taxis were share taxis, but since the country joined the EU this tradition started to disappear.
In Lithuania, share taxis are called maršrutinis taksi.
Besides the conventional deeltaxi, there are treintaxis in some Dutch towns.
Operated on behalf of the Netherlands Railways, they run to and from railway stations and the ride is shared with additional passengers picked up along the way.
Tickets can be purchased at railway ticket offices or from the cabdriver, but treintaxis must be ordered by phone unless boarding at a railway station.
In 2018 Arriva launched shared taxi service Arriva Click in Liverpool and Sittingbourne and Kent Science Park in the United Kingdom.
In some towns in Northern Ireland, notably certain districts in Ballymena, Belfast, Derry and Newry, share taxi services operate using Hackney carriages and are called black taxis.
These services developed during The Troubles as public bus services were often interrupted due to street rioting.
Taxi collectives are closely linked with political groups – those operating in Catholic areas with Sinn Féin, those in Protestant areas with loyalist paramilitaries and their political wings.
Typically, fares approximate those of Translink operated bus services on the same route.
Service frequencies are typically higher than on-bus services, especially at peak times, although limited capacities mean that passengers living close to the termini may find it difficult to find a black taxi with seats available in the rush hour.
Major providers of mobility services such as MOD Mobility On Demand and/or Collective Taxi in Switzerland are Telebus Kriens LU, Taxito, myBuxi, Kollibri by Swiss Postal Bus, and Pikmi by VBZ Verkehrsbetriebe Zurich ZH.
Most providers as TNC Transportation Network Companies run single-source mobility platforms for the service and/or are connected with multi-modal mobility platforms of Public Transit (= Collective Traffic) and city administration/community organizations.
Most areas of Barbados are served by ZRs, which run in addition to the government-run bus service.
In the Dominican Republic, these privately owned vehicles run fixed routes with no designated stops, and the ride is shared with other passengers.
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada advises against traveling in the Dominican Republic carros públicos because doing so makes passengers targets for robbery, and because the taxis are known to, "disregard traffic laws, often resulting in serious accidents involving injuries and sometimes death."
The US Department of State also warns that using them is hazardous, as passengers often have their pockets picked, and are sometimes robbed by the drivers themselves.
Tap taps, gaily painted buses or pick-up trucks, and publiques, usually older saloon cars, serve as share taxis in Haiti.
Tap taps are privately owned and beautifully decorated.
They follow fixed routes; won't leave until filled with passengers; and many feature wild colors, portraits of famous people, and intricate, hand-cut wooden window covers.
Often they are painted with religious names or slogans.
Riders can disembark at any point in the journey.
Their name refers to "fast motion".
The publiques operate on fixed routes and pick up additional passengers all along the way.
In Saint Lucia, waychehs are a name for minibus public transports using Toyota HiAce.
In Quebec, share taxis or jitneys are called taxis collectifs (in English "shared taxis") or transport collectif par taxi (which the STM translates in English as "taxibus") and are operated by subcontractors to the local transit authorities on fixed routes.
Google translate renders "transport collectif par taxi" as "public transport by taxi".
In the case of the Montréal the fare is the same as the local bus fare, but no cash and transfers are issued or accepted; in case of the STL only bus passes.
The Réseau de transport de Longueuil accepts regular RTL tickets and all RTL and some Réseau de transport métropolitain TRAM passes.
In Guatemala, ruleteros, minibus share taxis, pick up and discharge passengers along major streets.
Jitney is an American English term that originally referred to a vehicle for hire intermediate between a taxi and a bus.
It is generally a small-capacity vehicle that follows a rough service route, but it can go slightly out of its way to pick up and drop off passengers.
In many US cities (e.g. Pittsburgh and Detroit), the term jitney refers to an unlicensed taxi cab.
The name comes from an archaic, colloquial term for a five-cent piece in the US (the nickel).
The common fare for the service when it first came into use was five cents, so the "five-cent cab" or "jitney cab" came to be known for the price charged.
In Rhode Island, a jitney license plate is used for all public passenger buses, even for larger ones.
While jitneys became fairly common in many other countries, such as the Philippines, they first appeared in the United States and Canada.
The first US jitneys ran in 1914 in Los Angeles, California.
By 1915, there were 62,000 nationwide.
Local regulations, demanded by streetcar companies, killed the jitney in most places.
By the end of 1916, only 6,000 jitneys remained.
Similarly, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in the 1920s, jitneys competed directly with the streetcar monopoly operating along the same routes as the streetcars, but jitneys were charging lower fares.
Operators were referred to as "jitney men."
They were so successful that the city government banned them at the request of the streetcar operators.
Since the 1973 oil crisis (as well as the mid-20th-century decline in transit service), jitneys have reappeared in some areas of the US, particularly in inner city areas once served by streetcars and private buses.
An increase in bus fares usually leads to a significant rise in jitney usage.
Liberalization of jitneys is often encouraged by libertarian urban economists, such as University of Chicago's Richard Epstein, Rutgers' James Dunn, and USC's Peter Gordon, as a more "market-friendly" alternative to public transportation.
Concerns over fares, insurance liabilities, and passenger safety have kept legislative support for jitneys decidedly tepid.
Nevertheless, in New York City and northern New Jersey, jitneys (known as "dollar vans" because of their original price) are regulated.
Miami has the country's most comprehensive jitney network, due to Caribbean influence.
In Atlanta jitneys run along Buford Highway.
In Atlantic City the ACJA operates a jitney service that travels the main strip of casinos.
One of the routes also services the new cluster of casinos west of Atlantic City proper.
In 2009, the Houston Waves, Houston's first jitney service in 17 years, started running.
It has expanded into a network of buses operating within Loop 610 and to all special event venues in Houston.
In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, “carros públicos” (literally "public cars") are share taxis.
Carros Publicos set routes with several passengers sharing the ride and others picked up throughout the journey.
In Puerto Rico the industry is regulated by the Puerto Rico Public Service Commission.
While these cars do travel inter-city, they may not be available for longer, cross-island travel.
Stations may exist in cities, and Puerto Rican carros públicos may congregate in specific places around town.
Along with traditional bus and minibus routes in some areas that the regular size buses couldn't fit due to the road and street height and width with small size.
but they are regulated in standard minibuses fares depending on the state and city of the country.
Colectivos operated as share taxis from the late 1920s until the 1950s in Buenos Aires, Argentina when they were integrated into the public transportation system.
Vehicles still known as colectivos operate throughout the country, but have long been indistinguishable from buses.
Often share taxi routes in Mexico are ad hoc arrangements to fill in gaps in regular public transportation, and many operate inter-city as well as local routes.
In many rural areas, they are the only public transportation.
In some cases, truck/taxi combination vehicles have evolved to transport light goods as well as passengers.
Heavily used share taxi routes often evolve into regulated microbus public transit routes, as has occurred in Mexico City and in Lima.
Taxis colectivos are also found in Perú, Chile, Guatemala, and Argentina, where they are most commonly referred to simply as colectivos, although in some places they have become essentially standard buses.
Modern Paratransit services, also known as demand responsive transport systems in the UK, can provide shared transport services in situations where scheduled services are not viable.
Traditionally these services had to be booked a day in advance, but are becoming increasingly responsive using modern communications systems with a central booking system accessed by phone or internet and instant communications with GPS-tracked vehicles.
Unlike scheduled services, the vehicles need not operate on fixed routes of timetables, although they do often have constrained routes.
Some newer taxi share systems now use internet and mobile phone communications for booking and scheduling purposes, with the actual service provided by normal hackney carriage or Private Hire vehicles.
Prospective passengers make bookings and supply destination details using SMS or mobile apps to a central server which aggregates these travel requests and creates packages of trips which are then communicated to drivers.
There are many operators of airport shuttle services between Airports and Hotels around the world that operate on flexible routing and timing to offer a service that is both cheaper than a sole-occupancy taxi and also often more convenient than other forms of public transport.
The requirement to carry luggage offers an added incentive to use such services over scheduled transport which will normally require a walk from the drop-off location to the final destination.
Services from these operators are starting to spread from airports to railway stations and to other locations.
Some operators and/or governments around the world are now offering demand-based shared transport to residents in communities with low ridership numbers, which could help maintain the existence of public transport.
Operations are predefined according to bookings.
A smart key is an electronic access and authorization system that is available either as standard equipment or an option in several car designs.
It was developed by Siemens in 1995 and introduced by Mercedes-Benz under the name "Keyless-Go" in 1998 on the W220 S-Class, after the design patent was filed by Daimler-Benz on May 17, 1997.
The smart key allows the driver to keep the key fob pocketed when unlocking, locking and starting the vehicle.
The key is identified via one of several antennas in the car's bodywork and an ISM band radio pulse generator in the key housing.
Depending on the system, the vehicle is automatically unlocked when a button or sensor on the door handle or trunk release is pressed.
Vehicles with a smart-key system have a mechanical backup, usually in the form of a spare key blade supplied with the vehicle.
Some manufacturers hide the backup lock behind a cover for styling.
Vehicles with a smart-key system can disengage the immobilizer and activate the ignition without inserting a key in the ignition, provided the driver has the key inside the car.
On most vehicles, this is done by pressing a starter button or twisting an ignition switch.
When leaving a vehicle that is equipped with a smart-key system, the vehicle is locked by either pressing a button on a door handle, touching a capacitive area on a door handle, or simply walking away from the vehicle.
The method of locking varies across models.
Some vehicles automatically adjust settings based on the smart key used to unlock the car.
User preferences such as seat positions, steering wheel position, exterior mirror settings, climate control (e.g. temperature) settings, and stereo presets are popular adjustments.
Some models, such as the Ford Escape, even have settings to prevent the vehicle from exceeding a maximum speed if it has been started with a certain key.
In 2005, the UK motor insurance research expert Thatcham introduced a standard for keyless entry, requiring the device to be inoperable at a distance of more than 10 cm from the vehicle.
In an independent test, the Nissan Micra's system was found to be the most secure, while certain BMW and Mercedes keys failed, being theoretically capable of allowing cars to be driven away while their owners were refueling.
Despite these security vulnerabilities, auto theft rates have decreased 7 percent between 2009 and 2010, and the National Insurance Crime Bureau credits smart keys for this decrease.
SmartKeys were developed by Siemens in the mid-1990s and introduced by Mercedes-Benz in 1997 to replace the infrared security system introduced in 1989.
Daimler-Benz filed the first patents for SmartKey on February 28, 1997, in German patent offices, with multifunction switchblade key variants following on May 17, 1997.
The device entailed a plastic key to be used in place of the traditional metal key.
Electronics that control locking systems and the ignitions made it possible to replace the traditional key with a sophisticated computerized "Key".
It is considered a step up from remote keyless entry.
The SmartKey adopts the remote control buttons from keyless entry, and incorporates them into the SmartKey fob.
Once inside a Mercedes-Benz vehicle, the SmartKey fob, unlike keyless entry fobs, is placed in the ignition slot where a starter computer verifies the rolling code.
Verified in milliseconds, it can then be turned as a traditional key to start the engine.
The device was designed with the cooperation of Siemens Automotive and Huf exclusively for Mercedes-Benz, but many luxury manufacturers have implemented similar technology based on the same idea.
In addition to the SmartKey, Mercedes-Benz now integrates as an option Keyless Go; this feature allows the driver to keep the SmartKey in their pocket, yet giving them the ability to open the doors, trunk as well as starting the car without ever removing it from their pocket.
The SmartKey's electronics are embedded in a hollow, triangular piece of plastic, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, squared-off at the tip with a half-inch-long insert piece.
The side of the SmartKey also hides a traditional Mercedes-Benz key that can be pulled out from a release at the top.
The metal key is used for valet purposes such as locking the glove compartment and/or trunk before the SmartKey is turned over to a parking attendant.
Once locked manually, the trunk cannot be opened with the SmartKey or interior buttons.
The key fob utilizes a radio-frequency transponder to communicate with the door locks, but it uses infrared to communicate with the engine immobilizer system.
The original SmartKeys had a limited frequency and could have only been used in line-of-sight for safety purposes.
The driver can also point the smart key at the front driver side door while pushing and holding the unlock button on the SmartKey and the windows and the sunroof will open in order to ventilate the cabin.
Similarly, if the same procedure is completed while holding the lock button, the windows and sunroof will close.
In cars equipped with the Active Ventilated Seats, the summer opening feature will activate seat ventilation in addition to opening the windows and sunroof.
Display Key is a type of smart key developed by BMW that includes a small LCD color touchscreen on it.
It performs the standard functions that a key fob would normally do such as locking, unlocking & keyless start, but because of the screen the user can also perform a number of the features from BMW's app.
One of which includes commanding the car to self park from the key if your car has self parking capability.
The key is currently available for the 3 Series, 4 Series, 5 Series, 6 Series, 7 Series, 8 Series, X3, X4, X5, X6, and X7.
The key is rechargeable and will last about 3 weeks.
It can be charged via a micro USB port on the side or wirelessly on the center console.
Keyless Go (also: Keyless Entry / Go; Passive Entry / Go) is Mercedes' term for an automotive technology which allows a driver to lock and unlock a vehicle without using the corresponding SmartKey buttons.
Once a driver enters a vehicle with an equipped Keyless Go SmartKey or Keyless Go wallet-size card, they have the ability to start and stop the engine, without inserting the SmartKey.
A transponder built within the SmartKey allows the vehicle to identify a driver.
An additional safety feature is integrated into the vehicle, making it impossible to lock a SmartKey with Keyless Go inside a vehicle.
The system works by having a series of LF (low frequency 125 kHz) transmitting antennas both inside and outside the vehicle.
The external antennas are located in the door handles.
When the vehicle is triggered, either by pulling the handle or touching the handle, an LF signal is transmitted from the antennas to the key.
The key becomes activated if it is sufficiently close and it transmits its ID back to the vehicle via RF (Radio frequency >300 MHz) to a receiver located in the vehicle.
If the key has the correct ID, the PASE module unlocks the vehicle.
The smart key determines if it is inside or outside the vehicle by measuring the strength of the LF fields.
In order to start the vehicle, the smart key must be inside the vehicle.
It is important that the vehicle can't be started when the user and therefore the smart key is outside the vehicle.
This is especially important at fueling stations where the user is very close to the vehicle.
The internal LF field is allowed to overshoot by a maximum of 10 cm to help minimise this risk.
Maximum overshoot is usually found on the side windows where there is very little attenuation of the signal.
Another possibility is using a motion sensor within the key fob.
Dead spots are a result of the maximum overshoot requirement from above.
The power delivered to the internal LF antennas has to be tuned to provide the best performance i.e. minimum dead spots and maximum average overshoot.
Dead spots are usually near the extremities of the vehicle e.g. the rear parcel shelf.
If the battery in the smart key becomes depleted, it is necessary for there to be a backup method of opening and starting the vehicle.
Opening is achieved by an emergency (fully mechanical) key blade usually hidden in the smart key.
On many cars emergency starting is achieved by use of an inductive coupling.
The user either has to put the key in a slot or hold it near a special area on the cockpit, where there is an inductive coil hidden behind which transfers energy to a matching coil in the dead key fob using inductive charging.
Slots have proven to be problematic, as they can go wrong and the key becomes locked in and cannot be removed.
Another problem with the slot is it can't compensate for a fob battery below certain operating threshold.
Most smart key batteries are temperature sensitive causing the fob to become intermittent, fully functional, or inoperative all in the same day.
A test by ADAC revealed that 20 car models with Keyless Go could be entered and driven away without the key.
In 2014, 6,000 cars (about 17 per day) were stolen using keyless entry in London.
Spark plug wires (also called high tension leads) are electrical cables used by older internal combustion engines to transmit high-voltage electricity from the distributor to the spark plugs .
Tension in this instance is a synonym for voltage.
High tension may also be referred to as HT.
Many modern engines use coil-on-plug ignition, a design that does not use spark plug wires.
Older ignition systems with a separate ignition coil use a coil wire between the ignition coil and the distributor.
A coil wire is of the same construction as a spark plug wire, but generally shorter and with different terminals.
Some distributors have an ignition coil built inside them, eliminating the need for a separate coil wire, such as the High Energy Ignition (HEI) system used by General Motors in the 1970s and 1980s.
Some engines instead used multiple ignition coils (one for each pair of cylinders) built into a coil pack, eliminating the need for a distributor and coil wire.
Many modern car engines use coil-on-plug ignition, which eliminates the need for spark plug wires.
Diesel engines do not use spark plugs, and therefore do not use spark plug wires either.
Snow tires, also known as winter tires, are tires designed for use on snow and ice.
Snow tires have a tread design with larger gaps than those on conventional tires, increasing traction on snow and ice.
Such tires that have passed specific winter traction performance tests are entitled to display a 3PMSF (Three-Peak Mountain Snow Flake) and/or a IMP (Icy Mountain Peak) symbols on their sidewalls.
Tires designed for winter conditions are optimized to drive at temperatures below 7 °C (45 °F).
Studded tires are a type of snow tires which have metal or ceramic studs that protrude from the tire to increase traction on hard-packed snow or ice.
Studs abrade dry pavement, causing dust and creating wear in the wheel path.
Regulations that require the use of snow tires or permit the use of studs vary by country in Asia and Europe, and by state or province in North America.
All-season tires have tread gaps that are smaller than snow tires and larger than conventional tires.
They are quieter than winter tires on clear roads, but less capable on snow or ice.
Snow tires operate on a variety of surfaces, including pavement (wet or dry), mud, ice, or snow.
The tread design of snow tires is adapted primarily to allow penetration of the snow into the tread, where it compacts and provides resistance against slippage.
The snow strength developed by compaction depends on the properties of the snow, which depend on its temperature and water content—wetter, warmer snow compacts better than dry, colder snow up to a point where the snow is so wet that it lubricates the tire-road interface.
New and powder snow have densities of 0.1 to 0.3 g/cm3 (6 to 20 lb/cu ft).
Compacted snow may have densities  of 0.45 to 0.75 g/cm3 (28 to 47 lb/cu ft).
Snow or ice-covered roadways present lower braking and cornering friction, compared to dry conditions.
The roadway friction properties of snow, in particular, are a function of temperature.
At temperatures below −7 °C (20 °F), snow crystals are harder and generate more friction as a tire passes over them than at warmer conditions with snow or ice on the road surface.
However, as temperatures rise above −2 °C (28 °F), the presence of free water increasingly lubricates the snow or ice and diminishes tire friction.
Hydrophilic rubber compounds help create friction in the presence of water or ice.
Additional siping, or thin slits in the rubber, that provide more biting edges and improve traction on wet or icy surfaces.
Wet-film conditions on hard-compacted snow or ice require studs or chains.
Many jurisdictions in Asia, Europe, and North America seasonally allow snow tires with metal or ceramic studs to improve grip on packed snow or ice.
Such tires are prohibited in other jurisdictions or during warmer months because of the damage they may cause to road surfaces.
The metal studs are fabricated by encapsulating a hard pin in a softer material base, sometimes called the jacket.
The pin is often made of tungsten carbide, a very hard high performance ceramic.
The softer base is the part that anchors the stud in the rubber of the tire.
As the tire wears with use, the softer base wears so that its surface is at about the same level as the rubber, whereas the hard pin wears so that it continues to protrude from the tire.
The pin should protrude at least 1 millimetre (0.04 in) for the tire to function properly.
Snow tires do not eliminate skidding on ice and snow, but they greatly reduce risks.
Studdable tires are manufactured with molded holes on the rubber tire tread.
Usually, there are 80 to 100 molded holes per tire for stud insertion.
The insertion is done by using a special tool that spreads the rubber hole so that a stud jacket can be inserted and the flange at the bottom of the jacket can be fitted nicely to the bottom of the hole.
The metal studs come in specific heights to match the depths of the holes molded into the tire tread based on the tread depths.
For this reason, stud metals can only be inserted when the tires have not been driven on.
A proper stud insertion results in the metal jacket that is flush with the surface of the tire tread having only the pin part that protrudes.
The compacted snow develops strength against slippage along a shear plane parallel to the contact area of the tire on the ground.
At the same time, the bottom of the tire treads compress the snow on which they are bearing, also creating friction.
The process of compacting snow within the treads requires it to be expelled in time for the tread to compact snow anew on the next rotation.
The compaction/contact process works both in the direction of travel for propulsion and braking, but also laterally for cornering.
The deeper the snow that the tire rolls through, the higher the resistance encountered by the tire, as it compacts the snow it encounters and plows some of it to either side.
At some point on a given angle of uphill pitch, this resistance becomes greater than the resistance to slippage achieved by the tread's contact with the snow and the tires with power begin to slip and spin.
Deeper snow means that climbing a hill without spinning the powered wheels becomes more difficult.
However, the plowing/compaction effect aids in braking to the extent that it creates rolling resistance.
The 3PMSF (Three-Peak Mountain Snow Flake) indicates 10% better acceleration on snow.
The IMP (Icy Mountain Peak) indicates 18% better deceleration on ice.
All prefectures of Japan, except for the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa, have a traffic regulation requiring motorized vehicles to be fitted with winter tires or tire chains when the road is covered by ice or snow.
In addition, tire chains must be fitted for all vehicles on rural designated highways in snow country regions when regulated by traffic signs requiring tire chains.
In many prefectures, tread grooves of snow tires are worn off for more than 50% of their original depth, tires must be replaced to meet the legal requirements.
Drivers will be fined for failing to comply with the snow tire or tire chains requirements, and checkpoints are in place on major highways.
Nationwide studded tire restrictions in Japan for passenger vehicles came into effect in April 1991, followed by restrictions for commercial trucks in 1993.
Studded tires are still legal in Japan, but their usage is restricted by environmental law and it is a criminal offence to operate a vehicle fitted with a studded tire on dry asphalt or concrete.
As of 2016, regulations pertaining to snow tires in Europe varied by country.
The principal aspects of regulations were whether the use was mandatory and whether studded tires were permitted.
Mandatory use – The following countries required snow tires between specified dates or when roads are snowy or icy: Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Norway, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Russia.
Studded tires banned – The following countries ban the use of studded tires: Albania, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.
Studded tires restricted – The following countries allowed the seasonally restricted use of studded tires:
Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Transport Canada allow display of a 3PMSF symbol to indicate that the tire has exceeded the industry requirement from a reference (non-snow) tire.
As of 2016, snow tires were 3.6% of the US market and 35% of the Canadian market.
US states and Canadian provinces control the use of snow tires.
Of these, Quebec is the only jurisdiction that requires snow tires throughout.
Some may require snow tires or chains only in specified areas during the winter.
Sport compact is a United States marketing classification for a high-performance version of a compact or a subcompact car.
There is no precise definition, and the description is applied to various models for promotional purposes.
Cars began to be marketed as sport compacts in the mid-1980s to describe the option packages on American-built coupes.
Since then, it has also been used for standalone sports car models and cars imported from Europe and Asia.
The European equivalent is a hot hatch.
However, sport compacts are not limited to hatchback body styles.
A sports compact should "fulfill the multiple duties of a family car, plaything, and daily driver".
Many sports compacts have coupe, sedan, or hatchback body styles built on mass-production platforms.
Other common (but not essential) characteristics include front-wheel or all-wheel drive, a four-cylinder internal-combustion engine, suspension tuned for handling, and bodywork designed to improve aerodynamics or allow for larger wheels.
"Econosport" is a rarely used term for a sports version of a small economy car.
An early sport compact was the 1968 Ford Capri, a European coupe built on the platform of the second-generation Ford Cortina sedans.
The early American-built sport compact models contained optional performance or sporting packages for mass-produced compact coupes in the 1980s.
Examples include the 1986 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24, the 1986 Ford EXP Sport Coupe, the 1987 Renault Alliance GTA, and the 1988 Plymouth Sundance.
These models achieved moderate sales.
Sport compact models gained greater prominence by the mid-1990s, sold in significant numbers in models such as the 1993 Ford Probe (based on the Mazda MX-6 platform), and the 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier/Pontiac Sunfire badge-engineered twins.
Sports compacts of the 2000s include the 2001-2003 Ford ZX2, the 2004-2007 Saturn Ion Red Line, the 2005-2010 Chevrolet Cobalt SS, and the 2003-2005 Dodge Neon SRT-4.
European hot hatches are considered 'sport compact' cars in the North American market.
Examples include the 1976-present Volkswagen Golf GTI and the 2000-present Mini Cooper.
Similarly, most Japanese hot hatches and sports coupes are classified as 'sport compact' cars when sold in North America, for example, the 1984-present Honda Civic Si, 2007-2013 Mazdaspeed3, and the 2012-present Toyota 86.
Sport compact cars are often used in motorsport events because they are relatively lightweight.
They are used to compete in various types of motorsport, including autocross, rallying, rallycross, touring car racing, drifting, and drag racing.
From 2005 through 2012, the International Sport Compact Auto Racing Series was an American stock car racing series for sports compacts that mostly raced on paved oval racetracks.
When replacing a damaged tire, placing the compact spare on a non-drive axle will prevent damage to the drivetrain.
If placed on a drivetrain axle, the smaller-diameter tire can put stress on the differential causing damage and reducing handling.
To alleviate this time-consuming process, Walter and Tom Davies of Llanelli, Wales, invented the spare tire in 1904.
At the time, motor cars were made without spare wheels.
The wheel was so successful that the brothers started their own company, Stepney Spare Motor Wheel Limited, (named after the location of their workshop on Stepney Street In Llanelli) and started marketing the wheel in Britain, Europe, and the British Empire and colonies.
The word "stepney" is sometimes used interchangeably in countries that were once part of the British Empire such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, and Malta.
The first to equip cars with an inflated spare wheel-and-tire assembly were the Ramblers made by Thomas B. Jeffery Company.
The Rambler's interchangeable wheel with a mounted and inflated spare tire meant the motorist could exchange it quickly for the punctured tire that could then be repaired at a more convenient time and place.
The pre-mounted spare tire and wheel combination proved so popular with motorists that carrying up to two spare tires became common.
Automakers often equipped cars with one or dual sidemounts.
The spares were mounted behind the front fenders as they blended into the running boards (a narrow footboard serving as a step beneath the doors).
In 1941, the U.S. government temporarily prohibited spare tires on new cars as part of the nation's World War II rationing strategy, which led to quotas and laws designed to force conservation, including rubber that was produced overseas and difficult to get.
A similar ration prohibition was also implemented by the U.S. during the Korean War in 1951.
Contemporary vehicles may come equipped with full-size spares, limited use minispares, or have run-flat capability.
The spare tire may be identical type and size to those on the vehicle.
The spare may either be mounted on a plain steel rim or a matching road wheel as found on the vehicle.
Among passenger vehicles, full-sized spares are usually provided for sport utility vehicles and light trucks, since a "limited use" spare would adversely affect such vehicles with higher centers of gravity.
Additionally, a "limited use" spare may not be safe on a fully loaded truck or one that is towing a trailer.
Due to the size of the full-sized spare, it is often mounted on the outside, such as the rear door of SUVs, and occasionally on the front hood.
Many vehicles are provided with a "limited use" spare tire, also known as a "space-saver", temporary spare, "donut", or "compact" spare tire — in an attempt to reduce cost, lower the vehicle's weight, or conserve the space that would be needed for a full-size spare tire.
Introduced in the late 1970s, as of 2017, temporary spares come standard on 53 percent of 2017 models in the U.S.
A space-saver is typically 7 kg (15 lb) lighter than a full-sized wheel and in some cars the so-called 'space-saver' may actually save little to no space.
There is also the difficulty of transporting the full-sized wheel and tire once the space-saver has been fitted.
The spare is usually mounted on a plain steel rim.
They are typically smaller than the normal tires on the vehicle and can only be used for limited distances because of their short life expectancy and low speed rating.
As well, due to the different size of a donut compared to regular wheel, electronic stability control and traction control systems will not operate properly and should be disabled until the original wheel is restored.
Space saver spare tires could potentially compromise the braking (especially on cars not fitted with anti-lock brakes) and handling of the car.
In some cases, automobiles may be equipped with run-flat tires and thus not require a separate spare tire.
Other vehicles may carry a can of tire repair foam, to repair punctured tires, although these often do not work in the case of larger punctures, and are useless in the event of a blow-out.
Newer vehicles often do not come with a spare tire at all.
The reduction of a spare tire increases fuel economy, cost of vehicle, as well as reducing production waste.
Spare tires in automobiles are often stored in a spare tire well – a recessed area in the trunk of a vehicle, usually in the center, where the spare tire is stored while not in use.
In most cars, the spare tire is secured with a bolt and wing-nut style fastener.
Usually a stiff sheet of cardboard lies on top of the spare tire well with the trunk carpet on top of it to hide the spare tire and provide a pleasant look to and a flat surface for the trunk space.
Other storage locations include a cradle underneath the rear of the vehicle.
This cradle is usually secured by a bolt that is accessible from inside the trunk, for security.
This arrangement has advantages over storing the tire inside the trunk, including not having to empty the contents of the trunk to access the wheel and this arrangement may also save space in some applications.
However it has disadvantages because that tire gets dirty, making the act of changing the tire more unpleasant and the mechanism may also rust on older cars, making it difficult to free the spare.
The cradle arrangement is usually only practical on front wheel drive cars, as the cradle would get in the way of the rear axle on most rear or four wheel drive cars.
A similar arrangement is also often found on trucks where the spare is often stored beneath the truck bed.
Many sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and off-road vehicles have the spare wheel mounted externally – usually on the rear door, but others may mount them on the roof, the side, or even on the bonnet (hood).
In mid-engined and rear-engined cars, the spare tire is generally stored in the front boot.
Some vehicles stored the spare tire in the engine bay, such as the Renault 14, First generation Fiat Panda and older Subaru vehicles, such as the Subaru Leone.
Vehicles like the Volkswagen Beetle used spare tires for ancillary purposes such as supplying air pressure to the windscreen washer system.
Many models of Bristol cars - those from the 404 of 1953 to the Fighter of 2004 carried a full-size spare wheel and tire in a pannier compartment built into the left-hand wing.
This not only increased luggage space and allowed easy access to the spare without having to unload the trunk but improved weight distribution by keeping as much mass as possible within the wheelbase and balancing the weight of the battery, mounted in a similar compartment in the right-hand wing.
The spinner on automobile wheels historically refers to knock-off hub nuts or center caps.
They may be the actual, or intended to simulate, the design used on antique vehicles or vintage sports cars.
A "spinner wheel" in contemporary usage is a type of hubcap or inner wheel ornament, that spins independently inside of a wheel itself when the vehicle is in motion and continues to spin once the vehicle has come to a stop.
The spinner or "knock-off" originated with Rudge-Whitworth center lock wire wheels and hubs, which were first patented in 1908.
The spinner was a threaded, winged nut designed to keep the wheel fastened to the hub.
They were screwed on and "knocked on tightly" using a hammer, hence the name "knock-offs".
Most setups will feature right-hand threads on the left side of the vehicle, and left-hand threads (rotate clockwise to remove) on the vehicle's right side so the screw-on spinner would stay tightened as the auto was in forward motion.
This style of "knock-off" wheel was common on road cars until the development of the lug nut method attaching the wheel.
The spinner hubcap was introduced into the commercial vehicle and passenger automobile market in the 1930s.
Automotive designer Harley Earl expressed a brash philosophy behind his 1950s automobiles that included "glittering spinner hubcaps."
During the 1950s and 1960s automobile manufacturers offered simulated wire wheel covers for a look of luxury that featured crisscrossing spokes designed to look like the real wire wheels that were used on vehicles in the 1920s and 1930s.
These "spinner-wheel covers" were available on standard as well as featured on custom cars, and lowriders quickly adapted them for their vehicles.
During the early-1960s, the simulated wire wheel covers returned, but with a new look designed to emphasize sportiness with their radiating spokes and center "spinner caps."
These classic center spinner caps feature a rigidly mounted propeller-like center element, usually with two or three projecting "blades."
They were intended to simulate the knock-off hubs that were used on vintage racing vehicles and classic sports cars where a hammer or special wrench was used on the spinner to release or tighten the wheel to the hub.
These spinner hubcaps were most often an optional appearance upgrade to the standard equipment hubcaps or full wheel covers that attached to stamped steel wheels.
Top trim models sometimes included spinner wheel covers as standard equipment to appeal to youthful customers.
In the late 1960s, U.S. Federal safety standards banned the use of protruding bar spinners on automobiles.
The mid-1950s Dodge four-bladed "spinner" wheel covers became an icon for the era and also became an item popular to owners to customize their cars.
Spinners were an add-on accessory marketed during the 1950s to decorate regular wheel covers for a custom look.
Center spinner hubcaps were also available as original equipment from automakers.
Custom wheels for lowriders also used naked ladies on wheel covers, and these were the first to feature a floating or spinner-type wheel device.
A bracket was used to mount to the spindle, so while the lady stood still the wheel spun around.
Similarly, the Rolls-Royce Phantom has anti-spinners – the "RR" logo in the center of the hub is mounted on a spinner or gyroscopic mechanism with an offset weight designed to ensure that the logo is always the right way up when the car is parked.
The hubometers used on large trucks, buses, and trailers that appear to be stationary while the wheel is turning to accurately measure the actual distance covered.
They are enclosed and float in a liquid with anti-freeze to be functional in severe low temperatures without freezing.
The modern spinner device is a decorative kinetic attachment to the wheel of an automobile.
The spinner covers the center of a car's wheel and is designed to independently rotate by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel, enabling it to turn while the wheel is at rest.
Legislative bills were proposed in several US states to ban spinner-type wheels and hubcaps that simulate movement even when a vehicle is stopped because they could be disconcerting to other motorists and present a safety hazard.
Spinners were popular during the early-2000s within the hip-hop community of the United States.
Since the mid-2000s, they are gradually fading out of vogue in popular culture.
The spinner-type automobile hubcaps were the inspiration for a Detroit-area R&B/soul group, The Domingoes, to rename themselves The Spinners in the late 1950s.
In 1960, Pat Davis recorded the song "Spinner Hub Caps".
In 2003, as spinning rims were in the height of their popularity in hip-hop culture, Three 6 Mafia released the song "Ridin' Spinners".
The song title refers to driving while having spinning rims installed on the car.
In the first line of the song, DJ Paul urges all the "players out there ridin' spinners" to "stop, and let 'em keep spinnin' baby", and the chorus repeatedly proclaims that the spinners "don't stop".
The song was on the album Da Unbreakables, which was certified gold by the RIAA.
Smart growth is an urban planning and transportation theory that concentrates growth in compact walkable urban centers to avoid sprawl.
It also advocates compact, transit-oriented, walkable, bicycle-friendly land use, including neighborhood schools, complete streets, and mixed-use development with a range of housing choices.
The term "smart growth" is particularly used in North America.
In Europe and particularly the UK, the terms "compact city", "urban densification" or "urban intensification" have often been used to describe similar concepts, which have influenced government planning policies in the UK, the Netherlands and several other European countries.
Smart growth values long-range, regional considerations of sustainability over a short-term focus.
Its sustainable development goals are to achieve a unique sense of community and place; expand the range of transportation, employment, and housing choices; equitably distribute the costs and benefits of development; preserve and enhance natural and cultural resources; and promote public health.
Smart growth is a theory of land development that accepts that growth and development will continue to occur, and so seeks to direct that growth in an intentional, comprehensive way.
Its proponents include urban planners, architects, developers, community activists, and historic preservationists.
The term "smart growth" is an attempt to reframe the conversation from "growth" versus "no growth" (or NIMBY) to good/smart growth versus bad/dumb growth.
Proponents seek to distinguish smart growth from urban sprawl, which they claim causes most of the problems that fuel opposition to urban growth, such as traffic congestion and environmental degradation.
Smart growth principles are directed at developing sustainable communities that provide a greater range of transportation and housing choices and prioritize infill and redevelopment in existing communities rather than development of "greenfield" farmland or natural lands.
Some of the fundamental aims for the benefits of residents and the communities are increasing family income and wealth, providing safe walking routes to schools, fostering livable, safe and healthy places, stimulating economic activity (both locally and regionally), and developing, preserving and investing in built and natural resources.
Smart growth "principles" describe the elements of community that are envisioned and smart growth "regulations" describe the various approaches to implementation, that is, how federal, state, and municipal governments choose to fulfill smart growth principles.
Some of these regulatory approaches such as urban growth boundaries predate the use of the term "smart growth".
One of the earliest efforts to establish smart growth forward as an explicit regulatory framework were put forth by the American Planning Association (APA).
In 1997, the APA introduced a project called Growing Smart and published the "Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook: Model Statutes for Planning and the Management of Change."
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines smart growth as “a range of development and conservation strategies that help protect our health and natural environment and make our communities more attractive, economically stronger, and more socially diverse."
Smart growth agenda is comprehensive and ambitious, however, its implementation is problematic as control of outward movement means limiting availability of single-family homes and reliance on the automobile, the mainstay of the traditional American lifestyle.
The smart growth approach to development is multifaceted and can encompass a variety of techniques.
For example, in the state of Massachusetts smart growth is enacted by a combination of techniques including increasing housing density along transit nodes, conserving farm land, and mixing residential and commercial use areas.
Perhaps the most descriptive term to characterize this concept is Traditional Neighborhood Development, which recognizes that smart growth and related concepts are not necessarily new, but are a response to car culture and sprawl.
Many favor the term New Urbanism, which invokes a new, but traditional way of looking at urban planning.
There are a range of best practices associated with smart growth.
These include supporting existing communities, redeveloping underutilized sites, enhancing economic competitiveness, providing more transportation choices, developing livability measures and tools, promoting equitable and affordable housing, providing a vision for sustainable growth, enhancing integrated planning and investment, aligning, coordinating, and leveraging government policies, redefining housing affordability and making the development process transparent.
Related, but somewhat different, are the overarching goals of smart growth, and they include: making the community more competitive for new businesses, providing alternative places to shop, work, and play, creating a better "Sense of Place," providing jobs for residents, increasing property values, improving quality of life, expanding the tax base, preserving open space, controlling growth, and improving safety.

Transportation and community planners began to promote the idea of compact cities and communities and adopt many of the regulatory approaches associated with smart growth in the early 1970s.
The cost and difficulty of acquiring land (particularly in historic and/or areas designated as conservancies) to build and widen highways caused some politicians to reconsider basing transportation planning on motor vehicles.
The Congress for the New Urbanism, with architect Peter Calthorpe, promoted and popularized the idea of urban villages that relied on public transportation, bicycling, and walking instead of automobile use.
Architect Andrés Duany promoted changing design codes to promote a sense of community, and to discourage driving.
Colin Buchanan and Stephen Plowden helped to lead the debate in the United Kingdom.
The Local Government Commission which presents the annual New Partners for Smart Growth conference adopted the original Ahwahnee Principles in 1991 which articulates many of the major principles now generally accepted as part of the smart growth movement such as transit oriented development, a focus on walking distance, greenbelts and wildlife corridors, and infill and redevelopment.
The document was co-authored by several of the founders of the New Urbanist movement.
The Local Government Commission has been co-sponsoring smart growth-related conferences since 1997.
The New Partners for Smart Growth Conference started under that name circa 2002.
Smart Growth America, an organization devoted to promoting smart growth in the United States, was founded in 2002.
This organization leads an evolving coalition of national and regional organizations most of which predated its founding such as 1000 Friends of Oregon, founded in 1975, and the Congress for the New Urbanism, founded in 1993.
The EPA launched its smart growth program in 1995.
Smart growth is an alternative to urban sprawl, traffic congestion, disconnected neighborhoods, and urban decay.
Its principles challenge old assumptions in urban planning, such as the value of detached houses and automobile use.
Environmentalists promote smart growth by advocating urban-growth boundaries, or Green belts, as they have been termed in England since the 1930s.
Transit-oriented development can improve the quality of life and encourage a healthier, pedestrian-based lifestyle with less pollution.
EPA suggests that smart growth can help reduce air pollution, improve water quality, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Smart growth advocates claim that much of the urban sprawl of the 20th century was due to government subsidies for infrastructure that redistribute the true costs of sprawl.
Examples include subsidies for highway building, fossil fuels, and electricity.
With electricity, there is a cost associated with extending and maintaining the service delivery system, as with water and sewage, but there also is a loss in the commodity being delivered.
The farther from the generator, the more power is lost in distribution.
According to the Department of Energy's (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA), 9 percent of energy is lost in transmission.
Current average cost pricing, where customers pay the same price per unit of power regardless of the true cost of their service, subsidizes sprawl development.
With electricity deregulation, some states now charge customers/developers fees for extending distribution to new locations rather than rolling such costs into utility rates.
New Jersey, for example, has implemented a plan that divides the state into five planning areas, some of which are designated for growth, while others are protected.
The state is developing a series of incentives to coax local governments into changing zoning laws that will be compatible with the state plan.
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently proposed a revised rule that presents a tiered approach to utility financing.
In areas not designated for growth, utilities and their ratepayers are forbidden to cover the costs of extending utility lines to new developments—and developers will be required to pay the full cost of public utility infrastructure.
In designated growth areas that have local smart plans endorsed by the State Planning Commission, developers will be refunded the cost of extending utility lines to new developments at two times the rate of the revenue received by developers in smart growth areas that do not have approved plans.
Growth is "smart growth", to the extent that it includes the elements listed below.
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design.
This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl.
Both trends started in the 1980s.
Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a residential or commercial area designed to maximize access to public transport, and mixed-use/compact neighborhoods tend to use transit at all times of the day.
Biking and walking instead of driving can reduce emissions, save money on fuel and maintenance, and foster a healthier population.
Pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly improvements include bike lanes on main streets, an urban bike-trail system, bike parking, pedestrian crossings, and associated master plans.
The most pedestrian- and bike-friendly variant of smart growth and New Urbanism is New Pedestrianism because motor vehicles are on a separate grid.
Setting aside large areas where development is prohibited, nature is able to run its course, providing fresh air and clean water.
Expansion around already existing areas allows public services to be located where people are living without taking away from the core city neighborhoods in large urban areas.
Developing around preexisting areas decreases the socioeconomic segregation allowing society to function more equitably, generating a tax base for housing, educational and employment programs.
The most widely used tool for achieving smart growth is modification of local zoning laws.
Zoning laws are applicable to most cities and counties in the United States.
Smart growth advocates often seek to modify zoning ordinances to increase the density of development and redevelopment allowed in or near existing towns and neighborhoods and/or restrict new development in outlying or environmentally sensitive areas.
Additional density incentives can be offered for development of brownfield and greyfield land or for providing amenities such as parks and open space.
Zoning ordinances typically include minimum parking requirements.
Reductions in or elimination of parking minimums or imposition of parking maximums can also reduce the amount of parking built with new development increasing land available for parks and other community amenities.
Related to zoning ordinances, an urban growth boundary (UGB) is a tool used in some U.S. cities to contain high density development to certain areas.
The first urban growth boundary in the United States was established in 1958 in Kentucky.
Subsequently, urban growth boundaries were established in Oregon in the 1970s and Florida in the 1980s.
Some believe that UGBs contributed to the escalation of housing prices from 2000 to 2006, as they limited the supply of developable land.
However, this is not completely substantiated because prices continued to rise even after municipalities expanded their growth boundaries.
Transfer of development rights (TDR) systems are intended to allow property owners in areas deemed desirable for growth (such as infill and brownfield sites) to purchase the right to build at higher densities from owners of properties in areas deemed undesirable for growth such as environmental lands, farmlands or lands outside of an urban growth boundary.
TDR programs have been implemented in over 200 U.S. communities.
Systematic provision of infrastructure such as schools, libraries, sporting facilities and community facilities is an integral component of smart growth communities.
This is commonly known as 'social infrastructure' or 'community infrastructure'.
In Australia, for example, most new suburban developments are master planned, and key social infrastructure is planned at the outset.
One popular approach to assist in smart growth in democratic countries is for lawmakers to require prospective developers to prepare environmental impact assessments of their plans as a condition for state and/or local governments to give them permission to build their buildings.
These reports often indicate how significant impacts generated by the development will be mitigated, the cost of which is usually paid by the developer.
These assessments are frequently controversial.
Conservationists, neighborhood advocacy groups and NIMBYs are often skeptical about such impact reports, even when they are prepared by independent agencies and subsequently approved by the decision makers rather than the promoters.
Conversely, developers will sometimes strongly resist being required to implement the mitigation measures required by the local government as they may be quite costly.
In communities practicing these smart growth policies, developers comply with local codes and requirements.
Consequently, developer compliance builds communal trust because it demonstrates a genuine interest in the environmental quality of the community.

In May 2011, The European Union released a Regional Policy report for smart growth policy for 2020.
The Regional Policy report stated smart specialization was the strategy to focus Europe's resources and administer smart growth principles.
In July 2011, The Atlantic magazine called the BeltLine, a series of housing, trail, and transit projects along a 22-mile (35-km) long disused rail corridor surrounding the core of Atlanta, the United States' "most ambitious smart growth project".
In Savannah, Georgia (US) the historic Oglethorpe Plan has been shown to contain most of the elements of smart growth in its network of wards, each of which has a central civic square.
The plan has demonstrated its resilience to changing conditions, and the city is using the plan as a model for growth in newer areas.
In Melbourne, Australia, almost all new outer-suburban developments are master planned, guided by the principles of smart growth.
Whether smart growth (or the "compact City") does or can reduce problems of automobile dependency associated with urban sprawl have been fiercely contested issues over several decades.
A 2007 meta-study by Keith Barthomomew of the University of Utah found that reductions in driving associated with compact development scenarios averaged 8 percent ranging up to 31.7 percent with the variation being explained by degree of land use mixing and density.
An influential study in 1989 by Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia.
The study has been criticised for its methodology  but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted — although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.
Within cities studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas.
This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income.
This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however.
One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport.
Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour.
More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.
Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour Melia et al.
(2011) found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of smart growth.
Planning policies which increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.
For example, Portland, Oregon a U.S. city which has pursued smart growth policies, substantially increased its population density between 1990 and 2000 when other US cities of a similar size were reducing in density.
As predicted by the paradox, traffic volumes and congestion both increased more rapidly than in the other cities, despite a substantial increase in transit use.
These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states "Ceteris paribus, urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs".
At the citywide level it may be possible, through a range of positive measures to counteract the increases in traffic and congestion which would otherwise result from increasing population densities: Freiburg
im Breisgau in Germany is one example of a city which has been more successful in this respect.
This study also reviewed evidence on the local effects of building at higher densities.
At the level of the neighbourhood or individual development positive measures (e.g. improvements to public transport) will usually be insufficient to counteract the traffic effect of increasing population density.
This leaves policy-makers with four choices: intensify and accept the local consequences, sprawl and accept the wider consequences, a compromise with some element of both, or intensify accompanied by more radical measures such as parking restrictions, closing roads to traffic and carfree zones.
In contrast, the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts reported that its Kendall Square neighborhood saw a 40% increase in commercial space attended by a traffic decrease of 14%.
A report by CEOs for Cities, "Driven Apart," showed that while denser cities in the United States may have more congested commutes they are also shorter on average in both time and distance.
This is in contrast to cities where commuters face less congestion but drive longer distances resulting in commutes that take as long or longer.
Our analysis indicates that the Current Urban Planning Assumptions are of virtually no value in predicting local government expenditures per capita.
The lowest local government expenditures per capita are not in the higher density, slower growing, and older municipalities.
On the contrary, the actual data indicate that the lowest expenditures per capita tend to be in medium- and lower-density municipalities (though not the lowest density); medium- and faster-growing municipalities; and newer municipalities.
This is after 50 years of unprecedented urban decentralization, which seems to be more than enough time to have developed the purported urban sprawl-related higher local government expenditures.
It seems unlikely that the higher expenditures that did not develop due to sprawl in the last 50 years will evolve in the next 20 - despite predictions to the contrary in The Costs of Sprawl 2000 research.
It seems much more likely that the differences in municipal expenditures per capita are the result of political, rather than economic factors, especially the influence of special interests.
The phrase "smart growth" implies that other growth and development theories are not "smart".
There is debate about whether transit-proximate development constitutes smart growth when it is not transit-oriented.
The National Motorists Association does not object to smart growth as a whole, but strongly objects to traffic calming, which is intended to reduce automobile accidents and fatalities, but may also reduce automobile usage and increase alternate forms of public transportation.
In 2002 the National Center for Public Policy Research, a self-described conservative think tank, published an economic study entitled "Smart Growth and Its Effects on Housing Markets: The New Segregation" which termed smart growth "restricted growth" and suggested that smart growth policies disfavor minorities and the poor by driving up housing prices.
Some libertarian groups, such as the Cato Institute, criticize smart growth on the grounds that it leads to greatly increased land values, and people with average incomes can no longer afford to buy detached houses.
A number of ecological economists claim that industrial civilization has already "overshot" the carrying capacity of the Earth, and "smart growth" is mostly an illusion.
Instead, a steady state economy would be needed to bring human societies back into a necessary balance with the ability of the ecosystem to sustain humans (and other species).
A study released in November 2009 characterized the smart-growth policies in the U.S. state of Maryland as a failure, concluding that "[t]here is no evidence after ten years that [smart-growth laws] have had any effect on development patterns."
Factors include a lack of incentives for builders to redevelop older neighborhoods and limits on the ability of state planners to force local jurisdictions to approve high-density developments in "smart-growth" areas.
Buyers demand low-density development and voters tend to oppose high density developments near them.
Beginning in 2010, groups generally associated with the Tea Party movement began to identify Smart Growth as an outgrowth of the United Nations Agenda 21 which they viewed as an attempt by international interests to force a "sustainable" lifestyle on the United States.
However planning groups and even some smart growth opponents counter that Smart Growth concepts and groups predate the 1992 Agenda 21 conference.
In addition the word "sustainable development" as used in the Agenda 21 report is often misread to mean real estate development when it typically refers to the much broader concept of human development in the United Nations and foreign aid context which addresses a broader slate of economic, health, poverty, and education issues.
The term "spoiler" is often mistakenly used interchangeably with "wing".
An automotive wing is a device designed to generate downforce as air passes around it, not simply disrupt existing airflow patterns.
As such, rather than decreasing drag, automotive wings actually increase drag.
Since spoiler is a term describing an application, the operation of a spoiler varies depending on the particular effect it is trying to spoil.
Common spoiler functions include disrupting airflow passing over and around a moving vehicle.
A standard spoiler diffuses air by increasing amounts of turbulence flowing over the shape, "spoiling" the laminar flow and providing a cushion for the laminar boundary layer.
However, other types of airflow may require the spoiler to operate differently and take on vastly different physical characteristics.
While a mass travels at increasing speeds, the environment's air affects its movement.
Spoilers in racing are combined with other features on the body or chassis of race cars to change the handling characteristics that are affected by the air of the environment.
Often, these devices are designed to be highly adjustable to suit the needs of racing on a given track or to suit the talents of a particular driver, with the overall goal of reaching faster times.
The goal of many spoilers used in passenger vehicles is to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency.
Passenger vehicles can be equipped with front and rear spoilers.
Front spoilers, found beneath the bumper, are mainly used to decrease the air going underneath the vehicle to reduce the drag coefficient and lift.
Sports cars are most commonly seen with front and rear spoilers.
Even though these vehicles typically have a more rigid chassis and a stiffer suspension to aid in high-speed maneuverability, a spoiler can still be beneficial.
This is because many cars have a relatively steep downward angle going from the rear edge of the roof down to the vehicle's trunk or tail, which may cause airflow separation.
The flow of air becomes turbulent, and a low-pressure zone is created, increasing drag and instability (see Bernoulli effect).
Adding a rear spoiler could be considered to make the air "see" a longer, gentler slope from the roof to the spoiler, which helps to delay flow separation and the higher pressure in front of the spoiler can help reduce the lift on the car by creating downforce .
This may reduce drag in certain instances and generally increase high-speed stability due to the reduced rear lift.
ABS plastic: Most original equipment manufacturers produce spoilers by casting ABS plastic with various admixtures, typically granular fillers, which introduce stiffness to this inexpensive material.
Frailness is the main disadvantage of plastic, which increases with product age and is caused by the evaporation of volatile phenols.
Fiberglass: Used in car parts production due to the low cost of the materials.
Fiberglass spoilers consist of fiberglass cloth infiltrated with a thermosetting resin, such as epoxy.
Fiberglass is sufficiently durable and workable, but has become unprofitable for large-scale production because of the labor involved.
Silicone: Some auto accessory manufacturers have recently used silicon-organic polymers.
The main benefit of this material is its phenomenal plasticity.
Silicone possesses extra high thermal characteristics and provides a longer product lifetime.
Carbon fiber: Carbon fiber is lightweight, durable, and expensive.
Due to a large amount of manual labor, large-scale production cannot widely use carbon fiber in automobile parts currently.
Front spoilers: A front spoiler (air dam) is positioned under or integrated with the front bumper.
In racing, this spoiler controls the dynamics of handling related to the air in front of the vehicle.
This can be to improve the drag coefficient of the vehicle's body at speed or generate downforce.
In passenger vehicles, the focus shifts to directing the airflow into the engine bay for cooling purposes.
Pickup truck bed spoiler:
This attaches only to the top of the truck bed rails near the rear.
Used with a bed cover, this spoiler is intended to reduce the air profile of the steep drop-off from the tailgate.
Pickup truck cab spoiler:
This works the same as above, except focusing on the drop-off from the truck's cab to the cargo bed.
An active spoiler dynamically adjusts while the vehicle operates based on the conditions presented, changing the spoiling effect, intensity, or other performance attributes.
Found most often on sports cars and other passenger cars, the most common form is a rear spoiler that retracts and hides partially or entirely into the rear of the vehicle, then extends upwards when the vehicle exceeds a specific speed, such as the active spoiler in the Bugatti Veyron.
Active front spoilers have also been implemented on specific models, in which the front spoiler or air dam extends further toward the road below to reduce drag at high speed.
In most cases, the spoiler deployment is achieved with an electric motor controlled automatically by the onboard computer or other electronics, usually based on vehicle speed, driver setting, or other inputs.
Often, the driver can manually deploy the spoiler if desired, but may not be able to retract the spoiler above a certain speed because doing so could dangerously diminish the high-speed handling qualities of the vehicle.
Active spoilers can offer additional benefits over fixed spoilers.
Cosmetically, they can allow a cleaner or less cluttered appearance when the vehicle is parked or traveling at low speeds when it is most likely to be observed.
A spoiler that hides may be appealing to vehicle designers who are seeking to improve high-speed aerodynamics (for example, the Porsche 911 or Audi TT) without drastically changing its appearance.
Hiding a spoiler at low speeds can improve aerodynamics as well.
At low speeds, a fixed spoiler may increase drag and does little to improve the vehicle's handling due to having little airflow over it.
A retractable front spoiler can reduce the scraping of the car on curbs or other road imperfections, while still reducing drag at high speeds.
Powered fans, such as in the Chaparral 2J, do the equivalent of spoilers and increase the downforce, hence the traction and handling of the vehicle (See ground effect).
Research continues on the use of fans to alter the aerodynamics of vehicles.
Heavy trucks, like long haul tractors, may also have a spoiler on the top and sides of the cab to lessen drag caused by air resistance from the trailer it is towing, which may be taller than the cab and reduce the aerodynamics of the vehicle dramatically without the use of this spoiler.
The trailers they pull can also be fitted with under-side spoilers that angle outward to deflect passing air from the rear axle's wheels.
Trains may use spoilers to induce drag (like an air brake).
A prototype Japanese high-speed train, the Fastech 360, is designed to reach speeds of 400 kilometres per hour (250 mph).
Its nose is specifically designed to spoil a wind effect associated with passing through tunnels, and it can deploy 'ears' that slow the train in case of emergency by increasing its drag.
Some modern race cars employ a passive situational spoiler called a roof flap.
The body of the car is designed to generate downforce while driving forward.
These roof flaps deploy when the car's body is rotated to travel in reverse, a condition where the body generates lift instead.
The roof flaps deploy because they are recessed into a pocket in the roof.
The low pressure above this pocket will cause the flaps to deploy, and counteract some of the lift generated by the car, making it more resistant to coming out of contact with the ground.
These devices were introduced in 1994 in NASCAR following Rusty Wallace's crash at Talladega.
When the Porsche 911 Turbo debuted in August 1974, with large, flared, rear spoilers, they were immediately dubbed whale tails.
Designed to reduce rear-end lift and so keep the car from oversteering at high speeds, the rubber edges of the whale tail spoilers were thought to be "pedestrian friendly".
The Turbo with its whale tail became recognizable.
From 1978, the rear spoiler was redesigned and dubbed 'tea tray' because of its raised sides.
The Porsche 911 whale tails were used in conjunction with a chin spoiler attached to the front valence panel, which, according to some sources, did not enhance aerodynamic stability.
It is less effective in multiplying downforce than newer technologies like an airfoil, "rear wing running across the base of the tailgate window", or "an electronically controlled wing that deploys at about 50 mph" (80 km/h).
The whale tail came on the heels of the 1973 "duck tail" or Bürzel in German (as a part of the E-program), a smaller and less flared rear-spoiler fitted to 911 Carrera RS (meaning Rennsport or race sport in German), optional outside Germany.
The whale tail was originally designed for Porsche 930 and Porsche 935 race cars in 1973, and introduced to the Turbo in 1974 (as a part of the H-program); it was also an option on non-turbo Carreras from 1975.
Both types of spoilers were designed while Dr. Ernst Fuhrmann was serving as the Technical Director of Porsche AG.
In 1976, a rubber front chin spoiler was also introduced to offset the more effective spoiler.
By 1978, Porsche introduced another design for the rear spoiler, the "teatray", a boxier enclosure which accommodated the intercooler, and was also an option for the 911SC.
The whale tail car spoilers of the Porsche 911 caught on as a fashion statement, and the term has been used to refer to large rear spoilers on a number of automobiles, including Ford Sierra RS, Focus, Chevrolet Camaro, and Saab 900.
Whale tail spoilers also appear at the rear of tricycles, trucks, boats, and other vehicles.
A speedometer or speed meter is a gauge that measures and displays the instantaneous speed of a vehicle.
Now universally fitted to motor vehicles, they started to be available as options in the early 20th century, and as standard equipment from about 1910 onwards.
Other vehicles may use devices analogous to the speedometer with different means of sensing speed, eg. boats use a pit log, while aircraft use an airspeed indicator.
Charles Babbage is credited with creating an early type of a speedometer, which was usually fitted to locomotives.
The electric speedometer was invented by the Croat Josip Belušić in 1888 and was originally called a velocimeter.
The speedometer was originally patented by Josip Belušić (Giuseppe Bellussich) in 1888.
He presented his invention at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris.
His invention had a pointer and a magnet, using electricity to work.
German inventor Otto Schultze patented his version (which, like Belušić's, ran on eddy currents) on 7 October 1902.
Many speedometers use a rotating flexible cable driven by gearing linked to the vehicle's transmission.
The early Volkswagen Beetle and many motorcycles, however, use a cable driven from a front wheel.
This was followed by the Chronometric speedometer where the distance traveled was measured over a precise interval of time (Some Smiths speedometers used 3/4 of a second) measured by an escapement.
This was transferred to the speedometer pointer.
The chronometric speedometer is tolerant of vibration and was used in motorcycles up to the 1970s.
When the vehicle is in motion, a speedometer gear assembly turns a speedometer cable, which then turns the speedometer mechanism itself.
A small permanent magnet affixed to the speedometer cable interacts with a small aluminium cup (called a speedcup) attached to the shaft of the pointer on the analogue speedometer instrument.
As the magnet rotates near the cup, the changing magnetic field produces eddy current in the cup, which itself produces another magnetic field.
The effect is that the magnet exerts a torque on the cup, "dragging" it, and thus the speedometer pointer, in the direction of its rotation with no mechanical connection between them.
The pointer shaft is held toward zero by a fine torsion spring.
The torque on the cup increases with the speed of rotation of the magnet.
Thus an increase in the speed of the car will twist the cup and speedometer pointer against the spring.
The cup and pointer will turn until the torque of the eddy currents on the cup are balanced by the opposing torque of the spring, and then stop.
Given the torque on the cup is proportional to the car's speed, and the spring's deflection is proportional to the torque, the angle of the pointer is also proportional to the speed, so that equally spaced markers on the dial can be used for gaps in speed.
At a given speed, the pointer will remain motionless and point to the appropriate number on the speedometer's dial.
The return spring is calibrated such that a given revolution speed of the cable corresponds to a specific speed indication on the speedometer.
This calibration must take into account several factors, including ratios of the tail shaft gears that drive the flexible cable, the final drive ratio in the differential, and the diameter of the driven tires.
One of the key disadvantages of the eddy current speedometer is that it cannot show the vehicle speed when running in reverse gear since the cup would turn in the opposite direction – in this scenario, the needle would be driven against its mechanical stop pin on the zero position.
Many modern speedometers are electronic.
In designs derived from earlier eddy-current models, a rotation sensor mounted in the transmission delivers a series of electronic pulses whose frequency corresponds to the (average) rotational speed of the driveshaft, and therefore the vehicle's speed, assuming the wheels have full traction.
The sensor is typically a set of one or more magnets mounted on the output shaft or (in transaxles) differential crown wheel, or a toothed metal disk positioned between a magnet and a magnetic field sensor.
As the part in question turns, the magnets or teeth pass beneath the sensor, each time producing a pulse in the sensor as they affect the strength of the magnetic field it is measuring.
Alternatively, particularly in vehicles with multiplex wiring, some manufacturers use the pulses coming from the ABS wheel sensors which communicate to the instrument panel via the CAN Bus.
Most modern electronic speedometers have the additional ability over the eddy current type to show the vehicle's speed when moving in reverse gear.
A computer converts the pulses to a speed and displays this speed on an electronically controlled, analogue-style needle or a digital display.
Pulse information is also used for a variety of other purposes by the ECU or full-vehicle control system, e.g. triggering ABS or traction control, calculating average trip speed, or increment the odometer in place of it being turned directly by the speedometer cable.
Another early form of electronic speedometer relies upon the interaction between a precision watch mechanism and a mechanical pulsator driven by the car's wheel or transmission.
The watch mechanism endeavours to push the speedometer pointer toward zero, while the vehicle-driven pulsator tries to push it toward infinity.
The position of the speedometer pointer reflects the relative magnitudes of the outputs of the two mechanisms.
A virtual speedometer is a computer-generated tool that displays the current speed of a vehicle or object.
The virtual speedometer typically calculates the object's speed based on the distance it travels over time.
Such speedometers are programmed using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
The program uses the mobile device's GPS module.
Consistent use of the GPS module on mobile devices can result in faster battery drain.
Furthermore, virtual speedometers calculate speed by measuring the distance and time between two points using GPS signals.
However, various environmental factors such as weather conditions, terrain, and obstructions can interfere with the accuracy of these signals and result in inaccurate speed readings.
Typical bicycle speedometers measure the time between each wheel revolution and give a readout on a small, handlebar-mounted digital display.
The sensor is mounted on the bike at a fixed location, pulsing when the spoke-mounted magnet passes by.
In this way, it is analogous to an electronic car speedometer using pulses from an ABS sensor, but with a much cruder time/distance resolution – typically one pulse/display update per revolution, or as seldom as once every 2–3 seconds at low speed with a 26-inch (660 mm) wheel.
However, this is rarely a critical problem, and the system provides frequent updates at higher road speeds where the information is of more importance.
The low pulse frequency also has little impact on measurement accuracy, as these digital devices can be programmed by wheel size, or additionally by wheel or tire circumference to make distance measurements more accurate and precise than a typical motor vehicle gauge.
However, these devices carry some minor disadvantages in requiring power from batteries that must be replaced every so often in the receiver (and sensor, for wireless models), and, in wired models, the signal is carried by a thin cable that is much less robust than that used for brakes, gears, or cabled speedometers.
Other, usually older bicycle speedometers are cable driven from one or other wheel, as in the motorcycle speedometers described above.
These do not require battery power, but can be relatively bulky and heavy, and may be less accurate.
The turning force at the wheel may be provided either from a gearing system at the hub (making use of the presence of e.g. a hub brake, cylinder gear, or dynamo) as per a typical motorcycle, or with a friction wheel device that pushes against the outer edge of the rim (same position as rim brakes, but on the opposite edge of the fork) or the sidewall of the tire itself.
The former type is quite reliable and low maintenance but needs a gauge and hub gearing properly matched to the rim and tire size, whereas the latter requires little or no calibration for a moderately accurate readout (with standard tires, the "distance" covered in each wheel rotation by a friction wheel set against the rim should scale fairly linearly with wheel size, almost as if it were rolling along the ground itself) but are unsuitable for off-road use, and must be kept properly tensioned and clean of road dirt to avoid slipping or jamming.
Nearly all tires now have their size is shown as "T/A_W" on the side of the tire (See: Tire code), and the tires.
For example, a standard tire is "185/70R14" with diameter = 2*185*(70/100)+(14*25.4)
= 614.6 mm (185x70/1270 + 14 = 24.20 in).
Another is "195/50R15" with 2*195*(50/100)+(15*25.4) = 576.0 mm (195x50/1270 + 15 = 22.68 in).
Replacing the first tire (and wheels) with the second (on 15" = 381 mm wheels), a speedometer reads 100 * ((614.6/576) - 1) =
100 * (24.20/22.68 - 1) = 6.7% higher than the actual speed.
At an actual speed of 100 km/h (60 mph), the speedometer will indicate 100 x 1.067 = 106.7 km/h (60 * 1.067 = 64.02 mph), approximately.
In the case of wear, a new "185/70R14" tire of 620 mm (24.4 inch) diameter will have ≈8 mm tread depth, at legal limit this reduces to 1.6 mm, the difference being 12.8 mm in diameter or 0.5 inches which is 2% in 620 mm (24.4 inches).
In many countries the legislated error in speedometer readings is ultimately governed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Regulation 39, which covers those aspects of vehicle type approval that relate to speedometers.
The main purpose of the UNECE regulations is to facilitate trade in motor vehicles by agreeing on uniform type approval standards rather than requiring a vehicle model to undergo different approval processes in each country where it is sold.
The indicated speed must never be less than the actual speed, i.e. it should not be possible to inadvertently speed because of an incorrect speedometer reading.
The indicated speed must not be more than 110 percent of the true speed plus 4 km/h (2.5 mph) at specified test speeds.
For example, at 80 km/h (50 mph), the indicated speed must be no more than 92 km/h (57 mph).
The standards specify both the limits on accuracy and many of the details of how it should be measured during the approvals process.
For example, the test measurements should be made (for most vehicles) at 40, 80 and 120 km/h (25, 50 and 75 mph), and at a particular ambient temperature and road surface.
There are slight differences between the different standards, for example in the minimum accuracy of the equipment measuring the true speed of the vehicle.
The UNECE regulation relaxes the requirements for vehicles mass-produced following type approval.
At Conformity of Production Audits the upper limit on indicated speed is increased to 110 percent plus 6 km/h (3.7 mph) for cars, buses, trucks, and similar vehicles, and 110 percent plus 8 km/h (5.0 mph) for two- or three-wheeled vehicles that have a maximum speed above 50 km/h (31 mph) (or a cylinder capacity, if powered by a heat engine, of more than 50 cm3 (3.1 cu in)).
European Union Directive 2000/7/EC, which relates to two- and three-wheeled vehicles, provides similar slightly relaxed limits in production.
There were no Australian Design Rules in place for speedometers in Australia before July 1988.
They had to be introduced when speed cameras were first used.
This means there are no legally accurate speedometers for these older vehicles.
All vehicles manufactured on or after 1 July 2007, and all models of vehicle introduced on or after 1 July 2006, must conform to UNECE Regulation 39.
All vehicles manufactured in Australia or imported for supply to the Australian market must comply with the Australian Design Rules.
The state and territory governments may set policies for the tolerance of speed over the posted speed limits that may be lower than the 10% in the earlier versions of the Australian Design Rules permitted, such as in Victoria.
This has caused some controversy since it would be possible for a driver to be unaware that they are speeding should their vehicle be fitted with an under-reading speedometer.
The amended Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 permits the use of speedometers that meet either the requirements of EC Council Directive 75/443 (as amended by Directive 97/39) or UNECE Regulation 39.
The Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2001 permits single vehicles to be approved.
As with the UNECE regulation and the EC Directives, the speedometer must never show an indicated speed less than the actual speed.
However, it differs slightly from them in specifying that for all actual speeds between 25 mph and 70 mph (or the vehicles' maximum speed if it is lower than this), the indicated speed must not exceed 110% of the actual speed, plus 6.25 mph.
For example, if the vehicle is actually traveling at 50 mph, the speedometer must not show more than 61.25 mph or less than 50 mph.
Federal standards in the United States allow a maximum 5 mph error at a speed of 50 mph on speedometer readings for commercial vehicles.
Aftermarket modifications, such as different tire and wheel sizes or different differential gearing, can cause speedometer inaccuracy.
Starting with U.S. automobiles manufactured on or after 1 September 1979, the NHTSA required speedometers to have a special emphasis on 55 mph (90 km/h) and display no more than a maximum speed of 85 mph (136 km/h).
On 25 March 1982, the NHTSA revoked the rule because no "significant safety benefits" could come from maintaining the standard.
The first and simpler method is based on how far the receiver has moved since the last measurement.
Such speed calculations are not subject to the same sources of error as the vehicle's speedometer (wheel size, transmission/drive ratios).
Instead, the GPS's positional accuracy, and therefore the accuracy of its calculated speed, is dependent on the satellite signal quality at the time.
Speed calculations will be more accurate at higher speeds when the ratio of positional error to positional change is lower.
The GPS software may also use a moving average calculation to reduce error.
Some GPS devices do not take into account the vertical position of the car so will under-report the speed by the road's gradient.
Alternatively, the GPS may take advantage of the Doppler effect to estimate its velocity.
In ideal conditions, the accuracy for commercial devices is within 0.2–0.5 km/h, but it may worsen if the signal quality degrades.
As mentioned in the satnav article, GPS data has been used to overturn a speeding ticket; the GPS logs showed the defendant traveling below the speed limit when they were ticketed.
That the data came from a GPS device was likely less important than the fact that it was logged; logs from the vehicle's speedometer could likely have been used instead, had they existed.
Starter ring gears are attached to either the flywheel or the flexplate of an engine.
The teeth of the ring gear are driven by the smaller gear (known as the pinion) of the starter motor.
The pinion engages the starter ring only during starting and once the engine is running the pinion withdraws.
The starter ring gear is most commonly made by forming a length of square or rectangular steel bar into a circle and welding the ends together.
This ring is then machined to create flat surfaces of the required inner and outer diameters.
The gear teeth are then created using a hobbing tool, followed by processes to chamfer, deburr and clean the gear teeth.
In cars with a manual transmission, the starter ring gear is fitted to the outer diameter of the flywheel.
The ring gear is usually fixed to the flywheel through use of an interference fit, which is achieved by heating the ring gear and so that thermal expansion allows it to be placed around the flywheel.
In cars with an automatic transmission, the starter ring gear is usually welded to the outside of the flexplate.
A common exhortation in health pop culture is "Take the stairs, not the elevator".
In one study based on mean oxygen uptake and heart rate, researchers estimated that ascending a 15 cm (5.9 inches) step expends 0.46 kJ (0.11 kcal) for the average person, and descending a step expends 0.21 kJ (0.05 kcal).
The study concluded that stair-climbing met the minimum requirements for cardiorespiratory benefits, and considered stair-climbing suitable for promotion of physical activity.
Stair climbing has developed into the organized sport tower running.
Every year several stair climbing races are held around the world with the competitors running up the stairs of some of the world's tallest buildings and towers (e.g., the Empire State Building, Gran Hotel Bali), or on outside stairs such as the Niesenbahn Stairway.
World class athletes from the running and cycling worlds regularly compete in such events.
Some have specialized exclusively in stair climbing races.
Prizes, awards, and other accolades are given for the top performers by gender and age group.
Stair climbing is one of the most grueling of sports, requiring competitors to move their entire body weight vertically, as well as horizontally.
The results of more than 160 races on all continents are evaluated each year for the Towerrunning World Cup.
The most important - about 18 so called "Masters Races" - have a predefined factor of 1.5 to 2.5, whereas all other races are given 0.4, 0.7 or 1 depending on class and internationality of the participants.
2010 World Cup winners were Melissa Moon (NZL) and Thomas Dold (GER).
2011 winners are Dold (3rd time) and Cristina Bonacina (ITA).
The World Cup Final 2012 was hosted on December 8 in Bogota (COL).
An annual competition, 'Girnar Arohan Spardha', is held in Junagadh, India, and involves a race to climb and descend the steps of the Girnar mountain.
The Ocho has a televised event called "Slippery Stairs".
Falling down a flight of stairs or just a couple of steps is very common during infants’ first exposure to stair descent.
Infants are more likely to fall down stairs than any other age group.
In the United States, approximately 73,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years have reported injury on stairs or steps in 2009.
Stair descent involves perceptual, cognitive and motor abilities.
It relies heavily on visual information to enable balance and accuracy.
Seeing obstacles ahead helps stair descent, but for infants the action of keeping their heavy head balanced enough to look down at their feet and the objective together, make the process very difficult.
(Hurlke, 1998).
Not seeing the task ahead causes confusion and disrupts concentration.
Scooting: where the infant sits on the step and thrusts forward using their bottom to land on the next step.
Backing: where the infant turns around (to counter the motion of climbing), and slowly lowers one foot at a time to descend to the lower step.
Backing distributes the weight evenly on all four limbs, but means that the child cannot see what it is doing.
Walking: where a child descends in an upright position facing the bottom of the staircase, lowering one foot at a time to the next step.
Some limited norms for stair climbing motor milestones have been established, but the process had historically been viewed like any other motor milestone - as a universal skill acquired through development.
One study looked at the typical age onset for stair ascent and descent, and compared them to other developmental milestones.
It also looked at the stair climbing strategies that infants use.
Consisting of 732 infants, and including parental assessment and documentation of motor skill achievements, along with in-depth interviews parents about the strategies involved and child assessment using laboratory stair apparatus.
The results showed that children younger than 9 months of age were unable to go up or down stairs at all, or were only able to go up.
By around 13 months, most infants could go upstairs and about half could ascend and descend stairs.
Infants typically learned to descend stairs after they have already learned to ascend, with only about 12% achieved both stair-climbing skills at the same time.
On average in this study, infants learned to crawl and cruise before learning to ascend stairs independently.
Infants were able to climb up the stairs before they could walk, but walking tended to come before independent stair descent.
While most of the infants had prior stair experience, the presence or absence of stairs in the home did not influence the onsets of crawling, cruising or stair descent.
However, lack of exposure to stairs resulted in a significant time-lag between first learning to ascend and to descend.
Differences in housing types created a so-called 'suburban advantage' (i.e. houses with stairs versus flats/apartments without).
Sliding backwards feet first is the safest approach to descending stairs due to the fact that the midline of the body is closer to the staircase providing an even weight distribution on all four limbs.
This might explain why it is exceptionally difficult for older people to descend stairs, because their midline is so far way due to longer arms and legs.
Other research suggests that infants’ descent strategies may be related to their cognitive abilities.
This is why most parents teach their children to back down stairs, even though it's the safest it is also the most cognitively difficult descent strategy.
On 28 September 2014, Christian Riedl climbed Tower 185 in Frankfurt, Germany 71 times in 12 hours for a total of 43,128 ft (13.14 km).
From 5–6 October 2007, Kurt Hess climbed Esterli Tower in Switzerland 413 times in less than 24 hours for a total of 60,974 ft (18.585 km).
A spark plug (sometimes, in British English, a sparking plug, and, colloquially, a plug) is a device for delivering electric current from an ignition system to the combustion chamber of a spark-ignition engine to ignite the compressed fuel/air mixture by an electric spark, while containing combustion pressure within the engine.
A spark plug has a metal threaded shell, electrically isolated from a central electrode by a ceramic insulator.
The central electrode, which may contain a resistor, is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an ignition coil or magneto.
The spark plug's metal shell is screwed into the engine's cylinder head and thus electrically grounded.
The central electrode protrudes through the porcelain insulator into the combustion chamber, forming one or more spark gaps between the inner end of the central electrode and usually one or more protuberances or structures attached to the inner end of the threaded shell and designated the side, earth, or ground electrode(s).
Spark plugs may also be used for other purposes; in Saab Direct Ignition when they are not firing, spark plugs are used to measure ionization in the cylinders – this ionic current measurement is used to replace the ordinary cam phase sensor, knock sensor and misfire measurement function.
Spark plugs may also be used in other applications such as furnaces wherein a combustible fuel/air mixture must be ignited.
In this case, they are sometimes referred to as flame igniters.
In 1860 Étienne Lenoir (credit is also given to Edmond Berger, who invented but never patented the spark plug on February 2, 1839) used an electric spark plug in his gas engine, the first internal combustion piston engine.
Lenoir is generally credited with the invention of the spark plug.
Early patents for spark plugs included those by Nikola Tesla (in U.S. patent 609,250 for an ignition timing system, 1898), Frederick Richard Simms (GB 24859/1898, 1898) and Robert Bosch (GB 26907/1898).
Only the invention of the first commercially viable high-voltage spark plug as part of a magneto-based ignition system by Robert Bosch's engineer Gottlob Honold in 1902 made possible the development of the spark-ignition engine.
Subsequent manufacturing improvements can be credited to Albert Champion, to the Lodge brothers, sons of Sir Oliver Lodge, who developed and manufactured their father's idea and also to Kenelm Lee Guinness, of the Guinness brewing family, who developed the KLG brand.
Helen Blair Bartlett played a vital role in making the insulator in 1930.
The function of a spark plug is to produce a spark at the required time to ignite the combustible mixture.
The plug is connected to the high voltage generated by an ignition coil or magneto.
As current flows from the coil, a voltage develops between the central and side electrodes.
Initially no current can flow because the fuel and air in the gap is an insulator, but as the voltage rises further it begins to change the structure of the gases between the electrodes.
Once the voltage exceeds the dielectric strength of the gases, the gases become ionized.
The ionized gas becomes a conductor and allows current to flow across the gap.
Spark plugs usually require voltage of 12,000–25,000 volts or more to "fire" properly, although it can go up to 45,000 volts.
They supply higher current during the discharge process, resulting in a hotter and longer-duration spark.
As the current of electrons surges across the gap, it raises the temperature of the spark channel to 60,000 K. The intense heat in the spark channel causes the ionized gas to expand very quickly, like a small explosion.
This is the "click" heard when observing a spark, similar to lightning and thunder.
The heat and pressure force the gases to react with each other, and at the end of the spark event there should be a small ball of fire in the spark gap as the gases burn on their own.
The size of this fireball, or kernel, depends on the exact composition of the mixture between the electrodes and the level of combustion chamber turbulence at the time of the spark.
A small kernel will make the engine run as though the ignition timing was delayed, and a large one as though the timing was advanced.
A spark plug is composed of a shell, insulator and the central conductor.
It passes through the wall of the combustion chamber and therefore must also seal the combustion chamber against high pressures and temperatures without deteriorating over long periods of time and extended use.
Spark plugs are specified by size, either thread or nut (often referred to as Euro), sealing type (taper or crush washer), and spark gap.
Common thread (nut) sizes in Europe are 10 mm (16 mm), 14 mm (21 mm; sometimes, 16 mm), and 18 mm (24 mm, sometimes, 21 mm).
In the United States, common thread (nut) sizes are 10mm (16mm), 12mm (14mm, 16mm or 17.5mm), 14mm (16mm, 20.63mm) and 18mm (20.63mm).
The top of the spark plug contains a terminal to connect to the ignition system.
Over of the years variations in the terminal configuration have been introduced by manufacturers.
The exact terminal construction varies depending on the use of the spark plug.
Most passenger car spark plug wires snap onto the terminal of the plug, but some wires have eyelet connectors which are fastened onto the plug under a nut.
The standard solid non-removable nut SAE configuration is common for many cars and trucks.
Plugs which are used for these applications often have the end of the terminal serve a double purpose as the nut on a thin threaded shaft so that they can be used for either type of connection.
This type of spark plug has a removable nut or knurl, which enables its users to attach them to two different kinds of spark plug boots.
Some spark plugs have a bare thread, which is a common type for motorcycles and ATVs.
Finally, in very recent years, a cup-style terminal has been introduced, which allows for a longer ceramic insulator in the same confined space.
The main part of the insulator is typically made from sintered alumina (Al2O3), a very hard ceramic material with high dielectric strength, printed with the manufacturer's name and identifying marks, then glazed to improve resistance to surface spark tracking.
Its major functions are to provide mechanical support and electrical insulation for the central electrode, while also providing an extended spark path for flashover protection.
This extended portion, particularly in engines with deeply recessed plugs, helps extend the terminal above the cylinder head so as to make it more readily accessible.
A further feature of sintered alumina is its good heat conduction – reducing the tendency for the insulator to glow with heat and so light the mixture prematurely.
By lengthening the surface between the high voltage terminal and the grounded metal case of the spark plug, the physical shape of the ribs functions to improve the electrical insulation and prevent electrical energy from leaking along the insulator surface from the terminal to the metal case.
The disrupted and longer path makes the electricity encounter more resistance along the surface of the spark plug even in the presence of dirt and moisture.
Some spark plugs are manufactured without ribs; improvements in the dielectric strength of the insulator make them less important.
On modern (post 1930s) spark plugs, the tip of the insulator protruding into the combustion chamber is the same sintered aluminium oxide (alumina) ceramic as the upper portion, merely unglazed.
It is designed to withstand 650 °C (1,200 °F) and 60 kV. Older spark plugs, particularly in aircraft, used an insulator made of stacked layers of mica, compressed by tension in the centre electrode.
With the development of leaded petrol in the 1930s, lead deposits on the mica became a problem and reduced the interval between needing to clean the spark plug.
Sintered alumina was developed by Siemens in Germany to counteract this.
Sintered alumina is a superior material to mica or porcelain because it is a relatively good thermal conductor for a ceramic, it maintains good mechanical strength and (thermal) shock resistance at higher temperatures, and this ability to run hot allows it to be run at "self cleaning" temperatures without rapid degradation.
It also allows a simple single piece construction at low cost but high mechanical reliability.
The dimensions of the insulator and the metal conductor core determine the heat range of the plug.
Short insulators are usually "cooler" plugs, while "hotter" plugs are made with a lengthened path to the metal body, though this also depends on the thermally conductive metal core.
Because the spark plug also seals the combustion chamber of the engine when installed, seals are required to ensure there is no leakage from the combustion chamber.
The internal seals of modern plugs are made of compressed glass/metal powder, but old style seals were typically made by the use of a multi-layer braze.
The external seal is usually a crush washer, but some manufacturers use the cheaper method of a taper interface and simple compression to attempt sealing.
The metal case/shell (or the jacket, as many people call it) of the spark plug withstands the torque of tightening the plug, serves to remove heat from the insulator and pass it on to the cylinder head, and acts as the ground for the sparks passing through the central electrode to the side electrode.
Spark plug threads are cold rolled to prevent thermal cycle fatigue.
It's important to install spark plugs with the correct "reach," or thread length.
Spark plugs can vary in reach from 0.095 to 2.649 cm (0.0375 to 1.043 in), such for automotive and small engine applications.
Also, a marine spark plug's shell is double-dipped, zinc-chromate coated metal.
In the late 1970s, the development of engines reached a stage where the heat range of conventional spark plugs with solid nickel alloy centre electrodes was unable to cope with their demands.
A plug that was cold enough to cope with the demands of high speed driving would not be able to burn off the carbon deposits caused by stop–start urban conditions, and would foul in these conditions, making the engine misfire.
Similarly, a plug that was hot enough to run smoothly in town could melt when called upon to cope with extended high speed running on motorways.
The answer to this problem, devised by the spark plug manufacturers, was to use a different material and design for the centre electrode that would be able to carry the heat of combustion away from the tip more effectively than a solid nickel alloy could.
Copper was the material chosen for the task and a method for manufacturing the copper-cored centre electrode was created by Floform.
The central electrode is usually the one designed to eject the electrons (the cathode, i.e. negative polarity relative to the engine block) because it is normally the hottest part of the plug; it is easier to emit electrons from a hot surface, because of the same physical laws that increase emissions of vapor from hot surfaces (see thermionic emission).
In addition, electrons are emitted where the electrical field strength is greatest; this is from wherever the radius of curvature of the surface is smallest, from a sharp point or edge rather than a flat surface (see corona discharge).
Using the colder, blunter side electrode as negative requires up to 45 percent higher voltage, so few ignition systems aside from wasted spark are designed this way.
Waste spark systems place a greater strain upon spark plugs since they alternately fire electrons in both directions (from the ground electrode to the central electrode, not just from the central electrode to the ground electrode).
As a result, vehicles with such a system should have precious metals on both electrodes, not just on the central electrode, in order to increase service replacement intervals since they wear down the metal more quickly in both directions, not just one.
It would be easiest to pull electrons from a pointed electrode but a pointed electrode would erode after only a few seconds.
Instead, the electrons emit from the sharp edges of the end of the electrode; as these edges erode, the spark becomes weaker and less reliable.
cleaning with tools such as a wire brush leaves traces of metal on the insulator which can provide a weak conduction path and thus weaken the spark (increasing emissions).
plugs are so cheap relative to labor cost, economics dictate replacement, particularly with modern long-life plugs.
iridium and platinum plugs that have longer lifetimes than copper have become more common.
The development of noble metal high temperature electrodes (using metals such as yttrium, iridium, tungsten, palladium, or ruthenium, as well as the relatively high value platinum,  silver or gold) allows the use of a smaller center wire, which has sharper edges but will not melt or corrode away.
These materials are used because of their high melting points and durability, not because of their electrical conductivity (which is irrelevant in series with the plug resistor or wires).
The smaller electrode also absorbs less heat from the spark and initial flame energy.
Polonium spark plugs were marketed by Firestone from 1940 to 1953.
While the amount of radiation from the plugs was minuscule and not a threat to the consumer, the benefits of such plugs quickly diminished after approximately a month because of polonium's short half-life, and because buildup on the conductors would block the radiation that improved engine performance.
The premise behind the polonium spark plug, as well as Alfred Matthew Hubbard's prototype radium plug that preceded it, was that the radiation would improve ionization of the fuel in the cylinder and thus allow the plug to fire more quickly and efficiently.
The side electrode (also known as the "ground strap") is made from high nickel steel and is welded or hot forged to the side of the metal shell.
The side electrode also runs very hot, especially on projected nose plugs.
Some designs have provided a copper core to this electrode, so as to increase heat conduction.
Multiple side electrodes may also be used, so that they don't overlap the central electrode.
The ground electrode can also have small pads of platinum or even iridium added to them in order to increase service life.
Spark plugs are typically designed to have a spark gap which can be adjusted by the technician installing the spark plug, by bending the ground electrode slightly.
The same plug may be specified for several different engines, requiring a different gap for each.
Spark plugs in automobiles generally have a gap between 0.6 and 1.8 mm (0.024 and 0.071 in).
The gap may require adjustment from the out-of-the-box gap.
A spark plug gap gauge is a disc with a sloping edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, and is used to measure the gap.
Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on distributor points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes.
The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly.
With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark plug gauges from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars.
Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.
The gap adjustment (also called "spark plug gapping") can be crucial to proper engine operation.
A narrow gap may give too small and weak a spark to effectively ignite the fuel-air mixture, but the plug will almost always fire on each cycle.
A gap that is too wide might prevent a spark from firing at all or may misfire at high speeds, but will usually have a spark that is strong for a clean burn.
A spark which intermittently fails to ignite the fuel-air mixture may not be noticeable directly, but will show up as a reduction in the engine's power and fuel efficiency.
Gap adjustment is not recommended for iridium and platinum spark plugs, because there is a risk of damaging a metal disk welded to the electrode.
Over the years variations on the basic spark plug design have attempted to provide either better ignition, longer life, or both.
Such variations include the use of two, three, or four equally spaced ground electrodes surrounding the central electrode.
Other variations include using a recessed central electrode surrounded by the spark plug thread, which effectively becomes the ground electrode (see "surface-discharge spark plug", below).
Also there is the use of a V-shaped notch in the tip of the ground electrode.
Multiple ground electrodes generally provide longer life, as when the spark gap widens due to electric discharge wear, the spark moves to another closer ground electrode.
The disadvantage of multiple ground electrodes is that a shielding effect can occur in the engine combustion chamber inhibiting the flame face as the fuel air mixture burns.
This can result in a less efficient burn and increased fuel consumption.
They also are difficult or nearly impossible to adjust to another uniform gap size.
A piston engine has a part of the combustion chamber that is always out of reach of the piston; and this zone is where the conventional spark plug is located.
A Wankel engine has a permanently varying combustion area; and the spark plug is inevitably swept by the rotor's apex seals.
If a  spark plug were to protrude into the Wankel's combustion chamber it would be hit by the passing apex seal, but if the plug were recessed to avoid this, mixture access to the spark would be reduced, leading to misfire or incomplete combustion.
So a new type of "surface discharge" plug was developed, presenting an almost flat face to the combustion chamber.
A stubby centre electrode projects only very slightly, and the entire earthed body of the plug acts as the side electrode.
The electrodes thus sit just beyond the reach of the passing apex seal, while the spark is accessible to the fuel/air mixture.
The arc gap remains constant throughout the entire service life of a surface-gap spark plug, and the spark path will continually vary (instead of darting from the centre to the side electrode as in a conventional plug).
A further advantage of the surface-gap design is that the side electrode cannot break off and potentially cause engine damage, though this also doesn't often happen with conventional spark plugs.
Most spark plugs seal to the cylinder head with a single-use hollow or folded metal washer which is crushed slightly between the flat surface of the head and that of the plug, just above the threads.
Some spark plugs have a tapered seat that uses no washer.
The torque for installing these plugs is supposed to be lower than a washer-sealed plug.
Spark plugs with tapered seats should never be installed in vehicles with heads requiring washers, and vice versa.
Otherwise, a poor seal or incorrect reach would result because of the threads not properly seating in the heads.
The protrusion of the tip into the chamber also affects plug performance, however; the more centrally located the spark gap is, generally the better the ignition of the air-fuel mixture will be, although experts believe the process is more complex and dependent on combustion chamber shape.
On the other hand, if an engine is "burning oil", the excess oil leaking into the combustion chamber tends to foul the plug tip and inhibit the spark; in such cases, a plug with less protrusion than the engine would normally call for often collects less fouling and performs better, for a longer period.
Special "anti-fouling" adapters are sold which fit between the plug and the head to reduce the protrusion of the plug for just this reason, on older engines with severe oil burning problems; this will cause the ignition of the fuel-air mixture to be less effective, but in such cases, this is of lesser significance.
The operating temperature of a spark plug is the actual physical temperature at the tip of the spark plug within the running engine, normally between 500 and 800 °C (932 and 1,472 °F).
This is important because it determines the efficiency of plug self-cleaning and is determined by a number of factors, but primarily the actual temperature within the combustion chamber.
There is no direct relationship between the actual operating temperature of the spark plug and spark voltage.
However, the level of torque currently being produced by the engine will strongly influence spark plug operating temperature because the maximal temperature and pressure occur when the engine is operating near peak torque output (torque and rotational speed directly determine the power output).
The temperature of the insulator responds to the thermal conditions it is exposed to in the combustion chamber, but not vice versa.
If the tip of the spark plug is too hot, it can cause pre-ignition or sometimes detonation/knocking, and damage may occur.
If it is too cold, electrically conductive deposits may form on the insulator, causing a loss of spark energy or the actual shorting-out of the spark current.
A spark plug is said to be "hot" if it is a better heat insulator, keeping more heat in the tip of the spark plug.
A spark plug is said to be "cold" if it can conduct more heat out of the spark plug tip and lower the tip's temperature.
Whether a spark plug is "hot" or "cold" is known as the heat range of the spark plug.
The heat range of a spark plug is typically specified as a number, with some manufacturers using ascending numbers for hotter plugs, and others doing the opposite – using ascending numbers for colder plugs.
The heat range of a spark plug is affected by the construction of the spark plug: the types of materials used, the length of insulator and the surface area of the plug exposed within the combustion chamber.
For normal use, the selection of a spark plug heat range is a balance between keeping the tip hot enough at idle to prevent fouling and cold enough at maximal power to prevent pre-ignition or engine knocking.
By examining "hotter" and "cooler" spark plugs of the same manufacturer side by side, the principle involved can be very clearly seen; the cooler plugs have a more substantial ceramic insulator filling the gap between the center electrode and the shell, effectively allowing more heat to be carried off by the shell, while the hotter plugs have less ceramic material, so that the tip is more isolated from the body of the plug and retains heat better.
Heat from the combustion chamber escapes through the exhaust gases, the side walls of the cylinder and the spark plug itself.
The heat range of a spark plug has only a minute effect on combustion chamber and overall engine temperature.
A cold plug will not materially cool down an engine's running temperature.
(A too hot plug may, however, indirectly lead to a runaway pre-ignition condition that can increase engine temperature.)
Rather, the main effect of a "hot" or "cold" plug is to affect the temperature of the tip of the spark plug.
It was common before the modern era of computerized fuel injection to specify at least a couple of different heat ranges for plugs for an automobile engine; a hotter plug for cars that were mostly driven slowly around the city, and a colder plug for sustained high-speed highway use.
This practice has, however, largely become obsolete now that cars' fuel/air mixtures and cylinder temperatures are maintained within a narrow range, for purposes of limiting emissions.
Racing engines, however, still benefit from picking a proper plug heat range.
Very old racing engines will sometimes have two sets of plugs, one just for starting and another to be installed for driving once the engine is warmed up.
Spark plug manufacturers use different numbers to denote heat range of their spark plugs.
Some manufacturers, such as Denso and NGK, have numbers that become higher as they get colder.
By contrast, Champion, Bosch, BRISK, Beru, and ACDelco use a heat range system in which the numbers become bigger as the plugs get hotter.
As a result, heat range numbers need to be translated between the different manufacturers and cannot be casually interchanged as equals.
The spark plug's firing end will be affected by the internal environment of the combustion chamber.
As the spark plug can be removed for inspection, the effects of combustion on the plug can be examined.
An examination, or "reading" of the characteristic markings on the firing end of the spark plug can indicate conditions within the running engine.
Engine and spark plug manufacturers will publish information about the characteristic markings in spark plug reading charts.
A light brownish discoloration of the tip of the block indicates proper operation; other conditions may indicate malfunction.
For example, a sandblasted look to the tip of the spark plug means persistent, light detonation is occurring, often unheard.
The damage that is occurring to the tip of the spark plug is also occurring on the inside of the cylinder.
Heavy detonation can cause outright breakage of the spark plug insulator and internal engine parts before appearing as sandblasted erosion but is easily heard.
As another example, if the plug is too cold, there will be deposits on the nose of the plug.
Conversely if the plug is too hot, the porcelain will be porous looking, almost like sugar.
The material which seals the central electrode to the insulator will boil out.
Sometimes the end of the plug will appear glazed, as the deposits have melted.
An idling engine will have a different impact on the spark plugs than one running at full throttle.
Spark plug readings are only valid for the most recent engine operating conditions and running the engine under different conditions may erase or obscure characteristic marks previously left on the spark plugs.
The most valuable information is gathered by running the engine at high speed and full load, immediately cutting the ignition off and stopping without idling or low speed operation and removing the plugs for reading.
Spark plug reading viewers, which are simply combined flashlight/magnifiers, are available to improve the reading of the spark plugs.
"Indexing" of plugs upon installation involves installing the spark plug so that the open area of its gap, not shrouded by the ground electrode, faces the center of the combustion chamber rather than one of its walls.
The theory holds that this will maximize the exposure of the fuel-air mixture to the spark, also ensuring that every combustion chamber is even in layout and therefore resulting in better ignition.
Indexing is accomplished by marking the location of the gap on the outside of the plug, installing it, and noting the direction in which the mark faces.
Then the plug is removed and washers are added to change the orientation of the tightened plug.
This must be done individually for each plug, as the orientation of the gap with respect to the threads of the shell is random.
Some plugs are made with a non-random orientation of the gap and are usually marked as such by a suffix to the model number; typically these are specified by manufacturers of very small engines where the spark plug tip and electrodes form a significantly large part of the shape of the combustion chamber.
The Honda Insight has indexed spark plugs from factory, with four different part numbers available corresponding to the different degrees of indexing to achieve most efficient combustion and maximal fuel efficiency.
Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar power to generate electricity, solar thermal energy (including solar water heating), and solar architecture.
It is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power.
Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy.
Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.
In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits.
It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible, and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating global warming ....
these advantages are global".
The Earth receives 174 petawatts (PW) of incoming solar radiation (insolation) at the upper atmosphere.
Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest, 122 PW, is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses.
The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet.
Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m2, or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m2 per day.
Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere.
Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection.
When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle.
The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anticyclones.
Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C.
By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.
The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land masses is approximately 122 PW·year = 3,850,000 exajoules (EJ) per year.
In 2002 (2019), this was more energy in one hour (one hour and 25 minutes) than the world used in one year.
Photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000 EJ per year in biomass.
The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.
In 2021, Carbon Tracker Initiative estimated the land area needed to generate all our energy from solar alone was 450,000 km2 — or about the same as the area of Sweden, or the area of Morocco, or the area of California (0.3% of the Earth's total land area).
Solar technologies are categorized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on the distance from the Equator.
Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends, all types of renewable energy, other than geothermal power and tidal power, are derived either directly or indirectly from the Sun.
Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar thermal collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful output.
Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun.
Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternative resources and are generally considered demand-side technologies.
In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and World Energy Council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year.
This took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans.
It was stated that solar energy has a global potential of 1,600 to 49,800 exajoules (4.4×1014 to 1.4×1016 kWh) per year (see table below).
Solar thermal technologies can be used for water heating, space heating, space cooling and process heat generation.
In 1878, at the Universal Exposition in Paris, Augustin Mouchot successfully demonstrated a solar steam engine but could not continue development because of cheap coal and other factors.
In 1897, Frank Shuman, a US inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine.
In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants.
He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether.
Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.
We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the Sun.
Solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water.
In middle geographical latitudes (between 40 degrees north and 40 degrees south), 60 to 70% of the domestic hot water use, with water temperatures up to 60 °C (140 °F), can be provided by solar heating systems.
The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors (44%) and glazed flat plate collectors (34%) generally used for domestic hot water; and unglazed plastic collectors (21%) used mainly to heat swimming pools.
As of 2015, the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems was approximately 436 thermal gigawatt (GWth), and China is the world leader in their deployment with 309 GWth installed, taken up 71% of the market.
Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90% of homes using them.
In the United States, Canada, and Australia, heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of 18 GWth as of 2005.
In the United States, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for 30% (4.65 EJ/yr) of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly 50% (10.1 EJ/yr) of the energy used in residential buildings.
Solar heating, cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy.
Use of solar for heating can roughly be divided into passive solar concepts and active solar concepts, depending on whether active elements such as sun tracking and solar concentrator optics are used.
Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy.
Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement, and water.
Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night.
However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well.
The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting, and shading conditions.
When duly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.
A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building.
As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated, causing an updraft that pulls air through the building.
Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials in a way that mimics greenhouses.
Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling.
When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter.
Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating.
In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability.
They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.
Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying, and pasteurization.
They can be grouped into three broad categories: box cookers, panel cookers, and reflector cookers.
The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by Horace de Saussure in 1767.
A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid.
It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90–150 °C (194–302 °F).
Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers.
Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors) to focus light on a cooking container.
These cookers reach temperatures of 315 °C (599 °F) and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun.
Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas.
In some states of the United States legislation protects the "right to dry" clothes.
Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air.
UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 °C (40 °F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45–60 °C (113–140 °F).
The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12 years) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems.
As of 2003, over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres (380,000 sq ft) had been installed worldwide, including an 860 m2 (9,300 sq ft) collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300 m2 (14,000 sq ft) collector in Coimbatore, India, used for drying marigolds.
Solar distillation can be used to make saline or brackish water potable.
The first recorded instance of this was by 16th-century Arab alchemists.
A large-scale solar distillation project was first constructed in 1872 in the Chilean mining town of Las Salinas.
The plant, which had solar collection area of 4,700 m2 (51,000 sq ft), could produce up to 22,700 L (5,000 imp gal; 6,000 US gal) per day and operate for 40 years.
Individual still designs include single-slope, double-slope (or greenhouse type), vertical, conical, inverted absorber, multi-wick, and multiple effect.
These stills can operate in passive, active, or hybrid modes.
Double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes, while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications.
Solar water disinfection (SODIS) involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours.
Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions.
It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage.
Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.
Solar energy may be used in a water stabilization pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity.
A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable.
Molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night.
It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995 to 1999.
The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity.
The molten salt mixtures vary.
The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate.
It is non-flammable and non-toxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid.
Hence, experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.
The salt melts at 131 °C (268 °F).
It is kept liquid at 288 °C (550 °F) in an insulated "cold" storage tank.
The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused irradiance heats it to 566 °C (1,051 °F).
It is then sent to a hot storage tank.
This is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week.
When electricity is needed, the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce superheated steam for a turbine/generator as used in any conventional coal, oil, or nuclear power plant.
A 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank about 9.1 metres (30 ft) tall and 24 metres (79 ft) in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design.
Several parabolic trough power plants in Spain and solar power tower developer SolarReserve use this thermal energy storage concept.
The Solana Generating Station in the U.S. has six hours of storage by molten salt.
In Chile, The Cerro Dominador power plant has a 110 MW solar-thermal tower, the heat is transferred to molten salts.
The molten salts then transfer their heat in a heat exchanger to water, generating superheated steam, which feeds a turbine that transforms the kinetic energy of the steam into electric energy using the Rankine cycle.
In this way, the Cerro Dominador plant is capable of generating around 110 MW of power.
The plant has an advanced storage system enabling it to generate electricity for up to 17.5 hours without direct solar radiation, which allows it to provide a stable electricity supply without interruptions if required.
The Project secured up to 950 GW·h per year sale.
Another project is the María Elena plant  is a 400 MW thermo-solar complex in the northern Chilean region of Antofagasta employing molten salt technology.
Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam.
The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant.
A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the solar tower collectors, the concentrating linear Fresnel reflector, and the Stirling dish.
Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light.
In all of these systems, a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.
Designs need to account for the risk of a dust storm, hail, or another extreme weather event that can damage the fine glass surfaces of solar power plants.
Metal grills would allow a high percentage of sunlight to enter the mirrors and solar panels while also preventing most damage.
Sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history.
Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the Greeks and Chinese, who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth.
The common features of passive solar architecture are orientation relative to the Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass.
When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment, they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range.
Socrates' Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design.
The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package.
Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans, and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.
Urban heat islands (UHI) are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment.
The higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment.
A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white and to plant trees in the area.
Using these methods, a hypothetical "cool communities" program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3 °C at an estimated cost of US$1  billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US$530  million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings.
Agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy to optimize the productivity of plants.
Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields.
While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture.
During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy.
These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm.
Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight.
In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun.
Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure.
More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.
Greenhouses convert solar light to heat, enabling year-round production and the growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate.
Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius.
The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad.
Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today.
Plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers.
Development of a solar-powered car has been an engineering goal since the 1980s.
The World Solar Challenge is a biannual solar-powered car race, where teams from universities and enterprises compete over 3,021 kilometres (1,877 mi) across central Australia from Darwin to Adelaide.
In 1987, when it was founded, the winner's average speed was 67 kilometres per hour (42 mph) and by 2007 the winner's average speed had improved to 90.87 kilometres per hour (56.46 mph).
The North American Solar Challenge and the planned South African Solar Challenge are comparable competitions that reflect an international interest in the engineering and development of solar powered vehicles.
Some vehicles use solar panels for auxiliary power, such as for air conditioning, to keep the interior cool, thus reducing fuel consumption.
In 1975, the first practical solar boat was constructed in England.
By 1995, passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively.
In 1996, Kenichi Horie made the first solar-powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean, and the Sun21 catamaran made the first solar-powered crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 2006–2007.
There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010.
In 1974, the unmanned AstroFlight Sunrise airplane made the first solar flight.
On 29 April 1979, the Solar Riser made the first flight in a solar-powered, fully controlled, man-carrying flying machine, reaching an altitude of 40 ft (12 m).
In 1980, the Gossamer Penguin made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics.
This was quickly followed by the Solar Challenger which crossed the English Channel in July 1981.
In 1990 Eric Scott Raymond in 21 hops flew from California to North Carolina using solar power.
Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the Pathfinder (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the Helios which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at 29,524 metres (96,864 ft) in 2001.
The Zephyr, developed by BAE Systems, is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft, making a 54-hour flight in 2007, and month-long flights were envisioned by 2010.
From March 2015 to July 2016, Solar Impulse, an electric aircraft, successfully circumnavigated the globe.
It is a single-seat plane powered by solar cells and capable of taking off under its own power.
The design allows the aircraft to remain airborne for several days.
A solar balloon is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air.
As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands, causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon.
Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.
The Squad Solar is a Neighborhood Electric Vehicle that has a solar roof and can be plugged into a normal 120 volt outlet to be charged.
Hydrogen production technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s.
Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored.
One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (2,300–2,600 °C or 4,200–4,700 °F).
Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods.
Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production.
The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute of Science uses a 1 MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (ZnO) at temperatures above 1,200 °C (2,200 °F).
This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen.
Thermal mass systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or interseasonal durations.
Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high specific heat capacities such as water, earth and stone.
Well-designed systems can lower peak demand, shift time-of-use to off-peak hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements.
Phase change materials such as paraffin wax and Glauber's salt are another thermal storage medium.
These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can deliver domestically useful temperatures (approximately 64 °C or 147 °F).
The "Dover House" (in Dover, Massachusetts) was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948.
Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts.
Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems.
The Solar Two project used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store 1.44 terajoules (400,000 kWh) in its 68 m3 storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%.
Off-grid PV systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity.
With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls.
Net metering programs give household systems credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid.
This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes.
If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt-hour credit to the next month.
Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced.
This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter.
Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.
Pumped-storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one.
The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water, with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator.
Beginning with the surge in coal use, which accompanied the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels.
The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce.
However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th  century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum.
The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world.
It brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies.
Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan.
Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the US (SERI, now NREL), Japan (NEDO), and Germany (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE).
Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s.
These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels.
As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s, but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices.
Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s, and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999.
Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154  GW as of 2007.
The development of affordable, inexhaustible, and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits.
It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible, and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise.
These advantages are global.
Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared.
In 2011, a report by the International Energy Agency found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics, solar hot water, and concentrated solar power could provide a third of the world's energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting climate change and transitioning to renewable energy.
The energy from the Sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in energy efficiency and imposing costs on greenhouse gas emitters.
"The strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications, from small scale to big scale".
We have proved ... that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the Sun.
In 2021 Lazard estimated the levelized cost of new build unsubsidized utility scale solar electricity at less than 37 dollars per MWh and existing coal-fired power above that amount.
The 2021 report also said that new solar was also cheaper than new gas-fired power, but not generally existing gas power.
Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electricity generation.
Thermoelectric, or "thermovoltaic" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current.
A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink".
Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one.
A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system.
Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce hot water.
In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.
The goal of this system is to get high COP
and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way.
It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or hybrid (mono/polycrystalline, thin film) in combination with the heat pump.
The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduces the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system.
An electric aircraft is an aircraft that runs on electric motors rather than internal combustion engines, with electricity coming from fuel cells, solar cells, ultracapacitors, power beaming, or batteries.
Currently, flying manned electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators, though many small unmanned aerial vehicles are powered by batteries.
Electrically powered model aircraft have been flown since the 1970s, with one report in 1957.
The first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in 1973.
Between 2015 and 2016, a manned, solar-powered plane, Solar Impulse 2, completed a circumnavigation of the Earth.
The Springfield Armory, more formally known as the United States Armory and Arsenal at Springfield located in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, was the primary center for the manufacture of United States military firearms from 1777 until its closing in 1968.
It was the first federal armory and one of the first factories in the United States dedicated to the manufacture of weapons.
The site is preserved as the Springfield Armory National Historic Site, Western Massachusetts' only unit of the national park system.
It features the world's largest collection of historic American firearms.
Famous first as the United States' primary arsenal during the American Revolutionary War, and then as the scene of a confrontation during Shays' Rebellion, the Springfield Armory in the 19th and 20th centuries became the site of numerous technological innovations of global importance, including interchangeable parts, the assembly line style of mass production, and modern business practices, such as hourly wages.
The facility would play a decisive role in the American Civil War, producing most of the weaponry used by Union troops which, in sum, outpaced Confederate firearm production by a ratio of 32 to 1.
American historian Merritt Roe Smith has posited that advancements in machine manufacturing which allowed the facility to increase production capacity by more than 25 fold, from 9,601 rifles in 1860 to 276,200 in 1864, served as a precursor to the mass production of the Second Industrial Revolution and 20th century assembly line production.
The numerous firearm models produced at the Springfield Armory from 1794 to 1968 are referred to as "Springfield muskets and rifles".
Local and colonial militia used the bluff on which the Springfield Armory would become located during the 17th century for militia training, particularly after the Attack on Springfield during King Philip's War.
In 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, George Washington scouted and approved the site of the Springfield Armory, after it was referred to him by General Henry Knox, his artillery chief.
Although a small town at the time, Springfield, Massachusetts, offered obvious geographical advantages—it lay at the intersection of three rivers (including the major Connecticut River), and four major roads headed toward New York City, Boston, Albany, and Montreal.
Additionally, Springfield is located just north of the Connecticut River's first waterfall (Enfield Falls), which is too steep to be navigated by ocean-going vessels.
Thus, Springfield was the first town on the Connecticut River protected from attack by seafaring naval vessels.
The Armory site itself sits atop a high bluff like a citadel, overlooking a wide stretch of the Connecticut River, at its confluence with the Westfield River.
General Knox concurred with Washington that "the plain just above Springfield is perhaps one of the most proper spots on every account" for the location of an arsenal.
In 1777, patriot colonists established "The Arsenal at Springfield" to manufacture cartridges and gun carriages for the war effort.
During the Revolution, the arsenal stored muskets, cannon, and other weapons.
Patriots built barracks, shops, storehouses, and a magazine.
Some doubt exists that the colonists manufactured arms during the Revolutionary War.
After the war, the Army kept the facility to store arms for future needs.
By the 1780s, the Springfield Arsenal functioned as a major ammunition and weapons arsenal.
Some time later, when manufacturing became important, the arsenal expanded to a second area south and west in Springfield, where water power was available.
Around that time, the Mill River was dammed to form a mile-long lake called Watershops Pond.
The main shops were behind the dam and a foundry was built below it.
This factory was modernized, and the greater part of machining for Springfield and Garand rifles was conducted in it.
President George Washington appointed David Ames as first superintendent of the armory.
His father Capt.
John Ames was a blacksmith who had provided guns to the Colonial army.
In 1786 and 1787, American Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays led an armed, populist uprising that attempted to overthrow the Government of Massachusetts.
On January 25, 1787, thousands of Shays' Regulators marched on the Springfield Armory, hoping to seize its weaponry and force a change of government.
That day the Springfield Armory was defended by state militia, who fired grape shot at the rebels, forcing them to flee.
This confrontation proved decisive, as Shays' Rebellion was crushed soon thereafter, and some of its participants tried for treason.
In 1793, the National Arsenal contained brass ordnance, howitzers, traveling carriages, shot strapt, canisters filled, quilted grape, iron shot, shells, powder, musket ball, cylinders, caps, paper cartridges, fuzes filled, muskets, swords, various military stores, and implements.
In 1795, the Springfield Armory produced the new nation's first musket - the Model 1795 Musket which was largely patterned after the French Charleville musket which had armed the French army during the American Revolution.
The Armory played a major role in providing weapons for the American Army during the War of 1812.
Its monthly reports to the War Department are online, and they indicate it made 9588 new muskets in 1814 and repaired 5190 old ones that year.
It several times reported that its funding had been delayed.
Fueled by the Springfield Armory, the City of Springfield quickly became a national center for invention and development.
In 1819 Thomas Blanchard developed a special lathe for the consistent mass production of rifle stocks.
Thomas Blanchard worked at Springfield Armory for 5 years.
The lathe enabled an unskilled workman to quickly and easily turn out identical irregular shapes.
The large drum turned two wheels: a friction wheel that followed the contours of the metal rifle pattern, and the cutting wheel that imitated the movements of the friction wheel to make an exact replica of the pattern in wood.
In the 1840s the old flintlock gave way to a percussion ignition system that increased the reliability and simplicity of longarms.
The Springfield Armory was largely involved in the growth and influence of the Industrial Revolution.
Much of this grew out of the military's fascination with interchangeable parts, which was based on the theory that it would be easier to simply replace firearm parts than make battlefield repairs.
Mass production of truly interchangeable parts demanded greater use of machines, improved gauging, quality control, and division of labor; all characteristics of the Industrial Revolution.
From these individual components, the concept of the assembly line was devised.
The Springfield Armory also contributed to improved business management techniques.
Colonel Roswell Lee, hired as superintendent in 1815, brought centralized authority, cost accounting for payroll, time, and materials, and increased discipline to a manufacturing environment—all business practices still in use today.
With the destruction of the Harpers Ferry Armory early in the American Civil War, the Springfield Armory was briefly the only government manufacturer of arms, until the Rock Island Arsenal was established in 1862.
During this time production ramped up to unprecedented levels ever seen in American manufacturing up until that time, with only 9,601 rifles manufactured in 1860, rising to a peak of 276,200 by 1864.
These advancements would not only give the Union a decisive technological advantage over the Confederacy during the war but served as a precursor to the mass production manufacturing that contributed to the post-war Second Industrial Revolution and 20th century machine manufacturing capabilities.
American historian Merritt Roe Smith has drawn comparisons between the early assembly machining of the Springfield rifles and the later production of the Ford Model T, with the latter having considerably more parts, but producing a similar numbers of units in the earliest years of the 1913–1915 automobile assembly line, indirectly due to mass production manufacturing advancements pioneered by the armory 50 years earlier.
In 1865, Master Armorer Erskine Allin introduced the "Allin Conversion," which incorporated the far more advanced design of breech-loading into the now-obsolete muzzleloaders, thereby extending their service life.
In 1891 a new function was assigned to the Armory—it became the army's main laboratory for the development and testing of new small arms.
One of the most distinctive elements of the Armory is the fence surrounding the site, which was started after the Civil War and completed in 1890.
Unable to find funding for the purchase of a fence, Major James W. Ripley requested obsolete cannons from government storage, some from the Revolutionary War.
He had the cannons sent to a local foundry to be melted down.
The foundry kept some of the iron as payment, and the remainder was cast into 9-foot palings, formed as pikes and spearheads which were then sunk into a red sandstone base.
During the Spanish–American War, it was recognized that the Spanish Mauser Model 1893, exhibited characteristics superior to the "trapdoor" Springfield and Krag–Jørgensen rifles carried by the United States troops.
On August 15, 1900, Springfield Armory completed an experimental magazine rifle which they believed to be an improvement over the Krag.
They fashioned a clip loading magazine rifle in which the cartridges were contained within the stock, preventing damage to an otherwise exposed magazine.
It was approved for production in as the Model 1903.
Mauser later sued for patent infringement and won royalties from Springfield.
By the time that the United States entered World War I, approximately 843,239 standard service Model 1903 rifles had been manufactured.
However, this was insufficient to arm U.S. troops for an undertaking of the magnitude of World War I. During the war Springfield Armory produced over 265,620 Model 1903 rifles.
In addition, the War Department contracted for production of the M1917 Enfield Rifle to help aid American troops.
These, along with the additional 47,251 rifles produced by the Rock Island Arsenal and the weapons already in service, were enough to supply the war effort.
During World War I the Springfield Armory produced ≈25,000 M1911 pistols before all facilities were dedicated to production of M1903 rifles.
In 1919, when John Garand was 31, he came to Springfield, where he worked to develop a semi-automatic rifle.
Over the next five years many designs were submitted for the rifle, but none met the army's rigid specifications.
In 1924, Garand offered a design that was approved for further testing.
This was the famous M1, or "Garand rifle" as it came to be known.
The army adopted the rifle in 1936, and production began the next year.
This began what was to become the greatest production effort in the armory's history: during the entire production history of the M1 rifle, the Springfield Armory produced over 4.5 million of them.
The last small arm developed by the Armory was the M14 rifle, which was, essentially, a highly modified version of the M1 Garand.
The M14 was produced from 1959 to 1964 and was the U.S. Army's primary combat rifle until being replaced by the M16 rifle gradually from 1964 to 1970.
The M14 has evolved over the years into a more modern sniper rifle—the M21.
By the time the U.S. was involved in the Vietnam War, Springfield Armory developed not only rifles but machine guns for ground and air use, grenade launchers, and associated equipment.
Many weapons were not manufactured at the Armory, but plans and specifications were drawn up for the use of private contractors who built them elsewhere, representing an economic shift toward the American private arms industry.
In 1968, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara announced the closure of the Springfield Armory.
Outer portions of the armory were sold off, including the "Water Shops" production facilities, which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Water Shops Armory.
The core site was preserved and the property was turned over to the city and state.
It is now the Springfield Armory National Historic Site, and is managed and operated by the National Park Service.
As of 2011, the 35 acres behind the Springfield Armory (and several of its former buildings) house Springfield Technical Community College (STCC).
STCC is the only "technical" community college in Massachusetts, which aims to continue the legacy of technological innovation at the Springfield Armory site.
The Main Arsenal Building and the Commandants House were extensively renovated by Eastern General Contractors of Springfield, Massachusetts between 1987 and 1991.
The Main Arsenal now houses the Springfield Armory Museum, which includes the Benton Small Arms Collection, one of the largest collections of weaponry.
Following the closure of the U.S. Army Springfield Armory in 1968, the L. H. Gun Co. of Devine, Texas, was renamed Springfield Armory, Inc. to capitalize on the name recognition.
There is no affiliation or licensing between the original Springfield Armory and Springfield Armory, Inc., despite a timeline on the commercial website of the latter that includes the history of the former.
The company's products include M1911 pistols and the M1A rifle series.
A steam bus is a bus powered by a steam engine.
Early steam-powered vehicles designed for carrying passengers were more usually known as steam carriages, although this term was sometimes used to describe other early experimental vehicles too.
Regular intercity bus services by steam-powered buses were pioneered in England in the 1830s by associates of Sir Goldsworthy Gurney and by Walter Hancock among others, running reliable services over road conditions which were too hazardous for horse-drawn transportation.
Steam carriages were much less likely to overturn, and did not "run away with" the customer as horses sometimes did.
They travelled faster than horse-drawn carriages (24 mph or 39 km/h over four miles or 6.4 kilometres and an average of 12 mph or 19 km/h over longer distances).
They could run at a half to a third of the cost of horse-drawn carriages.
Their brakes did not lock and drag like horse-drawn transport (a phenomenon that increased damage to roads).
According to engineers, steam carriages caused one-third the damage to the road surface as that caused by the action of horses' feet.
Indeed, the wide tires of the steam carriages (designed for better traction) caused virtually no damage to the streets, whereas the narrow wheels of the horse-drawn carriages (designed to reduce the effort required of horses) tended to cause rutting.
However, the heavy road tolls imposed by the Turnpike Acts discouraged steam road vehicles and left the way clear for the horse bus companies, and from 1861 onwards, harsh legislation virtually eliminated mechanically propelled vehicles altogether from the roads of Great Britain for 30 years, the Locomotive Act 1861 imposing restrictive speed limits on "road locomotives" of 5 mph (8.0 km/h) in towns and cities, and 10 mph (16 km/h) in the country.
The Locomotives Act 1865 (the famous Red Flag Act) further reduced the speed limits to 4 mph (6.4 km/h) in the country and just 2 mph (3.2 km/h) in towns and cities, additionally requiring a man bearing a red flag to precede every vehicle.
At the same time, the act gave local authorities the power to specify the hours during which any such vehicle might use the roads.
The sole exceptions were street trams which from 1879 onwards were authorised under licence from the Board of Trade.
In 1881, the engineer John Inshaw built a steam carriage for use in Aston, Birmingham, UK.
Capable of carrying ten people at speeds of up to 12 mph, Inshaw discontinued his experiments due to the legislation then in force.
The Red Flag Act was repealed in 1896, and experimental steam buses again operated in various places in England and around the empire.
Liquid Fuel Engineering Co. (Lifu) of Cowes built steam buses from 1897 to 1901.
Lifu buses ran at Mansfield from 1 July 1898, between Dover and Deal in 1899, Fairford and Cirencester for the Midland and South Western Junction Railway in 1898 and 1899.
In 1899 a 24-seat (14 on top) bus of E. Gillett & Co (Hounslow) was licensed, but ran no regular service.
Straker buses were run by Potteries Electric Traction from 1901.
London Road car Co ran a Hammersmith-Shepherd's Bush-Oxford Circus route with a Thornycroft 36 seater (12 inside) in 1902.
Thomas Clarkson produced steam buses at Moulsham Works, Chelmsford and exhibited at 1903 and 1905 Motor Shows.
Torquay had steam buses from 1903 to 1923.
In May 1903 a Chelmsford steam bus demonstration resulted in the formation of the Torquay & District Motor Omnibus Co Ltd on 23 July 1903.
The company's prospectus said, "The Chelmsford motor omnibuses are steam propelled, and, what is of importance in a town of the character of Torquay, are entirely free from smell, noise, and vibration."
3 single deck 14 seat (12 inside and 2 with the driver)
Chelmsford steam buses were ordered in May, built in August, but got stuck in mud between Salisbury and Exeter and didn't start a Strand to Chelston service until 2 November.
There were 2,828 passengers in the first week.
2 more steam buses arrived in January 1904 and 8 were working by Easter 1905, the last 3 being 20 seaters.
They had two-cylinder horizontal engines, with tubular boilers, and a working pressure of 150 to 250psi.
They averaged a gallon of paraffin for 3.8 miles.
1904 costs were under 8½d per mile, made up of lubricants 0.2d., wages and fuel 5d.
and repairs, establishment, and other charges 3.3d.
Fares were 1d.
to 4d., with 15 minute frequencies on two routes, and half-hourly on the others.
The company declared a 7½% dividend in its first year.
All the Torquay buses were sold to Harrogate Road car company just before Torquay Tramways opened in April 1907, but the Torquay Road car Co took over the garage and bought 6 Chelmsfords, 3 from Vale of Llangollen, 2 from Eastbourne Corporation and 1 from Great Western Railway.
The new company was liquidated on 24 December 1908 and 3 buses sold to Bargoed Motor Service Company in 1909.
The Torquay-Chelston Steam Car Company Ltd was formed on 28 March 1911 and took over the 3 unsold Chelmsfords and a new 25 seater Clarkson type IV steam bus from August 1911.
The steam buses were replaced by petrol in 1923, when Devon General started to compete on the Chelston route.
In London Chelmsfords had mixed fortunes.
Single-deck Chelmsfords were used by London General Omnibus Co and London Road-Car Co, but the last were withdrawn in 1905 because of heavy losses.
However, double deck Chelmsfords with improved boilers were delivered to London Road-Car in 1905 and in 1909 National Steam Car Co. Ltd also started to run double deck Chelmsfords in London.
By 1914 National Steam had 184, but post war replacements were petrol and its last steam bus ran in London on 18 November 1919.
Darracq-Serpollet steam buses were run by the Metropolitan Steam Omnibus Co Ltd from 5 October 1907 to 16 October 1912.
When London General took over its main rivals on 1 July 1908 it had 1066 motor buses, 35 of them steam.
A year later London General had abandoned steam.
Steam power for road transportation saw a modest revival in the 1920s.
It was economical to use, with prices of fuel oil (such as kerosene) being about one-third that of gasoline, with comparable fuel consumption to contemporary gasoline-engined vehicles.
Additionally, startup times vis-a-vis gasoline-powered vehicles and safety issues from vaporized fuel had been solved, with steam cars such as the Doble requiring a mere 40 seconds to start from cold.
In 1931 Doble was employed as a consultant by A & G Price of Thames, New Zealand to construct a steam engine for buses.
Four were built in 1931, but plans were shelved as the depression deepened and the Auckland bus was too heavy for the roads.
However, two 1932 reports described progress with construction.
The Canadian company Brooks Steam Motors of Toronto, Ontario produced steam city buses in the 1920s.
More recently, in 1972, the American inventor Bill Lear introduced a steam bus intended for trials in San Francisco.
A steam bus named Elizabeth operates in Weston Super Mare (originally in the English seaside town of Whitby).
A sport utility vehicle (SUV) is a car classification that combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.
There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV and usage of the term varies between countries.
Thus, it is "a loose term that traditionally covers a broad range of vehicles with four-wheel drive."
Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV.
A crossover SUV is often defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction (as with passenger cars); however, the designations are increasingly blurred because of the capabilities of the vehicles, the labelling by marketers, and electrification of new models.
The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s, and the four-wheel-drive station wagons and carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949.
Some SUVs produced today use unibody construction; however, in the past, more SUVs used body-on-frame construction.
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the popularity of SUVs greatly increased, often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons.
SUVs accounted for 45.9% of the world's passenger car market in 2021.
SUVs have been criticized for a variety of environmental and safety-related reasons.
They generally have poorer fuel efficiency and require more resources to manufacture than smaller vehicles, contributing more to climate change and environmental degradation.
Between 2010 and 2018 SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the global increase in carbon emissions worldwide.
Their higher center of gravity increases their risk of rollovers.
Their higher front-end profile makes them at least twice as likely to kill pedestrians they hit.
Additionally, the psychological sense of security they provide influences drivers to drive less cautiously.
There is no universally accepted definition of the sport utility vehicle.
Dictionaries, automotive experts, and journalists use varying wordings and defining characteristics, in addition to regional variations of usage by both the media and the general public.
The auto industry also has not settled on one definition of the SUV.
The actual term "Sport Utility Vehicle" did not come into wide popular usage until the late 1980s.
Before then, such vehicles were marketed as four-wheel drives, jeeps, station wagons, or other terms.
Automotive websites' descriptions of SUVs range from specifically "combining car-like appointments and wagon practicality with steadfast off-road capability" with "chair-height seats and picture-window visibility" to the more general "nearly anything with available all-wheel drive and raised ground clearance".
It is also suggested that the term "SUV" has replaced "jeep" as a general term for off-road vehicles.
In Europe, the term SUV is generally used for road-oriented vehicles, described as "J-segment" by the European Commission.
"Four-by-four" or the brand name of the vehicle is typically used for off-road-oriented vehicles.
Similarly, in New Zealand, vehicles designed for off-road use are typically referred to as "four-wheel drives" instead of SUVs.
In the United States, many government regulations simply have categories for "off-highway vehicles" which are loosely defined and often result in SUVs (along with pick-up trucks and minivans) being classified as light trucks.
For example, corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) regulations previously included "permit greater cargo-carrying capacity than passenger carrying volume" in the definition for trucks, resulting in cars with removable rear seats, like the PT Cruiser, being classified as light trucks.
This classification as trucks allowed SUVs to be regulated less strictly than passenger cars under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act for fuel economy, and the Clean Air Act for emissions.
However, from 2004 onwards, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began to hold sport utility vehicles to the same tailpipe emissions standards as cars for criteria pollutants, though not greenhouse gas emissions standards as they were not set until 2010.
In 2011, the CAFE regulations were changed to classify small, two-wheel-drive SUVs as passenger cars.
However, the licensing and traffic enforcement regulations in the United States vary from state to state, and an SUV may be classified as a car in some states but as a truck in others.
For industry production statistics, SUVs are counted in the light truck product segment.
In India, all SUVs are classified in the "Utility Vehicle" category per the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) definitions and carry a 27% excise tax.
Those that are 4 metres (13 feet) long, have a 1,500 cc (92 cu in) engine or larger, along with 170 mm (6.7 in) of ground clearance, are subject to a 30% excise duty.
In Australia, SUV sales were helped by having lower import duties than passenger cars.
Up until January 2010, SUVs were subject to a 5% import tariff, compared with 10% for passenger cars.
In February 2024, voters in Paris mandated a triple parking charge rate for SUVs, citing environmental impact and street capacity; this followed similar decisions in Lyon and Tübingen with similar ordinances being considered by London, Brussels and Amsterdam.
Many years after most passenger cars had transitioned to unibody construction, most SUVs continued to use a separate body-on-frame method, due to being based on the chassis from a light truck, commercial vehicle, pickup truck, or off-road vehicle.
The first mass-produced unibody four-wheel-drive passenger car was the Russian 1955 GAZ-M20 Pobeda M-72, which could be considered the first crossover car.
The 1977 Lada Niva was the first off-road vehicle to use both a unibody construction and a coil-sprung independent front suspension.
The relatively compact Niva is considered a predecessor to the crossover SUV and combines a hatchback-like passenger car body with full-time four-wheel drive, low-range gearing, and lockable center differential.
Nonetheless, unibody SUVs remained rare until the 1984 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) was introduced and became a sales success.
The introduction of the 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee resulted in all Jeep SUV models using unibody construction, with many other brands following suit since the mid-1990s.
Today, most SUVs in production use a unibody construction and relatively few models continue to use body-on-frame construction.
SUVs are typically of a two-box design similar to a station wagon.
The engine compartment is in the front, followed by a combined passenger/cargo area (unlike a sedan, which has a separate trunk/boot compartment).
Up until approximately 2010, many SUV models were available in two-door body styles.
Since then, manufacturers began to discontinue the two-door models as the four-door models became more popular.
A few two-door SUVs remain available, such as the body-on-frame Suzuki Jimny, Mahindra Thar, Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, Ford Bronco, and Jeep Wrangler as well as the Range Rover Evoque crossover SUV.
SUVs typically have high ground clearance and a tall body.
This results in a high center of mass, which made SUVs more prone to roll-over accidents.
In 2003, SUVs were quoted as 2.5 times more likely to roll over in a crash than regular cars and that SUV roofs were more likely to cave in on passengers than in other cars, resulting in increased harm to passengers.
Between 1991 and 2001, the United States saw a 150% increase in sport-utility vehicle rollover deaths.
In 2001, though roll-overs constituted just 3% of vehicle crashes overall, they caused over 30% of occupant fatalities in crashes; and in crashes where the vehicle did roll over, SUV occupants in the early 2000s were nearly three times as likely to be killed as other car passengers.
Vehicles with a high center of gravity do sometimes fail the moose test of maneuverability conducted by Swedish consumer magazine Teknikens Värld, for example, the 1997 Mercedes-Benz A-Class and 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
The increasing popularity of SUVs in the 1990s and early 2000s was partly due to buyers perceiving that SUVs provide greater safety for occupants, due to their larger size and raised ride height.
Regarding the safety of other road users, SUVs are exempted from U.S. regulation stating that a passenger car bumper must protect the area between 16 and 20 inches (41 and 51 cm) above the ground.
This often increases the damage to the other car in a collision with an SUV, because the impact occurs at a higher location on the other car.
In 2000–2001, 60% of fatal side-impact collisions were where the other vehicle was an SUV, an increase from 30% in 1980–1981.
The high danger for cyclists and pedestrians of being seriously injured or even killed by SUV drivers has caused some public protests against SUVs in urban areas.
In 2020, a study by the U.S.-based IIHS found that, of a sample of 79 crashes from three urban areas in Michigan, SUVs caused more serious injuries compared to cars when impacts occurred at greater than 31 km/h (19 mph).
The IIHS noted the sample size of the study was small and that more research is needed.
The popularity of SUVs contributed to an increase in pedestrian fatalities in the U.S. during the 2010s, alongside other factors such as distracted and drunk driving.
A 2021 study by the University of Illinois Springfield showed that SUVs are 8 times more likely to kill children in a collision than passenger cars, and multiple times more lethal to adult pedestrians and cyclists.
SUVs generally have poorer fuel efficiency than smaller cars, and thus contribute more to environmental degradation and global warming.
SUVs emit about 700 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per year, a gas that is linked to global warming.
According to the International Energy Agency, from 2010 SUVs have been the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions, second only to the power sector.
SUVs were responsible for all of the 3.3 million barrels a day growth in oil demand from passenger cars between 2010 and 2018, whereas efficiency improvements in smaller cars saved over 2 million barrels a day, with electric cars reducing oil demand by under 100,000 barrels a day.
Whereas SUVs can be electrified, or converted to run on a variety of alternative fuels, including hydrogen, their (manufacturing) emissions will always be larger than smaller electric cars.
On average, SUVs consume about a quarter more energy than medium-size cars.
Furthermore, the vast majority of these vehicles are not converted to use alternative fuels.
Between 2010 and 2018 SUVs were the second largest contributor to the global increase in carbon emissions worldwide.
The "crossover SUV" segment (also known as "CUVs" or simply "crossovers") has become increasingly popular since around 2010.
Crossovers are often based on a platform shared with a passenger car, as a result, they typically have better comfort and fuel economy, but less off-road capability (many crossovers are sold without all-wheel drive) than pickup truck-based SUVs.
The difference between crossovers and other SUVs is sometimes defined as a crossover being built using a unibody platform (the type used by most passenger cars), while an SUV is built using a body-on-frame platform (the type used by off-road vehicles and light trucks).
However, these definitions are often blurred in practice, since unibody vehicles are also often referred to as SUVs.
Also, crossover is a relatively recent term and early unibody SUVs (such as the 1984 Jeep Cherokee) are rarely called crossovers.
Due to these inconsistencies, the term SUV is often used as a catch-all for both crossovers and SUVs.
Outside of the United States, the term crossover tends to be used for C-segment (compact) or smaller vehicles, with large unibody vehicles—such as the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class, BMW X7, and Range Rover—usually referred to as SUVs rather than crossovers.
In the United Kingdom, a crossover is sometimes defined as a hatchback model with raised ride height and SUV-like styling features.
The smallest size class of SUVs is the "mini SUV".
In Japan, SUVs under 3,400 mm (133.9 in)—such as the Mitsubishi Pajero Mini—are included in the kei car category and therefore attract lower taxes.
Many recent vehicles labeled as mini SUVs are technically subcompact crossovers and are built on the platform of a subcompact (also called supermini or B-segment) passenger car.
The "compact SUV" is the next bigger-size class after mini SUVs.
Many recent vehicles labeled as compact SUVs are technically compact crossovers and are built on the platform of a compact (C-segment) passenger car.
The next larger size is called the "mid-size SUV".
Some mid-size SUVs are based on platforms shared with passenger cars and therefore, are crossovers.
Other mid-size SUVs are based on compact or mid-size pickups.
Full-size SUVs are the largest size of commonly produced SUVs.
Some, such as the Ford Expedition, and Chevrolet Tahoe, are marketed for their off-road capabilities, and others, such as the Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade, are marketed as luxury vehicles.
While a few full-size SUVs are built on dedicated platforms; most share their platforms with full-size pickup trucks.
Some North American SUVs are available as a long-bodied version of a full-size SUV, which is called an "extended-length SUV" like the Ford Expedition EL and the Chevrolet Suburban.
The additional length is used to provide extra space for rear passengers or cargo.
As per the full-size SUVs they are based on, most extended-length SUVs are built on dedicated platforms, full-sized pickups (1⁄2 ton), or heavy-duty pickups (3⁄4 ton or more).
Extended-length SUVs are mostly sold in North America but may also be exported to other markets in small numbers.
Some SUVs or crossovers with sloping rear rooflines are marketed as "coupe crossover SUVs" or "coupe SUVs", even though they have four side doors for passenger access to the seats and rear hatches for cargo area access.
Just before and during World War II, prototypes and low-volume production examples of military cars with sedan or station wagon-type bodies and rugged, off-road capable four-wheel drive chassis began to appear around the world.
These early models included the 1936 Kurogane Type 95 from Japan, the 1938 GAZ-61 from Russia as well as the 1941 Volkswagen Kommandeurswagen and 1936 Opel Geländesportwagen from Germany.
An early predecessor to the design of modern SUVs was the 1940 Humber Heavy Utility, a four-wheel-drive off-road vehicle built on the chassis of the Humber Super Snipe passenger car.
The most prohibitive initial factors to the potential civilian popularity of an SUV-like car were their cost and the availability of certain critical parts.
Before the war, adding four-wheel drive to a car almost doubled its cost.
Compared to a common, rear-wheel drive vehicle, any 4WD (four-wheel drive) needed many essential extra components, including a transfer case, a second differential, and constant-velocity joints for the driven front axle—which were expensive due to the precision involved in this required manufacturing gears and other specialized parts.
Before World War II, these were produced in the United States by only a few specialized firms with limited production capacity.
Due to the increase in demand for parts for the war effort, in the spring of 1942 Ford, Dodge, and Chevrolet joined in fabricating these parts in mass quantities, boosting their production more than 100-fold.
An early usage of the term was the 1947 Crosley CC Four Sport Utility model, which used a convertible wagon body style and is therefore unrelated to the design of later SUVs.
Several models of carryall wagons began to be offered with four-wheel drive, beginning in 1949 when the Willys Jeep Station Wagon introduced the option of four-wheel drive.
Four-wheel-drive versions of the Chevrolet Suburban were introduced for 1955, followed by the International Harvester Travelall in 1956 (credited as being the first full-size SUV) and the Power Wagon Town Wagon in 1957.
Developed as a competitor to the Jeep CJ, the compact International Scout was introduced in 1961, offering either two- or four-wheel drive and a variety of engine options.
The Harvester Scout provided many other options designed to appeal to a wide range of customers for numerous uses as well.
The 1963 Jeep Wagoneer (SJ) introduced a sophisticated station wagon body design that was more carlike than any other four-wheel-drive vehicle on the market.
The 1967 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ55 station wagon was the first comfort-oriented version of the Land Cruiser off-road vehicle.
The two-door Chevrolet K5 Blazer (and related GMC K5 Jimmy) were introduced for 1969, and the two-door International Scout II was introduced in 1971.
The first European luxury off-road vehicle was the 1970 Range Rover Classic, which was marketed as a luxury car for both on-road and off-road usage.
In 1972 Subaru Leone 4WD wagon was introduced in Japan, which was not designed as an off-road vehicle, but a version of the front-wheel-drive passenger car.
Some argue that this was the first SUV.
It was also classified as a commercial vehicle in the home market, just like later SUVs.
The first relevant usage of the term SUV was in advertising brochures for the full-sized 1974 Jeep Cherokee (SJ), which used the wording "sport(s) utility vehicle" as a description for the vehicle.
The 1966 Ford Bronco included a "sport utility" model; however, in this case it was used for the two-door pickup truck version.
The VAZ-2121 (now designated Lada Niva Legend) was the first mass-market 4WD unibody car in some markets in 1977.
The AMC Eagle introduced in the North American market in 1979, and is often called the first mass-market "crossover", although that term had not been coined at the time.
In contrast to truck or utility-vehicle based designs and the Niva that was purpose-built for rural areas, American Motors Corporation (AMC) utilized a long-serving existing car platform and designed a new automatic full-time AWD system.
The AMC Eagle was developed as a passenger car offering numerous comfort, luxury, and convenience features in sedan, coupe, and station wagon body styles.
It was first with "SUV styling on a raised passenger-car platform combined with AWD."
Four Wheeler magazine described the AMC Eagle as "the beginning of a new generation of cars".
The U.S. corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard was introduced in 1975 to reduce fuel usage, but included relaxed regulations for "light trucks" to avoid businesses paying extra taxes for work vehicles.
This created a loophole that manufacturers increasingly exploited since the 1980s oil glut (which started an era of cheap gasoline), whereby SUVs were designed to be classified as light trucks despite their primary use as passenger vehicles to receive tax concessions and less stringent fuel economy requirements.
This enabled manufacturers to sell more profitable, larger, more polluting vehicles, instead of the smaller, less polluting, less profitable cars, that the CAFE regulations intended.
For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency agreed to classify the new Jeep Cherokee as a light truck following lobbying from its manufacturer; the Cherokee was then marketed by the company as a passenger vehicle.
This increased the SUV boom as other manufacturers introduced their own SUVs in response to the compact Cherokee taking sales from their regular cars.
In 1994 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began classifying vehicles by "market class".
For SUVs in 1994 they included three Jeep models, the Cherokee, Grand Cherokee and Wrangler.
Two Ford models were the Bronco and the Explorer.
Six General Motors models including the GMC Jimmy, the Yukon, and the Suburban 1500; the Chevrolet Suburban 1500, and the Blazer (1500 and S10); the Geo Tracker (Convertible or Van); and finally the Oldsmobile Bravada.
Eleven Japanese models classified as SUVs were the Toyota 4Runner and Land Cruiser; the Honda Passport; the Nissan Pathfinder; the Mazda Navajo; the Mitsubishi Montero; the Isuzu Amigo, Rodeo, and Trooper; and the Suzuki Samurai and Sidekick.
From Europe the three Land Rover models, the Range Rover, the Defender and the Discovery were classified as SUVs.
By 2003, there were 76 million SUVs and light trucks on U.S. roads, representing approximately 35% of the vehicles on the road.
Car manufacturers were keen to promote SUV sales over other types of cars due to higher profits in the segment.
An SUV could be sold with a profit margin of US$10,000 or more (US$18,000 per SUV in the case of the Ford Excursion), while compact cars were often sold at a loss of a few hundred dollars per car.
As a result, several manufacturing plants were converted from car production to SUV production (such as the General Motors plant in Arlington, Texas in 1996), and many long-running U.S. sedan models were discontinued.
From the mid-2000s until 2010, U.S. sales of SUVs and other light trucks experienced a dip due to increasing fuel prices and then a declining economy.
From 2008 until 2010, General Motors closed four assembly plants that were producing SUVs and trucks.
Sales of SUVs and light trucks sales began to recover in 2010, as fuel prices decreased and the North American economy improved.
In 2019, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that the global number of SUVs and crossovers on the road multiplied by six since 2010—from 35 million to 200 million vehicles, and their market share has grown to 40 percent of worldwide new light-vehicle sales at the end of the decade.
By 2013, small and compact SUVs had increased to become the third-largest market segment.
Since the early 2000s, new versions have been introduced to appeal to a wider audience, such as crossovers and other small SUVs.
Larger SUVs also remained popular, with sales of General Motors' large SUV models increasing significantly in 2013.
In 2015, global sales of SUVs overtook the "lower medium car" segment, to become the largest market segment, accounting for 22.9% of "light vehicle" sales in 2015.
The following year, worldwide SUV sales experienced further growth of 22%.
The world's fastest-growing SUV markets in 2014–2015 were: China (+ 47.9%), Italy (+ 48.6%), Spain (+ 42%), Portugal (+ 54.8 %), and Thailand (+ 56.4%).
The SUV segment further grew to 26% of the global passenger car market in 2016, then to 36.8% of the market in Q1–Q3 of 2017.
In the U.S. at the end of 2016, sales of SUVs and light-duty trucks had surpassed traditional car sales for the year by over 3 million units.
Manufacturers continued to phase out the production of sedan models, replacing them with new models of SUVs.
Luxury brands have increasingly introduced SUV or crossover models in the 2010s.
For example: Rolls-Royce Cullinan, Bentley Bentayga, Aston Martin DBX, Maserati Levante, Lamborghini Urus, and Ferrari Purosangue.
In 2019 SUVs made up 47.4% of U.S. sales compared to only 22.1% for sedans.
SUVs have competed in various off-road racing competitions, such as the Dakar Rally, Baja 1000, FIA Cross-Country Rally World Cup, King of the Hammers, and Australasian Safari.
SUVs have also competed in the Trophee Andros ice-racing series.
Several derogatory or pejorative terms for SUVs are based on the combination of an affluent suburb name and "tractor", particularly for expensive vehicles from luxury brands.
Examples include "Toorak Tractor" (Melbourne, Australia), "Chelsea Tractor" (London, England) and "Remuera Tractor" (Auckland, New Zealand).
These terms relate to the theory that four-wheel drive capabilities are not required by affluent SUV owners, and that the SUV is purchased as a status symbol rather than for practical reasons.
In Norway, the term Børstraktor ('Stock Exchange Tractor') serves a similar purpose.
In the Netherlands, SUVs are sometimes called "P.C. Hooft-tractors" after the exclusive P.C.
Hooftstraat Amsterdam shopping street.
A commercial SUV is an SUV or crossover, that is used for commercial purposes.
The category is very similar to panel trucks since the Chevrolet Suburban (an SUV) had panel truck versions, which were used for commercial purposes.
The first SUV-like vehicle that had commercial versions was the Chevrolet Suburban panel truck.
Panel trucks by American manufacturers were built until the late 1970s.
While panel trucks manufactured by European manufacturers were rare, commercial versions of off-road vehicles were very common, Land Rover manufactured commercial versions of the Land Rover and the Defender.
Commercial SUVs are factory-built and most of them are not independent conversions, which means they can be bought from dealerships and showrooms.
Examples of SUVs used as commercial vehicles in Europe include: Citroen C5 Aircross Commercial SUV, the Land Rover Discovery, the Dacia Duster Flika, and the Mitsubishi Pajero.
A sports car is a type of car that is designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, the thrill of driving, and racing capability.
Sports cars originated in Europe in early 1910s and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.
Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance, without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance.
Broader definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity", or that emphasise the "thrill of driving" or are marketed "using the excitement of speed and the glamour of the (race)track" However, other people have more specific definitions, such as "must be a two-seater or a 2+2 seater" or a car with two seats only.
In the United Kingdom, early recorded usage of the "sports car" was in The Times newspaper in 1919.
The first known use of the term in the United States was in 1928.
Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.
The term initially described two-seat roadsters (cars without a fixed roof), however, since the 1970s the term has also been used for cars with a fixed roof (which were previously considered grand tourers).
Attributing the definition of 'sports car' to any particular model can be controversial or the subject of debate among enthusiasts.
Authors and experts have often contributed their ideas to capture a definition.
Insurance companies have also attempted to use mathematical formulae to categorise sports cars, often charging more for insurance due to the inherent risk of performance driving.
There is no fixed distinction between sports cars and other categories of performance cars, such as muscle cars and grand tourers, with some cars being members of several categories.
Traditionally, the most common layout for sports cars was a roadster (a two-seat car without a fixed roof), however there are also several examples of early sports cars with four seats.
Sports cars are not usually intended to regularly transport more than two adult occupants, so most modern sports cars are usually two-seat layout or 2+2 layout (two smaller rear seats for children or occasional adult use).
Larger cars with more spacious rear-seat accommodation are usually considered sports sedans rather than sports cars.
The 1993-1998 McLaren F1 is notable for using a three-seat layout, where the front row consists of a centrally-located driver's seat.
The location of the engine and driven wheels significantly influence the handling characteristics of a car and are therefore important in the design of a sports car.
Traditionally, most sports cars have used rear-wheel drive with the engine either located at the front of the car (FR layout) or in the middle of the car (MR layout).
Examples of FR layout sports cars are the Caterham 7, Mazda MX-5, and the Dodge Viper.
Examples of MR layout sports cars are the Ferrari 488, Ford GT and Toyota MR2.
To avoid a front-heavy weight distribution, many FR layout sports cars are designed so that the engine is located further back in the engine bay, as close to the firewall as possible.
Since the 1990s, all-wheel drive has become more common in sports cars.
All-wheel drive offers better acceleration and favorable handling characteristics (especially in slippery conditions), but is often heavier and more mechanically complex than traditional layouts.
Examples of all-wheel drive sports cars are the Lamborghini Huracan, Bugatti Veyron, and Nissan GT-R. Rear engine layouts are not commonly used for sports cars, with the notable exception of the Porsche 911.
Although front-wheel drive with the engine at the front (FF layout) is the most common layout for cars in general, it is not as common amongst traditional sports cars.
Nonetheless, the FF layout is often used by sport compacts and hot hatches such as the Mazdaspeed3.
Examples of FF layout sports cars are the Fiat Barchetta, Saab Sonett, or Opel Tigra.
The basis for the sports car is traced to the early 20th century touring cars and roadsters, and the term 'sports car' would not be coined until after World War One.
A car considered to be "a sports-car years ahead of its time" is the 1903 Mercedes Simplex 60 hp, described at the time as a fast touring car and designed by Wilhelm Maybach and Paul Daimler.
The Mercedes included pioneering features such as a pressed-steel chassis, a gated 4-speed transmission, pushrod-actuated overhead inlet valves, a honeycomb radiator, low-tension magneto ignition, a long wheelbase, a low center of mass and a very effective suspension system.
The overall result was a "safe and well-balanced machine" with a higher performance than any other contemporary production car.
At the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup, a production Simplex 60 hp was entered only due to a specially-built 90 hp racing car being destroyed in a fire; the 60 hp famously went on to win the race.
The 1910 Austro-Daimler 27/80 is another early sports car which had success in motor racing.
The 27/80 was designed by Ferdinand Porsche, who drove the car to victory in the 1910 Prince Henry Tour motor race.
The Vauxhall and Austro-Daimler —like the Mercedes Simplex 60 hp— were production fast touring cars.
The 1912 Hispano-Suiza Alfonso XIII is also considered one of the earliest sports cars, as it was a "purpose built, high performance, two-seater production automobile".
The model was named after King Alfonso XIII of Spain, a patron of the car's chief designer and an enthusiast for the marque.
Other early sports cars include the 1905 Isotta Fraschini Tipo D, the 1906 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, the 1908 Delage, the 1910 Bugatti Type 13, and the 1912 DFP 12/15.
Early motor racing events included the 1903 Paris–Madrid race, the 1905-1907 Herkomer Trophy, the 1908-1911 Prince Henry Tour and the 1911–present Monte Carlo Rally.
The Prince Henry Tours (which were similar to modern car rallies) were among the sporting events of the period, bringing renown to successful entrants.
The Prince Henry Tours started the evolution of reasonably large and technically advanced production sports cars.
In England, the development of sporting cars was inhibited by the Motor Car Act 1903, which imposed a speed limit of 20 mph (32 km/h) on all public roads.
This led to the 1907 opening of the Brooklands motor circuit, which inspired the development of performance cars such as the 1910 Vauxhall Prince Henry, 1910 Sunbeam 12/16, 1910 Talbot 25 hp, 1910 Straker-Squire 15 hp and 1913 Star 15.9 hp.
Following the halt in sports car production caused by World War I, Europe returned to manufacturing automobiles from around 1920.
It was around this time that the term 'Sports Car' began to appear in the motor catalogues, although the exact origin of the name is not known.
The decade that followed became known as the vintage era and featured rapid technical advances over the preceding Brass Era cars.
Engine performance benefited from the abandonment of "tax horsepower" (where vehicles were taxed based on bore and number of cylinders, rather than actual power output) and the introduction of leaded fuel, which increased power by allowing for higher compression ratios.
In the early 1920s, the cost to produce a racing car was not significantly higher than a road car, therefore several manufacturers used the design from the current year's racing car for the next year's sports car.
For example, the 1921 Ballot 2LS based on the racing car that finished third at the 1921 French Grand Prix.
The Benz 28/95PS was also a successful racing car, with victories including the 1921 Coppa Florio.
Another approach— such as that used by Morris Garages— was to convert touring cars into sports cars.
The first 24 Hours of Le Mans race for sports cars was held in 1923, although the two-seat sports cars only competed in the smallest class, with the majority of cars entered being four-seat fast touring cars.
"This race, together with the Tourist Trophy Series of Races, organised after the first World War by the R.A.C., appealed to the public imagination and offered to the manufacturers of the more sporting cars an excellent opportunity for boosting sales of their products."
The classic Italian road races— the Targa Florio, and the Mille Miglia (first held in 1927)— also captured the public's imagination.
By 1925, the higher profits available for four-seater cars resulted in the production of two-seat sports cars being limited to smaller manufacturers such as Aston-Martin (350 Astons built from 1921 to 1939) and Frazer-Nash (323 cars built from 1924 to 1939).
Then by the late 1920s, the cost of producing racing cars (especially Grand Prix cars) escalated, causing more manufacturers to produce cars for the growing sports car market instead.
Significant manufacturers of sports cars in the late 1920s were AC Cars, Alfa Romeo, Alvis, Amilcar, Bignan and Samson, Chenard-Walcker, Delage, Hispano-Suiza, Hotchkiss, Mercedes-Benz and Nazzaro.
Two cars from the Vintage Era that would influence sports cars for many years were the Austin Seven and MG M-type "Midget".
Successful sports cars from Bentley during this era were the Bentley 3 Litre (1921-1929) and the Bentley Speed Six (1928-1930), with the former famously described by Bugatti's founder as "the fastest lorry in the world".
Between the Great Depression and the World War II the pre-war era was a period of decline in importance for sports car manufacturers, although the period was not devoid of advances, for example streamlining.
Cheap, light-weight family sedans with independent front suspension— such as the BMW 303, Citroën Traction Avant and Fiat 508— offered similar handling and comfort to the more expensive sports cars.
Powerful, reliable, and economical (although softly suspended) American saloons began to be imported to Europe in significant numbers.
Sports car ownership was increased through models such as the Austin 7 and Wolseley Hornet six, however many of these sports cars did not offer any performance upgrades over the mass-produced cars upon which they were based.
The highest selling sports car company of the 1930s was Morris Garages, who produced 'MG Midget' models of the M-Type, J-Type, P-Type and T-Type.
The K3 version of the K-Type Magnette was a successful racing car, achieving success in the Mille Miglia, Tourist Trophy and 24 Hours of Le Mans.
The Bugatti Type 57 (1934-1940) was another significant sports car of the pre-war era and is now among the most valuable cars in the world.
The T57 was successful in sports car races, including winning the 1937 24 Hours of Le Mans and 1939 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Another successful Bugatti sports car was the Bugatti Type 55 (1932-1935), which was based on the Type 51 Grand Prix racing car.
In Italy, a small but wealthy market segment allowed for the manufacture of a limited number of high-performance models directly allied to contemporary Grand Prix machines, such as the 1948 Ferrari 166 S. A new concept altogether was the modern Gran Turismo class from Italy, which was in effect unknown before the war: sustained high-speed motoring from relatively modest engine size and compact closed or berlinetta coachwork.
The 1947 Maserati A6 1500 two-seat berlinetta was the first production model from Maserati.
In Germany, the motor industry was devastated by the war, but a small number of manufacturers returned it to prominence.
In 1948, the Porsche 356 was released as the debut model from Porsche.
The significance of the Porsche 356 and its successors was described in 1957 as "future historians must see them as among the most important of mid-century production cars".
The 1954 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL is another significant car from this era.
The 1961 Jaguar E-Type is an iconic sports car of the early 1960s, due to its attractive styling and claimed top speed of 241 km/h (150 mph).
The E-type was produced for 14 years and was initially powered by a six-cylinder engine, followed by a V12 engine for the final generation.
In 1962, the MG B introduced a new era of affordable lightweight four-cylinder roadsters.
The MG B used a unibody construction and was produced until 1980.
Other successful lightweight roadsters include the Triumph Spitfire (1962-1980) and the Alfa Romeo Spider (1966-1993).
The Fiat X1/9 (1972-1989) was unusual for its use of a mid-engine design in an affordable roadster model.
A late entrant to the affordable roadster market was the 1975 Triumph TR7, however by the late 1970s the demand for this style of car was in decline, resulting in production ceasing in 1982.
The original Lotus Elan (1962-1975) two-seat coupe and roadster models are an early commercial success for the philosophy of achieving performance through minimizing weight and has been rated as one of the top 10 sports cars of the 1960s.
The Elan featured fibreglass bodies, a backbone chassis, and overhead camshaft engines.
A different style of roadster was the AC Cobra, released in 1962, which was fitted with V8 engines up to 7.0 L (427 cu in) in size by Shelby.
The Porsche 911 was released in 1964 and has remained in production since.
The 911 is notable for its use of the uncommon rear-engine design and the use of a flat-six engine.
Another successful rear-engine sports car was the original Alpine A110 (1961-1977), which was a successful rally car during the Group 4 era.
In 1965, the BMW New Class Coupes were released, leading to the BMW 6 Series which remains in production to this day.
The Lamborghini Miura (1966) and Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale (1967) mid-engined high-performance cars are often cited as the first supercars.
Other significant European models of the 1960s and 1970s which might be considered supercars today are the Ferrari 250 GTO (1962-1964), Ferrari 250 GT Lusso (1963-1964), Ferrari 275 GTB/4 (1966-1968), Maserati Ghibli (1967-1973), Ferrari Daytona (1968-1973), Dino 246 (1969-1974), De Tomaso Pantera (1971-1993), Ferrari 308 GTB (1975-1980) and BMW M1 (1978-1981).
In 1966, the Jensen FF became the first sports car to use all-wheel drive.
The Ford Capri is a 2+2 coupe that was produced from 1968 to 1986 and intended to be a smaller European equivalent of the Ford Mustang.
A main rival to the Capri was Opel Manta, which was produced from 1970 to 1988.
The 1973-1978 Lancia Stratos was a mid-engined two-seat coupe that was powered by a Ferrari V6 engine.
This was an unusual arrangement for a car used to compete in rallying, nonetheless it was very successful and won the World Rally Championship in 1974, 1975, and 1976.
The Lancia Montecarlo was produced from 1975 to 1981 and is a mid-engine two-seater, available as a coupé or a targa-top.
It was sold as Lancia Scorpion in the USA.
Its racing variant, Montecarlo Turbo, won the 1979 World Championship for Makes in its division and overall for 1980 World Championship for Makes and 1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes.
Montecarlo also won the 1980 Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft and Giro d'Italia automobilistico marathon.
The Montecarlo was a basis for the silhouette racing car, Lancia Rally 037.
In the 1970s, turbocharging began to be adopted by sports cars, such as the BMW 2002 Turbo in 1973, the first Porsche 911 Turbo in 1975, and the Saab 99 Turbo in 1978.
Turbocharging became increasingly popular in the 1980s, from relatively affordable coupes such as the 1980–1986 Renault Fuego and 1992–1996 Rover 220 Coupé Turbo, to expensive supercars such as the 1984-1987 Ferrari 288 GTO and 1987-1992 Ferrari F40.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several manufacturers developed supercars that competed for production car top speed records.
These cars included the 1986–1993 Porsche 959, 1991–1995 Bugatti EB 110, 1992–1994 Jaguar XJ220 and 1993–998 McLaren F1.
The 1980-1995 Audi Quattro was a pioneering all-wheel drive sports car.
The 1995 Porsche 911 Turbo (993) saw the 911 Turbo model switch to all-wheel drive, a drivetrain layout that the model uses to this day.
The BMW M3 was released in 1986 and has been produced for every generation since.
The 1993-1996 Mercedes-Benz W124 E36 AMG was the mass-produced AMG model.
Audi's equivalent division, called "RS", was launched in 1994 with the Audi RS 2 Avant.
Ford Europe withdrew from the sports car market at the end of 1986 when the Capri was discontinued after a production run of nearly two decades.
There was no direct successor, as Ford was concentrating on higher-performance versions of its hatchback and saloon models at the time.
In 1989, a new generation of Lotus Elan roadster was released which used a front-wheel drive layout, a controversial choice for a "purist" sports car.
The Elan sold poorly and was discontinued after three years.
The 1996 Lotus Elise, a mid-engined, rear-wheel drive roadster, was much more successful and remained in production until 2021.
Roadsters enjoyed a resurgence in the mid-1990s, including the 1989-present Mazda MX-5, the 1995-2002 BMW Z3 (succeeded by the 2002-2016 BMW Z4), the 1995-2002 MG F, the 1996–present Porsche Boxster and the 1998–present Audi TT.
The Honda S2000 roadster was introduced in 1999 for the 2000 model year and was noted for its high-revving 4-cylinder engine and its exceptionally high specific output of 125 horsepower per litre.
The 2000–2021 Lotus Exige was introduced as a coupe version of Elise.
Similarly, Porsche Cayman (987) was introduced in 2006 as the coupe equivalent to the Porsche Boxster roadster.
Lotus also expanded its model range with the 2009–2021 Lotus Evora, a larger four-seat coupe.
Audi's first mid-engined supercar is the 2006–present Audi R8.
Other sports cars of the 2000s were the 2005-2010 Alfa Romeo Brera/Spider, 2009-2015 Peugeot RCZ, and the 2008-2017 reintroduction of the Volkswagen Scirocco (a coupe based on the VW Golf platform).
Reflecting overall car industry trends, the mid-2010s saw naturally aspirated engines being replaced by turbocharged engines.
Ferrari's first regular production turbocharged engine was used in the 2014-2017 Ferrari California T, followed by the 2015-2019 Ferrari 488.
Similarly, in 2016, the Porsche 911 (991.2) began to use turbocharging on all models and the Porsche 982 Cayman/Boxster downsized from a six-cylinder engine to a turbocharged four-cylinder engine.
Also in the 2010s, dual-clutch transmissions became more widespread, causing manual transmissions to decline in sales and no longer be offered on some models.
Hybrid-electric sports cars began to appear in the 2010s— notably the 2013-2016 LaFerrari, 2013-2015 McLaren P1, 2013-2015 Porsche 918 Spyder "hypercars".
The 2014–2020 BMW i8 was also an early plug-in hybrid sports car.
McLaren began permanent car manufacturing operations with the 2011-2014 McLaren 12C.
In 2013, the Jaguar F-Type saw the brand return to the two-seat sports car market, with the four-seat grand tourer Jaguar XK discontinued the following year.
The BMW 2 Series coupe and convertible were introduced in 2013 to sit below the larger BMW 4 Series models, with the new BMW M2 high-performance model introduced in 2015.
The 2013–present Alfa Romeo 4C two-seat coupe and roadster used a carbon-fibre body and became Alfa's first mid-engine sports car since the 1967-1969 Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale.
Fiat had exited the roadster market with the end of Fiat Barchetta production in 2005.
The company resumed production of roadsters in 2016 with the Fiat 124 Spider, which is based on the Mazda MX-5.
In 2017, Renault revived the Alpine brand for the 2017–present Alpine A110 mid-engine coupe.
During the 1910s and 1920s, American manufacturers of smaller sports cars included Apperson, Kissel, Marion, Midland, National, Overland, Stoddard-Dayton and Thomas; manufacturers of larger sports cars included Chadwick, Mercer, Stutz Motor Company, and Simplex.
Since the 1960s, American performance cars have often been designed as muscle cars rather than sports cars.
However, several American two-seat sports cars have also been produced, such as the 1953–present Chevrolet Corvette, 1962-1967 Shelby Cobra, 1983-1988 Pontiac Fiero, 1991-2017 Dodge Viper, and 2005-2006 Ford GT.
The first Japanese sports car was the 1959-1960 Datsun 211, a two-seat roadster built on the chassis of a compact pickup truck and powered by a 1.0 L (60 cu in) engine.
Only 20 cars were built, and the 1963-1965 Datsun SP310— based on the chassis of a passenger sedan instead of a pickup truck— is often considered Datsun's first mass-production sports car.
Honda's first sports car was the 1963-1964 Honda S500, a two-seat roadster with independent suspension for all wheels and a 0.5 L (32 cu in) DOHC engine.
In 1965, Toyota joined the two-seat roadster market with the Toyota Sports 800.
Mazda is noted for its use of rotary engines, beginning in 1967 with the Mazda Cosmo.
The Cosmo was a two-seat coupe with a 0.9 L (55 cu in) rotary engine producing up to 97 kW (130 bhp).
Mazda continued to produce sports cars with rotary engines (sometimes turbocharged) until the Mazda RX-8 ended production in 2012.
The Toyota 2000GT, produced from 1967 to 1970, was an expensive two-seat coupe that greatly changed overseas perceptions of the Japanese automotive industry.
The 2000GT demonstrated that Japan was capable of producing high-end sports cars to rival the traditional European brands.
In 1969, Nissan introduced the Nissan Fairlady Z / Datsun 240Z two-seat coupe, powered by a 2.4 L (146 cu in) six-cylinder engine and described as providing similar performance to the Jaguar E-Type at a more affordable price.
The 240Z began the lineage of Nissan "Z cars" which continues through to today's Nissan Z (RZ34).
In 1974, Nissan expanded their coupe range with the Nissan Silvia 2+2 coupe, which was powered by a four-cylinder engine and produced until 2002.
Also in 1969, Mitsubishi's first performance car was introduced, in the form of the Mitsubishi Colt 11-F Super Sports coupe.
The 11-F Super Sports was followed by the 1970-1977 Mitsubishi Galant GTO and 1971-1975 Mitsubishi Galant FTO, both based on a platform shared with the Galant sedan.
Toyota's mass-production 2+2 coupes of the 1970s consisted of the Celica, Supra, Corolla Levin, and Sprinter Trueno.
The Celica was introduced in 1971 and remained in production until 2006.
From 1979 to 1986, the Supra name was used for six-cylinder versions of the Celica, until the Supra moved to a separate platform from 1986 to 2002.
The Corolla Levin / Sprinter Trueno were based on the Toyota Corolla hatchback platform and produced from 1972 to 2000.
The Nissan Skyline GT-R was initially produced as a sedan for two years before a coupe model was introduced in 1971.
This first generation Skyline GT-R had rear-wheel drive, a 2.0 L (122 cu in) six-cylinder engine, and was produced until 1972.
The Honda Prelude front-wheel drive 2+2 coupe was launched in 1978 and remained in production until 2001.
The 1985-2006 Honda Integra was also a front-wheel drive 2+2 coupe produced by Honda.
Other 2+2 models included the 1982-1989 Mitsubishi Starion (turbocharged and rear-wheel drive) and the 1985-1991 Subaru XT (available with a turbocharger and all-wheel drive).
Subaru has produced few sports cars in its history, instead focusing on rally-influenced sedans/hatchbacks for their performance models, such as the Liberty RS and Impreza WRX/STi models.
In 1984, the Toyota MR2 two-seat coupe became Japan's first production mid-engine car.
The MR2 switched to a two-seat roadster body style for the final generation from 1999 to 2007.
The first Korean coupe model was the 1988 Hyundai Scoupe, which used front-wheel drive and was based on the Excel hatchback.
The Scoupe was followed by 1996-2008 Hyundai Tiburon and 2011-2022 Hyundai Veloster.
In the 1990s, multiple Japanese automakers made flagship sports cars, such as the Toyota Supra, Nissan Skyline GT-R, Honda NSX, Mazda RX-7, and Mitsubishi 3000GT, which notably performed well against their European competition.
These automakers had a well-documented gentlemen's agreement to officially limit advertised power figures for these vehicles to a maximum of 276 hp (280 PS; 206 kW).
The Nissan Skyline GT-R was reintroduced in 1989-2002 (R32, R33, and R34 generations) which became famous for their use of turbocharging and all-wheel drive, which provided performance comparable with many more expensive sports cars.
The 1990-2005 Honda NSX is considered Japan's first supercar.
The NSX was praised for being more reliable and user-friendly than contemporary European supercars.
The Honda S2000 is an open top sports car that was manufactured from 1999 to 2009.
The S2000 is named for its engine displacement of two liters, carrying on in the tradition of the S500, S600, and S800 roadsters of the 1960s.
Its engine is notable for its high specific power output.
The Mitsubishi GTO coupe/convertible was introduced in 1990.
The base models used front-wheel drive and a naturally aspirated V6 engine, however all-wheel drive and a turbocharged V6 engine were also available.
To sit below the GTO in the model range, the Mitsubishi FTO front-wheel drive coupe was introduced in 1994.
Both the GTO and FTO were discontinued in 2000.
Suzuki's first sports car was the 1991-1998 Suzuki Cappuccino, a two-seat roadster kei car with rear-wheel drive and a turbocharged 0.7 L (43 cu in) engine.
From 2003 to 2012 Mazda produced the Mazda RX-8, a rear-wheel drive quad coupé powered by a 1.3 L Renesis twin-rotor engine.
Due to production constraints, lower demand, and environmental regulations, the viability of new Japanese sports cars began to decrease in the mid-2000s.
The latest generation (R35) of the Nissan Skyline GT-R started production in 2007 as the Nissan GT-R. It was noteworthy for offering supercar performance with sports car practicality.
The Lexus LFA supercar was released by Lexus in 2010, a two-seat front-engine coupe powered by a 4.8 L (293 cu in) V10 engine.
The Toyota 86 / Subaru BRZ is a 2+2 coupe that was introduced in 2012 and currently remains in production with a new model released for the 2022 model year.
The 86/BRZ is a rare modern example of a relatively affordable rear-wheel drive sports car.
The 2016–2022 Honda NSX (2nd generation) supercar marked a change in approach for Honda, by using all-wheel drive, a hybrid drivetrain, turbocharging, and a dual-clutch transmission.
Toyota relaunched the Supra nameplate in 2019 after a 17-year hiatus for the Toyota GR Supra front-engine, rear-wheel-drive coupe.
Nissan also released the new RZ34 generation of their Nissan Z in 2022.
A starter (also self-starter, cranking motor, or starter motor) is a device used to rotate (crank) an internal-combustion engine so as to initiate the engine's operation under its own power.
Starters can be electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic.
The starter can also be another internal-combustion engine in the case, for instance, of very large engines, or diesel engines in agricultural or excavation applications.
Internal combustion engines are feedback systems, which, once started, rely on the inertia from each cycle to initiate the next cycle.
In a four-stroke engine, the third stroke releases energy from the fuel, powering the fourth (exhaust) stroke and also the first two (intake, compression) strokes of the next cycle, as well as powering the engine's external load.
To start the first cycle at the beginning of any particular session, the first two strokes must be powered in some other way than from the engine itself.
The starter motor is used for this purpose and it is not required once the engine starts running and its feedback loop becomes self-sustaining.
Before the advent of the starter motor, engines were started by various methods including wind-up springs, gunpowder cylinders, and human-powered techniques such as a removable crank handle which engaged the front of the crankshaft, pulling on an airplane propeller, or pulling a cord that was wound around an open-face pulley.
The hand-crank method was commonly used to start engines, but it was inconvenient, difficult, and dangerous.
The behavior of an engine during starting is not always predictable.
The engine can kick back, causing sudden reverse rotation.
Many manual starters included a one-directional slip or release provision so that once engine rotation began, the starter would disengage from the engine.
In the event of a kickback, the reverse rotation of the engine could suddenly engage the starter, causing the crank to unexpectedly and violently jerk, possibly injuring the operator.
For cord-wound starters, a kickback could pull the operator towards the engine or machine, or swing the starter cord and handle at high speed around the starter pulley.
Even though cranks had an overrun mechanism, when the engine started, the crank could begin to spin along with the crankshaft and potentially strike the person cranking the engine.
Additionally, care had to be taken to retard the spark in order to prevent backfiring; with an advanced spark setting, the engine could kick back (run in reverse), pulling the crank with it, because the overrun safety mechanism works in one direction only.
Although users were advised to cup their fingers and thumb under the crank and pull up, it felt natural for operators to grasp the handle with the fingers on one side, the thumb on the other.
Even a simple backfire could result in a broken thumb; it was possible to end up with a broken wrist, a dislocated shoulder or worse.
Moreover, increasingly larger engines with higher compression ratios made hand cranking a more physically demanding endeavour.
The first electric starter was installed on an Arnold, an adaptation of the Benz Velo, built in 1896 in East Peckham, England, by electrical engineer H. J. Dowsing.
In 1903, Clyde J. Coleman invented and patented the first electric starter in America U.S. patent 0,745,157.
One aspect of the invention lay in the realization that a relatively small motor, driven with higher voltage and current than would be feasible for continuous operation, could deliver enough power to crank the engine for starting.
At the voltage and current levels required, such a motor would burn out in a few minutes of continuous operation, but not during the few seconds needed to start the engine.
The starters were first installed on the Cadillac Model Thirty in 1912, with the same system being adopted by Lanchester later that year.
These starters also worked as generators once the engine was running, a concept that is now being revived in hybrid vehicles.
Although the electric starter motor was to come to dominate the car market, in 1912, there were several competing types of starter, with the Adams, S.C.A.T. and Wolseley cars having direct air starters, and Sunbeam introducing an air starter motor with similar approach to that used for the Delco and Scott-Crossley electrical starter motors (i.e. engaging with a toothed ring on the flywheel).
The Star and Adler cars had spring motors (sometimes referred to as clockwork motors), which used the energy stored in a spring driving through a reduction gear.
If the car failed to start, the starter handle could be used to wind up the spring for a further attempt.
The Ford Model T relied on hand cranks until 1919; during the 1920s, electric starters became near-universal on most new cars, making it easier for women and elderly people to drive.
It was still common for cars to be supplied with starter handles into the 1960s, and this continued much later for some makes (e.g. Citroën 2CV until end of production in 1990).
In many cases, cranks were used for setting timing rather than starting the engine as growing displacements and compression ratios made this impractical.
Communist bloc cars such as Ladas often still sported crank-starting as late as the 1980s.
For the first examples of production German turbojet engines later in World War II, Norbert Riedel designed a small two-stroke, opposed-twin gasoline engine to start both the Junkers Jumo 004 and BMW 003 aircraft gas turbines as a form of auxiliary power unit to get the central spindle of each engine design rotating — these were usually installed at the very front of the turbojet, and were themselves started by a pull-rope to get them running during the startup procedure for the jet engines they were fitted to.
Before Chrysler's 1949 innovation of the key-operated combination ignition-starter switch, the starter was often operated by the driver pressing a button mounted on the floor or dashboard.
Some vehicles had a pedal in the floor that manually engaged the starter drive pinion with the flywheel ring gear, then completed the electrical circuit to the starter motor once the pedal reached the end of its travel.
Ferguson tractors from the 1940s, including the Ferguson TE20, had an extra position on the gear lever that engaged the starter switch, ensuring safety by preventing the tractors from being started in gear.
The electric starter motor or cranking motor is the most common type used on gasoline engines and small diesel engines.
The modern starter motor is either a permanent-magnet or a series-parallel wound direct current electric motor with a starter solenoid (similar to a relay) mounted on it.
When DC power from the starting battery is applied to the solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch (the "ignition switch"), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the drive pinion on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the starter ring gear on the flywheel of the engine.
The solenoid also closes high-current contacts for the starter motor, which begins to turn.
Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a spring in the solenoid assembly pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops.
The starter's pinion is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction.
In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key as soon as the engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft.
This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.
The sprag clutch arrangement would preclude the use of the starter as a generator if employed in the hybrid scheme mentioned above, unless modifications were made.
The standard starter motor is typically designed for intermittent use, which would preclude its use as a generator.
The starter's electrical components are designed only to operate for typically under 30 seconds before overheating (by too-slow dissipation of heat from ohmic losses), to save weight and cost.
Most automobile owner manuals instruct the operator to pause for at least ten seconds after each ten or fifteen seconds of cranking the engine, when trying to start an engine that does not start immediately.
This overrunning-clutch pinion arrangement was phased into use beginning in the early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used.
The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft.
When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the ring gear.
When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the ring gear.
This has the disadvantage that the gears will disengage if the engine fires briefly but does not continue to run.
An intermediate development between the Bendix drive developed in the 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive.
The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear as soon as the engine fired, even if it did not continue to run.
The Folo-Thru drive contains a latching mechanism and a set of flyweights in the body of the drive unit.
When the starter motor begins turning and the drive unit is forced forward on the helical shaft by inertia, it is latched into the engaged position.
Only once the drive unit is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is backdriven by the running engine) will the flyweights pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven drive unit to be spun out of engagement.
In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.
In 1962, Chrysler introduced a starter incorporating a geartrain between the motor and the drive shaft.
The motor shaft included integrally cut gear teeth forming a pinion that meshes with a larger adjacent driven gear to provide a gear reduction ratio of 3.75:1.
This permitted the use of a higher-speed, lower-current, lighter and more compact motor assembly while increasing cranking torque.
Variants of this starter design were used on most rear- and four-wheel-drive vehicles produced by Chrysler Corporation from 1962 through 1987.
It makes a unique, distinct sound when cranking the engine, which led to it being nicknamed the "Highland Park Hummingbird"—a reference to Chrysler's headquarters in Highland Park, Michigan.
The Chrysler gear-reduction starter formed the conceptual basis for the gear-reduction starters that now predominate in vehicles on the road.
Many Japanese automakers phased in gear reduction starters in the 1970s and 1980s.
Light aircraft engines also made extensive use of this kind of starter, because its light weight offered an advantage.
Those starters not employing offset gear trains like the Chrysler unit generally employ planetary epicyclic gear trains instead.
Direct-drive starters are almost entirely obsolete owing to their larger size, heavier weight and higher current requirements.
Ford issued a nonstandard starter, a direct-drive "movable pole shoe" design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits.
This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, replacing it with a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay.
This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch.
A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor.
One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil.
This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current to the rest of the starter motor winding.
Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.
This starter was used on Ford vehicles from 1973 through 1990, when a gear-reduction unit conceptually similar to the Chrysler unit replaced it.
A variant on the electric starter motor is the inertia starter (not to be confused with the Bendix-type starter described above).
Here the starter motor does not turn the engine directly.
Instead, when energized, the motor turns a heavy flywheel built into its casing (not the main flywheel of the engine).
Once the flywheel/motor unit has reached a constant speed the current to the motor is turned off and the drive between the motor and flywheel is disengaged by a freewheel mechanism.
The spinning flywheel is then connected to the main engine and its inertia turns it over to start it.
These stages are commonly automated by solenoid switches, with the machine operator using a two-position control switch, which is held in one position to spin the motor and then moved to the other to cut the current to the motor and engage the flywheel to the engine.
The advantage of the inertia starter is that, because the motor is not driving the engine directly, it can be of much lower power than the standard starter for an engine of the same size.
This allows for a motor of much lower weight and smaller size, as well as lighter cables and smaller batteries to power the motor.
This made the inertia starter a common choice for aircraft with large radial piston engines.
The disadvantage is the increased time required to start the engine - spinning up the flywheel to the required speed can take between 10 and 20 seconds.
If the engine does not start by the time the flywheel has lost its inertia then the process must be repeated for the next attempt.
Some gas turbine engines and diesel engines, particularly on trucks, use a pneumatic self-starter.
In ground vehicles the system consists of a geared turbine, an air compressor and a pressure tank.
Compressed air released from the tank is used to spin the turbine, and through a set of reduction gears, engages the ring gear on the flywheel, much like an electric starter.
The engine, once running, drives the compressor to recharge the tank.
Aircraft with large gas turbine engines are typically started using a large volume of low-pressure compressed air, supplied from a very small engine referred to as an auxiliary power unit, located elsewhere in the aircraft.
Alternatively, aircraft gas turbine engines can be rapidly started using a mobile ground-based pneumatic starting engine, referred to as a start cart or air start cart.
On larger diesel generators found in large shore installations and especially on ships, a pneumatic starting gear is used.
The air motor is normally powered by compressed air at pressures of 10–30 bar.
The air motor is made up of a center drum about the size of a soup can with four or more slots cut into it to allow for the vanes to be placed radially on the drum to form chambers around the drum.
The drum is offset inside a round casing so that the inlet air for starting is admitted at the area where the drum and vanes form a small chamber compared to the others.
The compressed air can only expand by rotating the drum, which allows the small chamber to become larger and puts another one of the cambers in the air inlet.
The air motor spins much too fast to be used directly on the flywheel of the engine; instead a large gearing reduction, such as a planetary gear, is used to lower the output speed.
A Bendix gear is used to engage the flywheel.
Since large trucks typically use air brakes, the system does double duty, supplying compressed air to the brake system.
Pneumatic starters have the advantages of delivering high torque, mechanical simplicity and reliability.
They eliminate the need for oversized, heavy storage batteries in prime mover electrical systems.
Large Diesel generators and almost all Diesel engines used as the prime mover of ships use compressed air acting directly on the cylinder head.
This is not ideal for smaller Diesels, as it provides too much cooling on starting.
Also, the cylinder head needs to have enough space to support an extra valve for the air start system.
The air start system is conceptually very similar to a distributor in a car.
There is an air distributor that is geared to the camshaft of the Diesel engine; on the top of the air distributor is a single lobe similar to what is found on a camshaft.
Arranged radially around this lobe are roller tip followers for every cylinder.
When the lobe of the air distributor hits one of the followers it will send an air signal that acts upon the back of the air start valve located in the cylinder head, causing it to open.
Compressed air is provided from a large reservoir that feeds into a header located along the engine.
As soon as the air start valve is opened, the compressed air is admitted and the engine will begin turning.
It can be used on two-cycle and four-cycle engines and on reversing engines.
On large two-stroke engines less than one revolution of the crankshaft is needed for starting.
Some diesel engines from six to 16 cylinders are started by means of a hydraulic motor.
Hydraulic starters and the associated systems provide a sparkless, reliable method of engine starting over a wide temperature range.
Typically hydraulic starters are found in applications such as remote generators, lifeboat propulsion engines, offshore fire pumping engines, and hydraulic fracturing rigs.
The system used to support the hydraulic starter includes valves, pumps, filters, a reservoir, and piston accumulators.
The operator can manually recharge the hydraulic system; this cannot readily be done with electric starting systems, so hydraulic starting systems are favored in applications wherein emergency starting is a requirement.
With various configurations, Hydraulic starters can be fitted on any engine.
Hydraulic starters employ the high efficiency of the axial piston motor concept, which provides high torque at any temperature or environment, and guarantees minimal wear of the engine ring gear and the pinion.
A spring starter uses potential energy stored in a spring wound up with a crank to start an engine without a battery or alternator.
Turning the crank moves the pinion into mesh with the engine's ring gear, then winds up the spring.
Pulling the release lever then applies the spring tension to the pinion, turning the ring gear to start the engine.
The pinion automatically disengages from the flywheel after operation.
Provision is also made to allow the engine to be slowly turned over by hand for engine maintenance.
This is achieved by operating the trip lever just after the pinion has engaged with the flywheel.
Subsequent turning of the winding handle during this operation will not load the starter.
Spring starters can be found in engine-generators and hydraulic power packs, and on lifeboat engines, with the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels.
Many Briggs & Stratton lawn mowers in the 1960s had hand-cranked spring starters.
Some modern gasoline engines with twelve or more cylinders always have at least one or more pistons at the beginning of its power stroke and are able to start by injecting fuel into that cylinder and igniting it.
The same procedure can be applied to engines with fewer cylinders, if the engine happens to be stopped at the correct position.
This is one way of starting an engine of a car with stop-start system.
A stressed member engine is a vehicle engine used as an active structural element of the chassis to transmit forces and torques, rather than being passively contained by the chassis with anti-vibration mounts.
Automotive engineers use the method for weight reduction and mass centralization in vehicles.
Applications are found in several vehicles where mass reduction is critical for performance reasons, usually after several iterations of conventional frame/chassis designs have been employed.
Stressed member engines was patented in 1900 by Joah ("John")
Carver Phelon and his nephew Harry Rayner.
and were pioneered at least as early as the 1916 Harley-Davidson 8-valve racer, and incorporated in the production Harley-Davidson Model W by 1919.
The technique was developed in the 20th century by Vincent and others, and by the end of the century was common feature of chassis built by Ducati, BMW and others.
In 2019, KTM Duke 790's engine is used as a stressed member.
Many mid-engine sport cars have used stressed engine design.
The 1967 Lotus 49 is credited for establishing a solution copied by "everyone" in Formula One.
This requirement is cited as a reason the rules committee changed from an inline-four to a V-6 configuration for the 2014 Formula One season.
The limited-production De Tomaso Vallelunga mid-engine car prototyped in 1963 used the engine as a stressed member.
In GM's Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Motors Model S and Roadster electric cars, the battery pack is a stressed member to increase rigidity.
The Fordson tractor Model F, designed during World War I, eliminated the frame to reduce cost of materials and assembly, and was probably influenced by the similar design of the 1913 Wallis Cub.
A steamroller (or steam roller) is a form of road roller – a type of heavy construction machinery used for leveling surfaces, such as roads or airfields – that is powered by a steam engine.
The leveling/flattening action is achieved through a combination of the size and weight of the vehicle and the rolls: the smooth wheels and the large cylinder or drum fitted in place of treaded road wheels.
The majority of steam rollers are outwardly similar to traction engines as many traction engine manufacturers later produced rollers based on their existing designs, and the patents owned by certain roller manufacturers tended to influence the general arrangements used by others.
The key difference between the two vehicles is that on a roller the main roll replaces the front wheels and axle that would be fitted to a traction engine, and the driving wheels are smooth-tired.
The word steamroller frequently refers to road rollers in general, regardless of the method of propulsion.
Before about 1850, the word steamroller meant a fixed machine for rolling and curving steel plates for boilers and ships.
From then on, it also meant a mobile device for flattening ground.
An early steamroller was patented by Louis Lemoine in France in 1859 and demonstrated sometime before February 1861.
In Britain, a 30-ton steamroller was designed in 1863 by William Clark and partner W.F. Batho.
Having failed to impress the British municipal road authorities it was transferred  to Kolkata where it continued to work.
The company Aveling and Porter was the first to successfully sell the product commercially and subsequently became the largest manufacturer in Britain.
In 1866 they produced a prototype roller with 3 foot-wide rollers fitted to the rear of a standard 12 nominal horsepower traction engine.
This experimental machine was described by local papers as 'the world's first steamroller' and it caused a public spectacle.
In 1867, the steam road roller was patented and the company began production of the first practical steam roller – the new machine's rollers were mounted at the front instead of the back
and it weighed in excess of 30 tons.
It was tested on the Military Road in Chatham, Star Hill in Rochester and in Hyde Park, London and the machine proved a huge success.
Within a year, they were being exported around the world, including to France, India and the United States.
A New York City chief engineer said of one of these, that "in one day's rolling at a cost of 10 dollars, as much work was accomplished as in two days' rolling with a 7 ton roller drawn by eight horses at a cost of 20 dollars a day."
The heavier rollers were found to be hard to handle and the weight of the machines was reduced to around 10 tons.
Aveling & Porter refined their product continuously over the following decades, introducing fully steerable front rollers and compound steam engines at the 1881 Royal Agricultural Show.
The move to asphalt for road construction resulted in the demand for steamrollers that could rapidly reverse so they could roll the tar while still hot.
Machines that could do this were introduced in the first decade of the 20th century.
Production ended around 1950.
The majority of rollers were of the same basic 3-roll configuration, gear-driven, with two large smooth wheels (rolls) at the back and a single wide roll at the front (in actuality, the wide roll usually consisted of two narrower rolls on the same axle, to make steering easier).
However, there was also a distinctive variant, the "tandem", which had two wide rolls, one front, one rear.
Those made by Robey & Co used their standard steam wagon engine and pistol boiler fitted in a girder frame with rolls and a chain drive to produce a quick-reversing roller suitable for modern road surfaces such as tarmacadam and bituminous asphalt.
A number of Robey & Co. tandem rollers were modified to make a further variant, the tri-tandem, which was a tandem with a third roll, mounted directly behind the rear one.
Robey supplied the parts, but the modification was undertaken by Goodes of Royston.
Ten tandem and two tri-tandem Robey rollers survive in preservation, and one of the tri-tandems is known to have been used to construct parts of the M1 motorway.
A variation of the basic configuration was the "convertible": an engine which could be either a steam roller or a traction engine and could be changed from one form to the other in a relatively short time – i.e., less than half a day.
Convertible engines were liked by local authorities, since the same machine could be used for haulage in the winter and road-mending in the summer.
Although most steam roller designs are derived from traction engines, and were manufactured by the same companies, there are a number of features that set them apart.
The most obvious difference is in the wheels.
Traction engines were generally built with large fabricated spoked steel wheels with wide rims.
Those intended for road use would have continuous solid rubber tyres bolted around the rims, to improve traction on tarmac.
Engines intended for agricultural use would have a series of strakes bolted diagonally across the rims, like the tread on a modern pneumatic tractor tyre, and the wheels were typically wider to spread the load more evenly.
Steam rollers, on the other hand, had smooth rear wheels and a roller at the front.
The roller consisted of a pair of adjacent wide cylinders supported at both ends.
This replaced the separate wheels and axle of a traction engine.
In the conventional arrangement, the front roller is mounted centrally, forward of the chimney.
In order to allow enough clearance from the boiler (and hence a larger front roll), the smokebox is extended forward substantially at the top to incorporate a support plate on which to mount the bearing for the roller assembly.
This gives the distinctive, hooded look to the front of a steam roller.
It also necessitates a different design of smokebox door – it has to hinge up or down, rather than opening sideways, due to the limited access available.
Access to the boiler tubes for cleaning is limited and the brush usually has to be inserted through the small gap between the top of the roll and the fork.
The front and rear rolls were usually fitted with scraper bars.
As the vehicle moved along, these removed any surface material that had become stuck to the roll, to prevent a build-up of material and ensure a flat finish was maintained.
Some steam rollers were fitted with a scarifier mounted on the tender box at the rear.
They could be swung down to road level and used to rip up the old surface before a road was remade.
Another accessory was a tar sprayer – a bar mounted on the back of the roller.
This was not a common fixture.
Britain was a major exporter of steam rollers over the years, with the firm of Aveling and Porter probably being the most famous and the most prolific.
Many other traction engine manufacturers built steam rollers, but after Aveling and Porter, the most popular were Marshall, Sons & Co., John Fowler & Co., and Wallis & Steevens.
In America, the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company was a large builder.
J. I. Case made a roller variant of their farm engines, but had a small market share.
Other nations had makers including the Czechs, Swiss, Swedes, Germans (notably Kemna) and Dutch which produced steam rollers.
In the UK, a number of companies owned fleets of steam rollers and contracted them out to local authorities.
Many were still in use into the 1960s, and part of the M1 motorway was made using steam rollers.
A few steam rollers were being used for road maintenance in the early 1970s, and this may go some way to explaining why diesel-powered rollers are still colloquially known as steam rollers today.
Many steam rollers are preserved in working order, and can be seen in operation during special live steam festivals, where operating scale models may also be displayed.
At some of the UK steam fairs and rallies, demonstrations of road building using the old techniques, tools and machines are re-enacted by 'Road Gangs' in authentic dress.
Steam rollers feature prominently in these demonstrations.
The annual Great Dorset Steam Fair has a section dedicated to road-making machinery, including a line-up of working steam rollers.
A number of steamrollers ended their working lives in children's playgrounds to provide something for children to play on.
Two popular American bands were named for steamrollers, Buffalo Springfield and Mannheim Steamroller.
British steeplejack and engineering enthusiast Fred Dibnah was known as a national institution in Great Britain for the conservation of steam rollers and traction engines.
The first engine he restored to working order was an Aveling & Porter steam roller, registration no. DM3079.
Built in 1912, it was a 10-ton slide-valve, single-cylinder, 4-shaft, road roller.
Originally named "Allison", after his first wife, Fred renamed the engine "Betsy" (his mother's name) following his divorce – Fred's view being "wives may change but your mother remains your mother!"
This roller was featured in many of Fred's early television programmes.
It may still be seen at steam rallies in Britain and was in steam at the Great Dorset Steam Fair in 2011.
In the Japanese manga and anime series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Dio the vampire infamously attempted to crush Jotaro by dropping a steamroller on top of him.
Author Terry Pratchett instructed his collaborator Neil Gaiman that anything Pratchett had been working on at the time of his death should be destroyed by a steamroller.
Pratchett's daughter and literary executor Rhianna Pratchett also stated that she had no desire to try to finish her father's work or continue the Discworld franchise without him.
Accordingly, Pratchett's assistant Rob Wilkins brought Pratchett's computer hard drive to the Great Dorset Steam Fair, where a steamroller was driven over it.
Two different steamrollers appear as prominent characters in the Thomas & Friends television series; George and Buster, both of whom are based on the Aveling-Barford R class design.
The steamroller has a strong symbolism of an irresistible, onward-pushing force.
The Imperial Russian Army was nicknamed "steamroller" during World War One, as it was huge in size, and Russia initiated the war with an offensive.
The "Russian Steamroller" is one of the personifications of Russia, along with the Russian bear, double-headed eagle and Mat Zemlya.
The straight engine (also called inline engine) is a configuration of multi-cylinder piston engine where all of the cylinders are arranged in a single row, rather than radially or in two or more cylinder banks.
A straight engine is easier to build than an equivalent flat engine or V engine, as it uses one cylinder head rather than two.
Inline engines are also narrower than flat engines or V engines; however, they are longer and can be taller.
The engine balance characteristics of a straight engine depend on the number of cylinders and the firing interval.
When a straight engine is mounted at an angle from the vertical it is called a slant engine.
Notable slant engines include the 1959-2000 Chrysler Slant-6 engine, 1961-63 Pontiac Trophy 4 engine and the 1968-1981 Triumph Slant-4 engine.
Some buses and diesel multiple unit trains take this concept further by mounting the engines horizontally (i.e. with a slant angle of 90 degrees).
This is used to reduce the height of the engine, so that it can be located under the floor of the train or bus.
The straight-three and straight-four configurations are the most common layouts for three- and four-cylinder engines respectively.
Straight-five engines are occasionally used, most recently by Audi and Volvo.
Straight-six engines were common prior to the 1990s, however most six-cylinder engines now use a V6 layout.
Similarly, straight-eight engines were popular in the 1920s to 1940s, however they were replaced by the more compact V8 layout.
Many straight engines have been produced for aircraft, particularly from the early years of aviation and through the interwar period leading up to the Second World War.
Straight engines were simpler and had low frontal area, reducing drag, and provided better cockpit visibility.
Straight sixes were especially popular in the First World War, and most German and Italian and some British aircraft used descendants of Daimler's pre-war inline six.
Prominent examples include the German Mercedes D.III and BMW IIIa, Italian Isotta Fraschini V.4 and British Siddeley Puma.
The British de Havilland Gipsy family of engines and their descendants included straight-four and straight-six upright and inverted air-cooled engines which were used on a wide range of smaller aircraft around the world, including on the Tiger Moth biplane, and helped made the configuration popular for light aircraft.
Menasco and Fairchild-Ranger in the United States, Renault in France, Walter in Czechoslovakia, and Hirth in Germany all built a similar range of engines which were popular in their respective markets.
The aviation use of term "inline engine" is used more broadly than for straight engines, since it also applies to other configurations where the cylinders are located in rows (e.g. V engines, W engines, H engines and horizontally opposed engines).
Some straight aircraft engines have used an inverted engine configuration, whereby the crankshaft is at the top of the engine and the pistons hang downwards from it.
Advantages of the inverted arrangement include a raised thrust line for improved clearance for the propeller, which either allows for the use of a larger, more efficient propeller, or for shorter undercarriage.
Since the thrust line is higher, the engine can be mounted lower in the airframe, improving visibility forward, which is no longer blocked by the cylinder heads.
It also allows for a simpler exhaust to keep gasses clear from the cockpit.
In motorcycling, the term "in-line" is sometimes used narrowly, for a straight engine mounted in line with the frame.
A two-cylinder straight engine mounted across the frame is sometimes called a parallel twin.
Other times, motorcycling experts treat the terms parallel, straight, and inline as equivalent, and use them interchangeably.
A phase of the engine's cycle (e.g. compression stroke, exhaust stroke), during which the piston travels from top to bottom or vice versa.
The type of power cycle used by a piston engine (e.g. two-stroke engine, four-stroke engine).
"Stroke length", the distance travelled by the piston during each cycle.
The stroke length, along with bore diameter, determines the engine's displacement.
Commonly used engine phases or strokes (i.e. those used in a four-stroke engine) are described below.
Other types of engines can have very different phases.
The induction stroke is the first phase in a four-stroke (e.g. Otto cycle or Diesel cycle) engine.
It involves the downward movement of the piston, creating a partial vacuum that draws an air-fuel mixture (or air alone, in the case of a direct injection engine) into the combustion chamber.
The mixture enters the cylinder through an intake valve at the top of the cylinder.
The compression stroke is the second of the four stages in a four-stroke engine.
In this stage, the air-fuel mixture (or air alone, in the case of a direct injection engine) is compressed to the top of the cylinder by the piston.
This is the result of the piston moving upwards, reducing the volume of the chamber.
Towards the end of this phase, the mixture is ignited, by a spark plug for petrol engines or by self-ignition for diesel engines.
The combustion stroke is the third phase, where the ignited air-fuel mixture expands and pushes the piston downwards.
The force created by this expansion is what creates an engine's power.
The exhaust stroke is the final phase in a four stroke engine.
In this phase, the piston moves upwards, squeezing out the gasses that were created during the combustion stroke.
The gasses exit the cylinder through an exhaust valve at the top of the cylinder.
At the end of this phase, the exhaust valve closes and the intake valve opens, which then closes to allow a fresh air-fuel mixture into the cylinder so the process can repeat itself.
The thermodynamic cycle used by a piston engine is often described by the number of strokes to complete a cycle.
The most common designs for engines are two-stroke and four-stroke.
Less common designs include one-stroke engines, five-stroke engines, six-stroke engines and two-and-four stroke engines.
A Granada, Spain-based company, INNengine invented an opposed-piston engine with four pistons on either side to make a total of eight.
Fixed rods hold together all pistons, and they share one combustion chamber.
These rods press against plates that have an oscillating wave-like design, allowing the rods to press and release the pistons in a synchronized, smooth process.
The engine, known as the e-REX creates 4 times more power events per revolution than a conventional 4 Stroke and twice more than a 2 Stroke.
Although the e-REX is called a one-stroke engine there is debate that says it is actually a two-stroke engine, it is called a one-stroke because each piston executes two strokes (i.e., compression/combustion and exhaust/intake) in half an engine revolution, then by INNengine's logic, two strokes multiplied by half a revolution is what gave it the Patented 1 Stroke name.
Two-stroke engines complete a power cycle every two strokes, which means a power cycle is completed with every crankshaft revolution.
Two-stroke engines are commonly used in (typically large) marine engines, outdoor power tools (e.g. lawnmowers and chainsaws) and motorcycles.
Four-stroke engines complete a power cycle every four strokes, which means a power cycle is completed every two crankshaft revolutions.
Most automotive engines are of a four-stroke design.
Five-stroke engines complete a power cycle every five strokes.
The engine only exists as a prototype.
Six-stroke engines complete a power cycle every six strokes, which means a power cycle is completed every three crankshaft revolutions.
The stroke length is how far the piston travels in the cylinder, which is determined by the cranks on the crankshaft.
Engine displacement is calculated by multiplying the cross-section area of the cylinder (determined by the bore) by the stroke length.
This number is multiplied by the number of cylinders in the engine, to determine the total displacement.
The term stroke can also apply to movement of the piston in a locomotive cylinder.
A stratified charge engine describes a certain type of internal combustion engine, usually spark ignition (SI) engine that can be used in trucks, automobiles, portable and stationary equipment.
The term "stratified charge" refers to the working fluids and fuel vapors entering the cylinder.
Usually the fuel is injected into the cylinder or enters as a fuel rich vapor where a spark or other means are used to initiate ignition where the fuel rich zone interacts with the air to promote complete combustion.
A stratified charge can allow for slightly higher compression ratios without "knock," and leaner air/fuel ratio than in conventional internal combustion engines.
Conventionally, a four-stroke (petrol or gasoline)
Otto cycle engine is fueled by drawing a mixture of air and fuel into the combustion chamber during the intake stroke.
This produces a homogeneous charge: a homogeneous mixture of air and fuel, which is ignited by a spark plug at a predetermined moment near the top of the compression stroke.
In a homogeneous charge system, the air/fuel ratio is kept very close to stoichiometric, meaning it contains the exact amount of air necessary for complete combustion of the fuel.
This gives stable combustion, but it places an upper limit on the engine's efficiency: any attempt to improve fuel economy by running a much leaner mixture (less fuel or more air) with a homogeneous charge results in slower combustion and a higher engine temperature; this impacts on power and emissions, notably increasing nitrogen oxides or NOx.
In simple terms a stratified charge engine creates a richer mixture of fuel near the spark and a leaner mixture throughout the rest of the combustion chamber.
The rich mixture ignites easily and in turn ignites the lean mixture throughout the rest of the chamber; ultimately allowing the engine to use a leaner mixture thus improving efficiency while ensuring complete combustion.
A higher mechanical compression ratio, or dynamic compression ratio with forced induction, can be used to improve thermodynamic efficiency.
Because fuel is not injected into the combustion chamber until just before the combustion is required to begin, there is little risk of pre-ignition or engine knock.
The engine can also run on a much leaner overall air/fuel ratio, using stratified charge, in which a small charge of a rich fuel mixture is ignited first and used to improve combustion of a larger charge of a lean fuel mixture.
Increased NOx formation, due to the presence of extremely lean zones.
These zones are not usually  present in a gasoline engine, because the air and fuel is better mixed.
Combustion can be problematic if a lean mixture is present at the spark plug.
However, fueling a petrol engine directly allows more fuel to be directed towards the spark-plug than elsewhere in the combustion-chamber.
This results in a stratified charge: one in which the air/fuel ratio is not homogeneous throughout the combustion-chamber, but varies in a controlled (and potentially quite complex) way across the volume of the cylinder.
Charge stratification can also be achieved where there is no 'in cylinder' stratification: the inlet mixture can be so lean that it is unable to be ignited by the limited energy provided by a conventional spark plug.
This exceptionally lean mixture can, however, be ignited by the use of a conventional mixture strength of 12-15:1, in the case of a petrol fuelled engine, being fed into a small combustion chamber adjacent to and connected to the main lean-mixture chamber.
The large flame front from this burning mixture is sufficient to combust the charge.
It can be seen from this method of charge stratification that the lean charge is 'burnt' and the engine utilising this form of stratification is no longer subject to ' knock' or uncontrolled combustion.
The fuel being burnt in the lean charge is therefore not 'knock' or octane restricted.
This type of stratification therefore can utilise a wide variety of fuels; the specific energy output being dependent only on the calorific value of the fuel.
A relatively rich air/fuel mixture is directed to the spark-plug using multi-hole injectors.
This mixture is sparked, giving a strong, even and predictable flame-front.
This in turn results in a high-quality combustion of the much weaker mixture elsewhere in the cylinder.
It is worth comparing contemporary directly fueled petrol engines with direct-injection diesel engines.
Petrol can burn faster than diesel fuel, allowing higher maximum engine speeds and thus greater maximum power for sporting engines.
Diesel fuel, on the other hand, has a higher energy density, and in combination with higher combustion pressures can deliver very strong torque and high thermodynamic efficiency for more "normal" road vehicles.
This comparison of 'burn' rates is a rather simplistic view.
Although petrol and diesel engines appear similar in operation, the two types operate on entirely different principles.
In earlier manufactured editions the external characteristics were obvious.
Most petrol engines were carbureted, sucking the fuel/air mixture into the engine, while the diesel only sucked in air and the fuel was directly injected at high pressure into the cylinder.
In the conventional four-stroke petrol engine the spark plug commences to ignite the mixture in the cylinder at up to forty degrees before top dead centre while the piston is still travelling up the bore.
Within this movement of the piston up the bore, controlled combustion of the mixture takes place and the maximum pressure occurs just after top dead centre, with the pressure diminishing as the piston travels down the bore.
i.e.  the  cylinder volume in relation to the cylinder pressure-time generation remains essentially constant over the combustion cycle.
Diesel engine operation on the other hand inhales and compresses air only by the motion of the piston moving to top dead centre.
At this point maximum cylinder pressure has been reached.
The fuel is now injected into the cylinder and the fuel ' burn' or expansion is started at this point by the high temperature of the, now compressed, air.
As the fuel burns it expands exerting pressure on the piston, which in turn develops torque at the crankshaft.
It can be seen that the diesel engine is operating at constant pressure.
As the gas expands the piston is also moving down the cylinder.
By this process the piston and subsequently the crank experiences a greater torque, which is also exerted over a longer time interval than its petrol equivalent.
The principle of injecting fuel directly into the combustion chamber at the moment at which combustion is required to start was first invented by George Brayton in 1887, but it has been used to good effect in petrol engines for a long time.
Brayton describes his invention as follows: "I have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder, or in a communicating firing chamber."
Another part reads "I have for the first time, so far as my knowledge extends, regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion".
This was the first engine to use a lean burn system to regulate engine speed / output.
In this manner the engine fired on every power stroke and speed / output was controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected.
Harry Ricardo first began working with the idea of a lean burn "stratified charge" engine in the early 1900s.
In the 1920s he made improvements on his earlier designs.
An early example of gasoline direct injection was the Hesselman engine invented by Swedish engineer Jonas Hesselman in 1925.
Hesselman engines used the ultra lean burn principle and injected the fuel in the end of the compression stroke and then ignited it with a spark plug, it was often started on gasoline and then switched over to run on diesel or kerosene.
The Texaco Controlled Combustion System (TCCS) was a multifuel system developed in the 1950s which closely resembled the Hesselman design.
The TCCS was tested in UPS delivery vans and was found to have an overall increase in economy of about 35%.
Honda's CVCC engine, released in the early 1970s models of Civic, then Accord and City later in the decade, is a form of stratified charge engine that had wide market acceptance for considerable time.
The CVCC system had conventional inlet and exhaust valves and a third, supplementary, inlet valve that charged an area around the spark plug.
The spark plug and CVCC inlet were isolated from the main cylinder by a perforated metal plate.
At ignition a series of flame fronts shot into the very lean main charge, through the perforations, ensuring complete ignition.
In the Honda City Turbo such engines produced a high power-to-weight ratio at engine speeds of 7,000 rpm and above.
Jaguar Cars in the 1980s developed the Jaguar V12 engine, H.E. (so called High Efficiency) version, which fit in the Jaguar XJ12 and Jaguar XJS models and used a stratified charge design called the 'May Fireball' in order to reduce the engine's very heavy fuel consumption..
The Vespa ET2 scooter had a 50 cc two-stroke engine in which air was admitted through the transfer port and a rich fuel mixture was injected into the cylinder near the spark plug just before ignition.
The injection system was purely mechanical, using a timed pumping cylinder and a non-return valve.
On its downward stroke it compresses the rich mixture to about 70 psi at which time the rising pressure raises a spring loaded poppet valve off its seat and the charge is squirted into the cylinder.
There it is aimed at the spark plug area and ignited.
The combustion pressure immediately shuts the spring-loaded poppet valve and from then on its (sic) just a "regular" stratified-charge ignition process with the flame front igniting those lean mixture areas in the cylinder.
Volkswagen currently uses stratified charge on its direct injection 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.8 and 2.0 litres TFSI (Turbo fuel stratified injection) gasoline engines, in combination with turbocharging.
Mercedes-Benz has been employing stratified charge engines with its Blue DIRECT system.
With the stratified-charge application, the 3.0L V-6 will continue to employ direct fuel injection, but the injectors have been redesigned to spray under higher pressure later in the intake stroke, just before compression, and the fuel is shaped to arrive in certain areas within the cylinder to optimize combustion.
This strategy makes for an air-fuel mix within the chamber that is much leaner than with a conventional homogeneous-charge system that fills the chamber more uniformly before combustion.
SAE International has published papers on experimental work with stratified charge engines.
Turbo fuel stratified injection (TFSI) is a trademark of the Volkswagen Group for a type of forced-aspiration ("turbo") engine where the fuel is pressure-injected straight into the combustion chamber in such a way as to create a stratified charge.
FSI  direct injection technology increases the torque and power of spark-ignition engines, makes them as much as 15 percent more economical and reduces exhaust emissions.
Carbon build up behind the intake valves.
Since fuel is directly injected inside the combustion chamber, it never gets a chance to wash any contaminants behind the valves.
This results in excessive carbon build up over time, hindering performance.
Some engines (like Toyota's Dynamic Force engines) combine direct injection with traditional multi port fuel injection to ameliorate this problem.
A steering wheel (also called a driving wheel, a hand wheel, or simply wheel) is a type of steering control in vehicles.
Steering wheels are used in most modern land vehicles, including all mass-production automobiles, buses, light and heavy trucks, as well as tractors and tanks.
The steering wheel is the part of the steering system that the driver manipulates; the rest of the steering system responds to such driver inputs.
This can be through direct mechanical contact as in recirculating ball or rack and pinion steering gears, without or with the assistance of hydraulic power steering, HPS, or as in some modern production cars with the help of computer-controlled motors, known as electric power steering.
Near the start of the 18th century, many sea vessels appeared using the ship's wheel design.
However, historians are unclear when that approach to steering was first used.
The first automobiles were steered with a tiller, but in 1894, Alfred Vacheron took part in the Paris–Rouen race with a Panhard 4 hp model which he had fitted with a steering wheel.
That is believed to be one of the earliest employments of the principle.
From 1898, the Panhard et Levassor cars were equipped as standard with steering wheels.
Charles Rolls introduced the first car in Britain fitted with a steering wheel when he imported a 6 hp Panhard from France in 1898.
Arthur Constantin Krebs replaced the tiller with an inclined steering wheel for the Panhard car he designed for the 1898 Paris–Amsterdam–Paris race which ran 7–13 July 1898.
In 1898, Thomas B. Jeffery and his son, Charles T. Jeffery, developed two advanced experimental cars featuring a front-mounted engine and a steering wheel mounted on the left-hand side.
However, the early automaker adopted a more "conventional" rear-engine and tiller-steering layout for its first mass-produced Ramblers in 1902.
The following year, the Rambler Model E was largely unchanged, except that it came equipped with a tiller early in the year that was changed to a steering wheel by the end of 1903.
By 1904, all Ramblers featured steering wheels.
Within a decade, the steering wheel had entirely replaced the tiller in automobiles.
At the insistence of Thomas B. Jeffery, the driver's position was also moved to the left-hand side of the car during the 1903 Rambler production.
Most other car makers began offering cars with left-hand drive in 1910.
Soon after, most cars in the U.S. converted to left-hand drive.
Steering wheels for passenger automobiles are generally circular.
They are mounted to the steering column by a hub connected to the outer ring of the steering wheel by one or more spokes (single spoke wheels being a relatively rare exception).
Other types of vehicles may use a modified circular design, a butterfly shape, or some other shape, such as a yoke.
On some Tesla models, the steering control is through a yoke rectangle shaped with rounded edges and two pistol grips.
The C8 Corvette includes a square-type steering wheel with rounded corners, described as a 'squircle'.
The objective of the flat bottom is to ease diver egress while the flattened top enhances the line of sight when driving.
General Motors applied for a U.S. patent for a modular steering control that can be updated with components or changed in shape ranging from a traditional circle to a yoke.
In countries where cars must drive on the left side of the road, the steering wheel is typically on the right side of the car (right-hand drive or RHD); the converse applies in countries where cars drive on the right side of the road (left-hand drive or LHD).
In addition to its use in steering, the steering wheel is the usual location for a button to activate the car's horn.
Modern automobiles may have other controls, such as cruise control, audio system, and telephone controls, as well as paddle-shifters, built into the steering wheel to minimize the extent to which the driver must take their hands off the wheel.
The steering wheels were rigid and mounted on non-collapsible steering columns.
This arrangement increased the risk of impaling the driver in case of a severe crash.
The first collapsible steering column was invented in 1934 but was never successfully marketed.
By 1956, Ford came out with a safety steering wheel that was set high above the post with spokes that would flex, but the column was still rigid.
In 1968, United States regulations (FMVSS Standard No. 204) were implemented concerning the acceptable rearward movement of the steering wheel in case of a crash.
Collapsible steering columns were required to meet that standard.
Before this invention, the Citroën DS incorporated a curved and off-center single-spoke steering wheel designed to deflect the driver from the steering column in case of a crash.
Power steering affords the driver reduced effort to steer the car.
Modern power steering has almost universally relied on a hydraulic system, although electrical systems are steadily replacing this technology.
Mechanical power steering systems were introduced, such as on 1953 Studebakers.
However, hydraulically assisted systems have prevailed.
While other methods of steering passenger cars have resulted from experiments, for example, the "wrist-twist" steering of the 1965 Mercury Park Lane concept car was controlled by two 5-inch (127 mm) rings, none have yet been deployed as successfully as the conventional large steering wheel.
Passenger automobile regulations implemented by the U.S. Department of Transportation required the locking of steering wheel rotation (or transmission locked in "park") to hinder motor vehicle theft; in most vehicles, this is accomplished when the ignition key is removed from the ignition lock.
See steering lock.
The driver's seat and steering wheel are centrally located on certain high-performance sports cars, such as the McLaren F1, and most single-seat racing cars.
As drivers may continuously have their hands on the steering wheel for many hours, these are designed with ergonomics in mind.
However, the most crucial concern is that the driver can effectively convey torque to the steering system, especially in vehicles without power steering or in the rare event of a loss of steering assist.
A typical design for circular steering wheels is a steel or magnesium rim with a plastic or rubberized grip molded over and around it.
Some drivers purchase vinyl or textile steering wheel covers to enhance grip and comfort or simply as decoration.
Another device used to make steering easier is the brodie knob.
A similar device in aircraft is the yoke.
Water vessels not steered from a stern-mounted tiller are directed with the ship's wheel, which may have inspired the concept of the steering wheel.
The steering wheel is better than other user interfaces and has persisted because driving requires precise feedback that is provided by a large interface.
Early Formula One cars used steering wheels taken directly from road cars.
They were normally made from wood.
Without interior cabin packaging constraints, they tended to be made as large a diameter as possible to reduce the effort needed to turn.
As cars grew progressively lower and driver's areas more compact throughout the 1960s and 1970s, steering wheels became smaller to fit into the interior space.
The number of spokes in the steering wheel has continuously changed.
Most early cars had four-spoke steering wheels.
A Banjo steering wheel was an option in early automobiles.
They predate power steering.
The wire spokes were a buffer or absorber between the driver's hands and the vibration transmitted from the road surfaces.
Most were three- or four-spokes made of four or five wires in each spoke, hence the name "Banjo".
Edward James Lobdell developed the original tilt wheel in the early 1900s.
A 7-position tilt wheel was introduced by the Saginaw Division of General Motors in 1963 for all passenger car divisions except Chevrolet which received the tilt wheel in 1964.
This tilt wheel was also supplied to the other U.S. automakers (except Ford).
Originally a luxury option on cars, the tilt function helps to adjust the steering wheel by moving the wheel through an arc in an up and down motion.
Tilt Steering Wheels rely upon a ratchet joint located in the steering column just below the steering wheel.
The wheel can be adjusted upward or downward by disengaging the ratchet lock while the steering column remains stationary below the joint.
Some designs place the pivot slightly forward along the column, allowing for a fair amount of vertical movement of the steering wheel with slight actual tilt.
In contrast, other designs place the pivot almost inside the steering wheel, allowing adjustment of the angle of the steering wheel with nearly no change in its height.
An adjustable steering column allows the steering wheel height to be adjusted with only a small, useful change in tilt.
Most of these systems work with compression locks or electric motors instead of ratchet mechanisms; the latter may be capable of moving to a memorized position when a given driver uses the car or automatically moving up and forward to ease egress.
Many pre-war British cars offered telescoping steering wheels that required loosening a locknut before adjustment, many using the Douglas ASW (Adjustable Steering Wheel).
In 1949, the Jaguar XK120 introduced a new steering wheel supplied by Bluemel that was driver-adjustable by loosening a sleeve around the column by hand.
The 1955-1957 Ford Thunderbird had a similar design with 3 inches (76 mm) of total travel.
In 1956, the travel was restricted to 2 inches (51 mm).
A patent was filed regarding a telescoping steering wheel in July 1942 by Bernard Maurer of the Saginaw Steering Gear Division of General Motors (now Nexteer Automotive).
Nevertheless, GM would not offer a telescoping wheel of their own until the debut of the optional telescopic wheel on the 1965 Corvette and Corvair, and the optional tilt/telescope wheel on 1965 Cadillacs.
The GM column was released by twisting a locking ring surrounding the center hub and offered a 3-inch (76 mm) range of adjustment.
A swing-away steering column was introduced in the 1961 Ford Thunderbird and made available on other Ford products during the 1960s.
The swing-away steering wheel allowed the steering wheel to move 9 inches (229 mm) to the right when the transmission selector was in the "park" position to make the driver's exit and entry easier.
A tilt-away wheel was introduced by Ford in 1967 after updates to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards requirements.
Though it was an update to the swing-away steering wheel, which did not meet updated safety standards, it offers limited movement but added convenience due to the automatic pop-over function over its predecessor.
Some steering wheels can be mounted on a detachable or a quick-release hub.
The steering wheel can be removed without using tools by pressing a button.
The system is often found in narrow-spaced racing cars to facilitate the driver getting in and out, as well as in other cars as an anti-theft device.
The quick-release connector is often brand-specific, with some makes being interchangeable.
The most common mounting pattern is 6×70 mm, which denotes a bolt circle pattern with six bolts placed along a circle 70 mm in diameter.
Other examples of common bolt patterns are 3×1.75 in (44.45 mm), 5×2.75 in (69.85 mm), 6×74 mm and 6×2.75 in (69.85 mm).
The quick release itself is often proprietary.
Turning the steering wheel while the vehicle is stationary is called dry steering.
It is generally advised to avoid dry steering as it strains the steering mechanism and causes undue wear to the tires.
The first button added to the steering wheel was a switch to activate the car's electric horn.
Traditionally located on the steering wheel hub or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring, which obviated the necessity of moving a hand away from the rim.
Electrical connections are made via a slip ring.
A further development, the Rim Blow steering wheel, integrated the horn switch into the steering wheel rim.
In 1966, Ford offered the Highway Pilot Speed Control option with steering wheel pad-mounted rocker switches, on its Thunderbird.
Uniquely, the Thunderbird also lightly applied the brakes and illuminated the stop lamps when the Retard was continuously depressed with the cruise control on, but not engaged.
In the 1990s, a proliferation of new buttons began to appear on automobile steering wheels.
Remote or alternate adjustments could include vehicle audio, telephone, and voice control navigation.
Scroll wheels or buttons are often used to set volume levels or page through menus and change radio stations or audio tracks.
These controls can use universal interfaces, wired or wirelessly.
Game controllers are available for arcade cabinets, personal computers, and console games that are designed to look and feel like a steering wheel and intended for use in racing games.
An early example is the Telstar Arcade, which featured a wheel in 1977 for use in the Road Race game that came packaged with it.
Some modern gaming wheels employ force feedback to simulate the tactile feedback a real driver feels from a steering wheel, as well as buttons to allow for more inputs.
Stanford University (officially Leland Stanford Junior University) is a private research university in Stanford, California.
It was founded in 1885 by railroad magnate Leland Stanford, the eighth governor of and then-incumbent senator from California, and his wife, Jane, in memory of their only child, Leland Jr.
The university admitted its first students in 1891, opening as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.
It struggled financially after Leland's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
Following World War II, university provost Frederick Terman inspired an entrepreneurial culture in order to build a self-sufficient local industry (Silicon Valley).
Stanford is one of the most successful universities worldwide in attracting funding for start-up companies and in also licensing its inventions to existing businesses.
Alumni have founded numerous corporations, which when combined equal the tenth-largest economy in the world.
In 1951, the Stanford Research Park was established in Palo Alto and is the world's first university research park.
By 2021, the university had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical faculty on staff.
The university is organized around seven schools of study on an 8,180-acre (3,310-hectare) campus, one of the largest in the nation.
It houses the Hoover Institution, a public policy think tank, and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".
Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Pac-12 Conference.
Stanford has won 131 NCAA team championships,  and was awarded the NACDA Directors' Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994.
Stanford students and alumni have also won over 302 Olympic medals (including 153 gold).
Stanford is also the alma mater of several world leaders, including President of the United States, Herbert Hoover, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak, Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and Prime Minister of Japan, Yukio Hatoyama.
The university is associated with 74 living billionaires, 58 Nobel laureates, 33 MacArthur Fellows, 29 Turing Award winners, as well as 7 Wolf Foundation Prize recipients and 4 Pulitzer Prize winners.
Additionally, it is a producer of Fulbright Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Gates Cambridge Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, and members of the United States Congress.
The university's law department, established as an undergraduate curriculum in 1893, was transitioned into a professional law school starting in 1908 and received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1923.
The Stanford University Graduate School of Education grew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education, one of the original twenty-one departments at Stanford, and became a professional graduate school in 1917.
The Stanford Graduate School of Business was founded in 1925 at the urging of then-trustee Herbert Hoover.
In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I.
The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.
In the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, an engineering professor who later became provost, encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products.
During the 1950s, he established Stanford Industrial Park, a high-tech commercial campus on university land.
Also in the 1950s, William Shockley, co-inventor of the silicon transistor, recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize for Physics, and later professor of physics at Stanford, moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory.
The next year, eight of his employees resigned and formed a competing company, Fairchild Semiconductor.
The presence of so many high-tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid-Peninsula as a hotbed of innovation, eventually named Silicon Valley after the key ingredient in transistors.
Shockley and Terman are both often described as the "fathers of Silicon Valley".
In the 1950s, Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions, and for decades, denied and dismissed claims from students, parents, and alumni that they were doing so.
Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in 2022 after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants, while also misleading those who expressed concerns, including students, parents, alumni, and the ADL.
Stanford was once considered a school for "the wealthy", but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation.
The 1971 Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical, and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school's research funding, and the resignation of President Donald Kennedy in 1992.
Moving the Stanford Medical School from a small, inadequate campus in San Francisco to a new facility on the Stanford campus which was fully integrated into the university to an unusual degree for medical schools.
Establishing the Stanford Industrial Park (now the Stanford Research Park) and the Stanford Shopping Center on leased University land, thus stabilizing the university's finances.
The Stanford Industrial Park, together with the university's aggressive pursuit of government research grants, helped to spur the development of Silicon Valley.
Increasing the number of students receiving financial aid from less than 5% when he took office to more than one-third when he retired.
Increasing the size of the student body from 8,300 to 11,300 and the size of the tenured faculty from 322 to 974.
Launching the PACE fundraising program, the largest such program ever undertaken by any university up to that time.
Launching a building boom on campus that included a new bookstore, post office, student union, dormitories, a faculty club, and many academic buildings.
Creating the Overseas Campus program for undergraduates in 1958.
Most of Stanford is on an 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2) campus, one of the largest in the United States.
It is on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast of San Francisco and approximately 20 miles (30 km) northwest of San Jose.
Stanford received $4.5 billion in 2006 and spent more than $2.1 billion in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties.
In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.
Stanford's main campus includes a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County, although some of the university land (such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto.
The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.
The central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander.
As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.
Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita to up to 8 feet of depth.
Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake, are on more remote sections of the founding grant.
The central academic campus is adjacent to Palo Alto, bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road, off State Route 82.
The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail.
It lies within area code 650.
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a 1,200-acre (490 ha) natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research.
Researchers and students are involved in biological research.
Professors can teach the importance of biological research to the biological community.
The primary goal is to understand the system of the natural Earth.
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy.
It contains the longest linear particle accelerator in the world, 2 miles (3.2 km) on a 426-acre (172 ha) area of land.
Hopkins Marine Station, in Pacific Grove, California, is a marine biology research center owned by the university since 1892.
Based on US Pacific Coast, it is one of the oldest marine laboratories.
It includes 10 research laboratories and is also used for archaeological exploration purposes.
A graduate student of the anthropology department discovered evidence that the location was home to a Chinese American fishing village in the early 1900s.
Redwood City campus for many of the university's administrative offices in Redwood City, California, a few miles north of the main campus.
In 2005, the university purchased a small, 35-acre (14 ha) campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices; development was delayed by the Great Recession.
In 2015, the university announced a development plan, and the Redwood City campus opened in March 2019.
The Bass Center in Washington, D.C. provides a base, including housing, for the Stanford in Washington program for undergraduates.
It includes a small art gallery open to the public.
Stanford Center at Peking University, housed in the Lee Jung Sen Building, is a small center for researchers and students in collaboration with Peking University.
Many Stanford faculty members live in the "Faculty Ghetto", within walking or biking distance of campus.
The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford.
Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold to other Stanford faculty but the land under the houses is leased for 51 years with the possibility of extensions.
Houses in the "Ghetto" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values.
Some of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park.
Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.
El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park, is also on Stanford land.
Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course, and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center, used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.
Contemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish.
Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
White Memorial Fountain (also known as "The Claw") between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of "fountain hopping"; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William White and John White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.
Stanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38.
Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.
A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.
The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).
The schools of Humanities and Sciences (twenty-seven departments), Engineering (nine departments), and Sustainability (nine departments) have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law, Medicine, Education, and Business have graduate programs only.
The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators.
But most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 54 elected representatives of the faculty for 2021.
The Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members.
Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body.
Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.
Since inception, the university has been the beneficiary of large donations.
The endowment began in 1885, six years before the opening of the university, when Leland Stanford and his wife Jane conveyed approximately $20 million to the university.
The university's pioneering of technology intellectual property transfer created both direct investments and enabled a unique pipeline of mega-donors including from alumni-founded companies with Google (Sergey Brin and Larry Page), Nike (Phil Knight), Hewlett-Packard (David Packard and Bill Hewlett),  and Sun Microsystems (Vinod Kohsla) as examples.
Further, the university's global reputation and continued leadership in  technology has attracted large donations from prominant figures such as the co-founder of Netscape (Jim Clark), founder of SAP SE (Hasso Plattner), co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz (Marc Andreessen and Laura Arillaga-Andreessen), chairman of Kleiner Perkins (John Doerr and his wife Ann).
among US universities.
Half of the applicants accepted to Stanford have an SAT score between 1440 and 1570 or an ACT score between 32 and 35.
Admissions officials consider a student's grade point average to be an important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.
In terms of non-academic materials as of 2019, Stanford ranks extracurricular activities, talent/ability and character/personal qualities as 'very important' in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking the interview, whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant, legacy preferences, volunteer work and work experience as 'considered'.
Of those students accepted to Stanford's Class of 2026, 1,736 chose to attend, of which 21% were first-generation college students.
Stanford's admission process is need-blind for U.S. citizens and permanent residents; while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411.
In 2012, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.
Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid.
Stanford has a no-loan policy.
For undergraduates admitted starting in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced.
Seventeen percent of students receive Pell Grants, a common measure of low-income students at a college.
In 2022, Stanford started its first dual-enrollment computer science program for high school students from low-income communities, as a pilot project which then inspired the founding of the Qualia Global Scholars Program.
Stanford plans to expand the program to include courses in Structured Liberal Education and writing.
Stanford follows a quarter system with the autumn quarter usually beginning in late September and the spring quarter ending in mid-June.
The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence.
Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges with the latest review in 2023.
Stanford is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity."
The university's research expenditure in fiscal years of 2021/22 was $1.82 billion and the total number of sponsored projects was 7,900.
By 2016, the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes.
Kathryn Ann Moler is the key person for leading those research centers for choosing problems, faculty members, and students.
Funding is also provided for undergraduate and graduate students by those labs, centers, and institutes for collaborative research.
Other Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution (a conservative think tank), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).
Stanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute, which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center.
It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean.
It focuses on five points: climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics.
Together with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the Biohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan.
This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.
By 2014, Stanford University Libraries (SUL) had twenty-four libraries in total.
The Hoover Institution Library and Archives is a research center based on history of 20th-century.
Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, and thousands of other digital resources.
The main library in the SU library system is the Green Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms.
Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East Asia collections with 540,000 volumes.
Stanford University Press, founded in 1892, published about 130 books per year has printed more than 3,000 books.
It also has fifteen subject areas.
The Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles, including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble.
Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors, the Stanford Shakespeare Company, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan.
Stanford is also host to ten a cappella groups, including the Mendicants (Stanford's first), Counterpoint (the first all-female group on the West Coast), the Harmonics, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers, Talisman, Everyday People, and Raagapella.
In 2022, Washington Monthly ranked Stanford at 1st position in their annual list of top universities in the United States.
In 2019, Stanford University took 1st place on Reuters' list of the World's Most Innovative Universities for the fifth consecutive year.
Stanford Graduate School of Business has consistently been both the most selective business school in the world and consistently ranked 1st in the list of best business schools year-over-year consecutively by various reputed studies including Bloomberg Businessweek and U.S. News & World Report for 2024.
Stanford Law School is also consistently been amongst the two most selective law schools in the world and consistently ranked 1st in the list of best law schools year-over-year consecutively for 2024 in U.S. News & World Report.
In a 2022 survey by The Princeton Review, Stanford was ranked 1st among the top ten "dream colleges" of America, and was considered to be the ultimate "dream college" of both students and parents.
From polls of college applicants done by The Princeton Review, every year from 2013 to 2020 the most commonly named "dream college" for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford their ultimate "dream college."
The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) ranked Stanford second in the world (after Harvard) most years from 2003 to 2020.
Times Higher Education recognizes Stanford as one of the world's "six super brands" on its World Reputation Rankings, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Oxford.
Biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) – Arthur Kornberg discovered the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for his work at Stanford.
By studying bacteria, Kornberg succeeded in isolating DNA polymerase in 1956–an enzyme that is active in the formation of DNA.
First Transgenic organism – Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were the first scientists to transplant genes from one living organism to another, a fundamental discovery for genetic engineering.
Thousands of products have been developed on the basis of their work, including human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.
Laser – Arthur Leonard Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work on lasers.
Nuclear magnetic resonance – Felix Bloch developed new methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements, which are the underlying principles of MRI.
ARPANET – Stanford Research Institute, formerly part of Stanford but on a separate campus, was the site of one of the four original ARPANET nodes.
In the early 1970s, Bob Kahn & Vint Cerf's research project about Internetworking, later DARPA formulated it to the TCP (Transmission Control Program).
Internet –
Stanford was the site where the original design of the Internet was undertaken.
Vint Cerf led a research group to elaborate the design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP) that he originally co-created with Robert E. Kahn (Bob Kahn) in 1973 and which formed the basis for the architecture of the Internet.
Frequency modulation synthesis – John Chowning of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to Yamaha Corporation.
Google – Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, when they were both PhD students at Stanford.
They were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP) which is started in 1999.
The SDLP's goal was "to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library", and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.
Today, Google stands as one of the most valuable brands in the world.
Klystron tube – invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford.
Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.
Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of U.S. and UK researchers working on radar equipment.
RISC – ARPA funded VLSI project of microprocessor design.
Stanford and UC Berkeley are most associated with the popularization of this concept.
The Stanford MIPS would go on to be commercialized as the successful MIPS architecture, while Berkeley RISC gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the SPARC.
Another success from this era were IBM's efforts that eventually led to the IBM POWER instruction set architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA.
As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the Unix workstation market as well as embedded processors in laser printers, routers and similar products.
SUN workstation – Andy Bechtolsheim designed the SUN workstation, for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation, which led to Sun Microsystems.
Stanford enrolled 6,996 undergraduate and 10,253 graduate students in the 2019–2020 school year.
Women made up 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students.
In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%.
Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master's degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018–2019 school year.
The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%.
The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or "coterm") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program.
In 2010, 15% of undergraduates were first-generation students.
By 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing.
First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years.
Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities.
At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as "temporary" housing from 1969 to 1991, but have become the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.
Most student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries.
Some are reserved for freshmen, sophomores, or upper-class students and some are open to all four classes.
Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House.
In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but some have single-gender floors.
These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces.
These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered.
Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy.
The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house), and Synergy.
Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.
By 2015, 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus.
Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.
In 2016, Stanford had sixteen male varsity sports and twenty female varsity sports, nineteen club sports, and about 27 intramural sports.
In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the executive committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot "Indian."
The Indian symbol and name were dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate.
The sports teams are now officially referred to as the "Stanford Cardinal," referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird.
Stanford is a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS.
The two official colors of the university are Stanford Cardinal Red and Palo Alto Green.
Its traditional sports rival is the University of California, Berkeley.
The winner of the annual "Big Game" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.
As of May 23, 2024, Stanford has won 136 NCAA team championships, more than any other school.
Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 48 consecutive years, from 1976–77 through to 2023–24.
As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have also won 529 NCAA individual championships.
No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total.
Stanford have won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994–1995 through to 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation.
177 Stanford-affiliated athletes have won a total of 296 Summer Olympic medals (150 gold, 79 silver, 67 bronze), including 26 medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 27 medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Stanford-affiliated athletes won 26 medals, more than any other university.
"Hail, Stanford, Hail!" is the Stanford hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various university singing groups.
It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in economics and later became associate professor of sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
The central football rivalry between Stanford and UC Berkeley.
First played in 1892, and for a time played by the universities' rugby teams, it is one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States.
The Stanford Axe: A trophy earned by the winner of Big Game, exchanged only as necessary.
The axe originated in 1899 when Stanford yell leader Billy Erb wielded a lumberman's axe to inspire the team.
Stanford lost, and the Axe was stolen by Berkeley students following the game.
In 1930, Stanford students staged an elaborate heist to recover the Axe.
In 1933, the schools agreed to exchange it as a prize for winning Big Game.
As of 2021, a restaurant centrally located on Stanford's campus is named "The Axe and Palm" in reference to the Axe.
Big Game Gaieties: In the week ahead of Big Game, a 90-minute original musical (written, composed, produced, and performed by the students of Ram's Head Theatrical Society) is performed in Memorial Auditorium.
Full Moon on the Quad: An annual event at Main Quad, where students gather to kiss one another starting at midnight.
Typically organized by the junior class cabinet, the festivities include live entertainment, such as music and dance performances.
The Stanford Marriage Pact: An annual matchmaking event where thousands of students complete a questionnaire about their values and are subsequently matched with the best person for them to make a "marriage pact" with.
Fountain Hopping: At any time of year, students tour Stanford's main campus fountains to dip their feet or swim in some of the university's 25 fountains.
Mausoleum Party: An annual Halloween party at the Stanford Mausoleum, the final resting place of Leland Stanford Jr. and his parents.
A 20-year tradition, the Mausoleum party was on hiatus from 2002 to 2005 due to a lack of funding, but was revived in 2006.
In 2008, it was hosted in Old Union rather than at the actual Mausoleum, because rain prohibited generators from being rented.
In 2009, after fundraising efforts by the Junior Class Presidents and the ASSU Executive, the event was able to return to the Mausoleum despite facing budget cuts earlier in the year.
Wacky Walk: At commencement, graduates forgo a more traditional entrance and instead stride into Stanford Stadium in a large procession wearing wacky costumes.
Steam Tunneling:
Stanford has a network of underground brick-lined tunnels that conduct central heating to more than 200 buildings via steam pipes.
Students sometimes navigate the corridors, rooms, and locked gates, carrying flashlights and water bottles.
Stanford Magazine named steam tunneling one of the "101 things you must do" before graduating from the Farm in 2000.
Band Run: An annual festivity at the beginning of the school year, where the band picks up freshmen from dorms across campus while stopping to perform at each location, culminating in a finale performance at Main Quad.
Viennese Ball:
A formal ball with waltzes that was initially started in the 1970s by students returning from the now-closed (since 1987)
Stanford in Vienna overseas program.
It is now open to all students.
The long-unofficial motto of Stanford, selected by President Jordan, is "Die Luft der Freiheit weht."
Translated from the German language, this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means, "The wind of freedom blows."
The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.
It was made official by way of incorporation into an official seal by the board of trustees in December 2002.
Degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman:
Stanford does not award honorary degrees, but in 1953 the "degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman" was created by Stanford Associates, part of the Stanford alumni organization, to recognize alumni who give rare and extraordinary service to the university.
It is awarded not at prescribed intervals, but instead only when the president of the university deems it appropriate to recognize extraordinary service.
Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.
Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.
Students and staff at Stanford are of many different religions.
The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is "to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds.
It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.
Stanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the "Protestant Ecumenical Christian" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life.
UPW sometimes has multifaith services.
In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and the other Christian denominations at Stanford.
Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and legal weddings.
In addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning, and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union.
It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life.
Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR.
The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Bahá’í, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.
The Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the "Windhover" paintings by Nathan Oliveira, the late Stanford professor and artist.
Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic and Hillel communities at Stanford.
Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891 when the university first opened.
In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.
However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.
Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.
Stanford has thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities.
Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university).
Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.
Stanford is home to two unhoused historically National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC or "Divine Nine") sororities (Alpha Kappa Alpha, and Delta Sigma Theta) and two unhoused NPHC fraternities (Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi).
These fraternities and sororities operate under the African American Fraternal Sororal Association (AAFSA) at Stanford.
Seven historically National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities, four of which are unhoused (Alpha Phi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Chi Omega, and Kappa Kappa Gamma) and three of which are housed (Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi) call Stanford home.
These sororities operate under the Stanford Inter-sorority Council (ISC).
Eleven historically National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including five unhoused fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Kappa Alpha Order), and four housed fraternities (Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma Nu).
These fraternities operate under the Stanford Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).
There are also four unhoused Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) sororities on campus (alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Lambda Theta Nu, Sigma Psi Zeta, and Sigma Theta Psi), as well as two unhoused MGC fraternities (Gamma Zeta Alpha and Lambda Phi Epsilon).
Lambda Phi Epsilon is recognized by the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC).
Stanford has more than 600 student organizations.
Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU.
These funds include "special fees," which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body.
Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations.
In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be "broadly open" for all interested students to join.
The Stanford Daily is a student-run daily newspaper and has been published since the university was founded in 1892.
The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.
The Stanford Review is a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987.

Stanford Pre Business Association is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities.
The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the Stanford Axe and the rest of the time assists the Stanford Band as a supplementary spirit group.
It has existed since 1982.
Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) which hosts the annual Stanford Powwow started in 1971.
This is the largest student-run event on campus and the largest student-run powwow in the country.
The Stanford Improvisors (SImps for short) teach and perform improvisational theatre on campus and in the surrounding community.
In 2014 the group finished second in the Golden Gate Regional College Improv tournament, and they have since been invited twice to perform at the annual San Francisco Improv Festival.
Asha for Education is a national student group founded in 1991.
It focuses mainly on education in India and supporting nonprofit organizations that work mainly in the education sector.
Asha's Stanford chapter organizes events like Holi as well as lectures by prominent leaders from India on the university campus.
Stanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus.
Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.
The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by the Clery Act.
Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976.
Murder is rare on the campus, although a few cases have been notorious, including the 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church, which was not solved until 2018.
Also infamous was Theodore Streleski's murder of his faculty advisor in 1978.
Associated Students of Stanford and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted.
Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from The Washington Post analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.
On the night of January 17–18, 2015, 22-year-old Chanel Miller, who was visiting the campus to attend a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity, was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a nineteen-year-old freshman student-athlete from Ohio.
Two Stanford graduate students witnessed the attack and intervened; when Turner attempted to flee the two held him down on the ground until police arrived.
Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered Miller counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.
Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.
The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.
Two years later, the judge in the case, Stanford graduate Aaron Persky, was recalled by the voters.
In February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.
Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course.
By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years.
Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015.
Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.
303 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Stanford's current and former faculty includes 58 Nobel laureates, as well as 29 winners of the Turing Award, the so-called "Nobel Prize in computer science", comprising one-third of the awards given in its 44-year history.
The university also has 27 ACM Fellows and is affiliated with four Gödel Prize winners, four Knuth Prize recipients, ten IJCAI Computers and Thought Award winners, and fifteen Grace Murray Hopper Award winners for their work in the foundations of computer science.
Stanford alumni have started many companies and, according to Forbes, Stanford has produced the second highest number of billionaires of all universities.
By 2022, 128 Stanford students or alumni have also been named Rhodes Scholars.
A station wagon (US, also wagon) or estate car (UK, also estate) is an automotive body-style variant of a sedan with its roof extended rearward over a shared passenger/cargo volume with access at the back via a third or fifth door (the liftgate, or tailgate), instead of a trunk/boot lid.
The body style transforms a standard three-box design into a two-box design—to include an A, B, and C-pillar, as well as a D-pillar.
Station wagons can flexibly reconfigure their interior volume via fold-down rear seats to prioritize either passenger or cargo volume.
Station wagons have evolved from their early use as specialized vehicles to carry people and luggage to and from a train station.
The demand for station wagon body style has faded since the 2010s in favor of the crossover or SUV designs.
Reflecting the original purpose of transporting people and luggage between country estates and train stations, The station wagon body style is called an "estate car" or "estate" in the United Kingdom or a "wagon" in Australia and New Zealand.
Either horse-drawn or automotive, the earliest use of the station wagon description would be considered to describe utility vehicles or light trucks.
The depot hackney or taxi, often on a Model T chassis with an exposed wood body, most often found around railroad stations, was the predecessor of the station wagon body style in the United States.
These early models with exposed wooden bodies became known as woodies.
By the 1920s the status of the station wagon description changed to consider them as vehicles for passengers.
In Germany, the term "Kombi" is used, which is short for Kombinationskraftwagen ("combination motor vehicle").
"Kombi" is also the term used in Poland.
Manufacturers may designate station wagons across various model lines with a proprietary nameplate for marketing and advertising differentiation.
Examples include "Avant", "Caravan", "Kombi", "Sports Tourer", "Sports Wagon", "Tourer", "Touring", and "Variant".
Station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration, a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo as well as a hatch or rear door (often called a tailgate in the case of a station wagon) that is hinged at roof level.
Folding rear seats designed to provide a larger space for cargo in place of passenger capacity, are also typical features for station wagons and hatchbacks.
D-pillar: Station wagons are more likely to have a D-pillar (hatchbacks and station wagons both have A-, B-, and C-pillars).
Cargo volume: Station wagons prioritize passenger and cargo volume—with windows beside the cargo volume.
Of the two body styles, a station wagon roof (viewed in profile) more likely extends to the very rearmost of the vehicle, enclosing a full-height cargo volume—a hatchback design (especially a liftback version) is likely to have steeply sloping roofline behind the B- or C-Pillar, prioritizing style over interior volume or cargo capacity, sometimes having a shorter rear overhang and smaller side windows (or no windows at all).
Cargo floor contour: A station wagon often has a fold-flat floor (for increased cargo capacity), whereas a hatchback is more likely to have a cargo floor with a pronounced contour.
Seating: Some station wagons have three rows of seats, whereas a hatchback will have two at most.
The rearmost row of seating in a station wagon is often located in the cargo area and can be front-facing, rear-facing, or side-facing.
Rear suspension: A station wagon may include a reconfigured rear suspension for additional load capacity and to minimize intrusion in the cargo volume.
It has become common for station wagons to use a platform shared with other body styles, resulting in many shared components (such as chassis, engine, transmission, bodywork forward of the A-pillar, interior features, and optional features) being used for the wagon, sedan, and hatchback variants of the model range.
Many modern station wagons have an upward-swinging, full-width, full-height rear door supported on gas springs—often where the rear window can swing up independently.
A variety of other designs have been employed in the past.
The split gate features an upward-swinging window and a downward-swinging tailgate, both manually operated.
This configuration was typical in the 1920s through the 1940s, and remained common on many models into the 1960s.
Side hinge: A side-hinged tailgate that opened like a door was offered on some three-seat station wagons to make it easier for the back-row passengers to enter and exit their rear-facing seats.
A station wagon design featuring a retractable rear roof section and a conventional rear tailgate with a window that rolled down and the gate opened down.
The sliding roof section allowed the carrying of tall objects in the rear cargo area.
This configuration appeared on the 1963–1966 Studebaker Wagonaire station wagon and the 1998-2009 GMC Envoy XUV SUV model.
Similar configurations became the standard feature on full-size and intermediate station wagons from General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, and American Motors Corporation (AMC).
Some full-size GM wagons added a notch in the rear bumper that acted as a step plate; a small portion of the bumper was attached to the tailgate to fill the gap.
When opened as a swinging door, this part of the bumper moved away, allowing the depression in the bumper to provide a "step" to ease entry; when the gate was opened by being lowered or raised to a closed position, the chrome section remained in place making the bumper "whole".
The GM design, as used in a Pontiac Grand Safari, with a forward-facing third-row seat and the clamshell tailgate, was less popular with consumers and was described as the "least convenient of all wagon arrangements" with difficult passenger egress and problematic tailgate operation in comparison to the 1974 AMC Ambassador, Dodge Monaco, and Mercury Colony Park, full-size station wagons conducted by Popular Science magazine.
Subsequent GM full-size wagons reverted to the door/gate system for its full-size wagons.
A simplified, one-piece lift-gate on smaller wagons.
The AMC Hornet Sportabout was introduced for the 1972 model year and featured a "liftgate-style hatchback instead of swing-out or fold-down tailgate ... would set a precedent for liftgates in modern SUVs."
The 1978-1996 GM's mid-size station wagons also returned to the upward-lifting rear window/gate as had been used in the 1940s.
Swing-up window: An upward-lifting, full-height, full-width rear door, where the window on the rear door can be opened independently from the rear door itself.
The window is also opened upwards and is held on pneumatic struts.
The Renault Laguna II station wagon and Ford Taurus wagon featured this arrangement.
Fold-up license plate: Wagons (including the Volvo Amazon wagon, early models of the Range Rover, and the Subaru Baja) had an upward folding hinged license plate attached to the lower tailgate of the split rear door.
When the tailgate was folded down, the plate hung down and remained readable.
The wagon versions of the Citroën DS, called the Break, Familiale, or Safari, had a different solution: two number plates were fitted to the tailgate at right angles to each other so one would be visible in either position.
Cargo barriers may be used to prevent unsecured cargo from causing injuries in the event of sudden deceleration, collision, or a rollover.
Performance models of station wagons have included the 1970 Ford Falcon (XY) 'Grand Sport' pack, the 1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS-454 and the 1992 BMW M5 (E34).
The 1994 Audi RS2, developed with Porsche, has been described as the world's first performance station wagon.
This was followed by the Audi RS4 and Audi RS6.
The 2006-2008 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 model brought together power and performance in a roomy station wagon.
Other German manufacturers have produced station wagon versions of their performance models, such as the Mercedes-AMG C63, Mercedes-AMG E63, BMW M5 (E60/E61), Volkswagen Golf R and Volkswagen Passat R36 wagons.
The Cadillac CTS-V Wagon introduced for the 2011 model year was considered the most potent production station wagon offered with a manual transmission, and the Corvette-engined version continued until 2014.
Manufacture of the wooden bodies was initially outsourced to custom coachbuilders, because the production of the all-wood bodies was very time-consuming.
Eventually, car manufacturers began producing their station wagon designs.
In 1922, the Essex Closed Coach became the first mass-produced car to use a steel body (in this case, a fully enclosed sedan body style).
In 1923, Star (a division of Durant Motors) became the first car company to offer a station wagon assembled on its production line (using a wooden wagon body shipped in from an outside supplier).
One of the first builders of wagon bodies was the Stoughton Wagon Company from Wisconsin, which began putting custom wagon bodies on the Ford Model T chassis in 1919 and by 1929 the Ford Motor Company was the biggest producer of chassis' for station wagons.
Since Ford owned its own hardwood forest and mills (at the Ford Iron Mountain Plant in what is today Kingsford, Michigan in Michigan's Upper Peninsula) it began supplying the wood components for the Model A station wagon.
Also in 1929, J.T. Cantrell began supplying woodie bodies for Chrysler vehicles, which continued until 1931.
By the 1930s, station wagons had become expensive and well-equipped vehicles.
When it was introduced in 1941, the Chrysler Town & Country was the most expensive car in the company's model range.
The first all-steel station wagon body style was the 1935 Chevrolet Suburban.
As part of the overall trend in the automotive industry, wooden bodies were superseded by all-steel bodies due to their strength, cost, and durability.
The commercial vehicle status was also reflected on those vehicles' registrations For example, there were special "Suburban" license plates in Pennsylvania used well into the 1960s, long after station wagons became car-based.
The first all-steel station wagon was the 1935 Chevrolet Suburban, which was built on the chassis of a panel truck.
However, most station wagons were produced with wooden bodies until after World War II.
When automobile production resumed after World War II, technological advances made all-steel station wagon bodies more practical, eliminating the cost, noise, and maintenance associated with wood bodies.
The first mass-produced steel-bodied station wagon was the 1946 Willys Station Wagon, based on the chassis of the Jeep CJ-2A. In 1947, Crosley introduced a steel-bodied station wagon version of the Crosley CC Four.
The first postwar station wagon to be based on a passenger car chassis was the 1949 Plymouth Suburban, which used a two-door body style.
Several manufacturers produced steel and wooden-bodied station wagons concurrently for several years.
For example, Plymouth continued the production of wooden-bodied station wagons until 1950.
The final wooden-bodied station built in the United States was the 1953 Buick Super Estate.
By 1951, most station wagons were being produced with all-steel bodies.
Station wagons experienced the highest production levels in the United States from the 1950s through the 1970s as a result of the American Mid-20th century baby boom.
The 1956 Rambler was an all-new design, and the 4-door "Cross Country" featured the industry's first station wagon hardtop.
However, the pillarless models could be expensive to produce, added wind noise, and created structural issues with body torque.
GM eliminated the pillarless wagon from its lineup in 1959, while AMC and Ford exited the field beginning with their 1960 and 1961 vehicles, leaving Chrysler and Dodge with the body style through the 1964 model year.
The CAFE standards provided an advantage to minivans (and later SUVs) over station wagons because the minivans and SUVs were classified as trucks in the United States and, therefore subject to less stringent fuel economy and emissions regulations.
Station wagons remained popular in Europe and in locations where emissions and efficiency regulations did not distinguish between cars and light trucks.
The emergence and popularity of SUVs, which closely approximate the traditional station wagon body style, was a blow.
After low sales, the Chevrolet Caprice and the Buick Roadmaster, the last American full-size wagons, were discontinued in 1996.
Smaller station wagons were marketed as lower-priced alternatives to SUVs and minivans.
Domestic wagons also remained in the Ford, Mercury, and Saturn lines.
However, after 2004, these compact station wagons also began to be phased out in the United States.
The Ford Taurus wagon was discontinued in 2005, and the Ford Focus station wagon was discontinued in 2008.
An exception to this trend was the Subaru Legacy and Subaru Outback station wagon models, which continue to be produced at the Subaru of Indiana plant.
With other brands, the niche previously occupied by station wagons is now primarily filled with a similar style of Crossover SUV, which generally has a car underpinning and a wagon body.
Imported station wagons, despite remaining popular in other countries, struggled in the United States.
European car manufacturers such as Audi, Volvo, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz continued to offer station wagons in their North American product ranges (marketed using the labels "Avant", "Touring", and "Estate" respectively).
However, these vehicles had fewer trim and power train levels than their sedan counterparts.
The Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG in Estate trim is a performance station wagon offered in the U.S. market.
The station wagon variants of the smaller Mercedes-Benz C-Class line-up were dropped in 2007, and the BMW 5 Series Touring models were discontinued in 2010 due to slow sales in the United States, with only 400 wagons sold in 2009.
In 2012, the Volvo V50 compact station wagon was withdrawn from the U.S. market due to poor sales.
The Cadillac CTS gave rise to a station wagon counterpart, the 2010 CTS Sportwagon, which defied the trend by offering almost as many trim levels as its sedan counterpart.
The CTS wagon, particularly in the performance CTS-V trim, received positive reviews until it was discontinued in 2014.
In 2011, the Toyota Prius V introduced hybrid power to the compact wagon market, but was discontinued in 2017 to streamline the Toyota hybrid lineup and focus on the RAV4 Hybrid Crossover SUV.
The 2015 VW Golf Sportwagen was marketed as a sub-compact station wagon in the North American market.
This model was withdrawn from the U.S. market after 2019.
In 2016, Volvo reintroduced a large wagon to the U.S. market with the Volvo V90, but only by special order.
Unique simulated wood designs included trim on the body pillars of the compact-size Nash Rambler station wagons that went up the roof's drip rail and around on the spit liftgate.
The larger-sized Cross Country station wagon was available with bodyside wood trim that went unbroken up the C and D pillars to a thin strip on the roof above the side windows.
Ford marketing began using “Country Squire” with the 1950 model year for the station wagon body design.<refMcGuire, Bob (30 July 2023).
"Ford's Flagship Wagons: The 1950-91 Country Squires".
macsmotorcitygarage.com.
Retrieved 26 April 2024.</ref> From 1950 through 1991, their simulated wood trim differentiated the Ford Country Squire station wagon models from the lower trim versions.
The "Squire" trim level was an available option in a few different Ford model ranges, including the Falcon Squire, Fairlane Squire, and the 1970s the Pinto Squire.
The Squire was the highest trim level of any Ford Wagon and included additional exterior and better interior trims.
Other woodie-style wagon models produced in significant numbers include the 1984 through 1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer that launched the luxury SUV market segment.
Simulated wood-grain trim differentiated the top level models of the 1957-1991 Mercury Colony Park, 1968–1988 Chrysler Town & Country, 1970–1990 Buick Estate, 1971–1992 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, and 1969–1972 Chevrolet Kingswood Estate.
From the 1950s until the 1990s, many full-size American station wagons could be optioned with a third row of seating in the cargo area (over the rear axle) for a total of nine seats.
Before 1956, the third-row seats were forward-facing.
Chrysler's 1957 models had a roof too low to permit a forward-facing seat in the cargo area, so a rear-facing seat was used for the third row.
General Motors adopted the rear-facing third row for most models during 1959-1971 and 1977–1996.
However, the 1964–1972 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser and 1964–1969 Buick Sport Wagon featured raised roof lines beginning above the second-row seat and continuing to the rear tailgate, resulting in the third row of seats being forward-facing.
General Motors also used forward-facing seats for the third row from 1971 through 1976 clam shell wagons.
The Ford and Mercury full-size wagons built after 1964 were available with four rows of seats, with the rear two rows in the cargo area facing each other.
The third and fourth rows were designed for two people each (although these seats were relatively narrow in later models), giving a total seating capacity of ten people.
The trend since the 1980s for smaller station wagon bodies has limited the seating to two rows, resulting in a total capacity of five people, or six people, if a bench front seat is used.
Since the 1990s, full-size station wagons have been largely replaced by SUVs with three-row seating, such as the Chevrolet Suburban, Ford Expedition, Dodge Durango, Land Rover Defender 130 and the Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class, and BMW X7.
The first two-door station wagon was the 1946 Willys Jeep Station Wagon.
Other early two-door station wagons were the 1951 Nash Rambler and the 1954 Studebaker Conestoga.
In 1956, Studebaker introduced three new two-door wagons in Pelham, Parkview, and Pinehurst trims.
General Motors began producing two-door station wagons in 1955 with the "Chevrolet Handyman" and the "Pontiac Chieftain".
General Motors also introduced the sportier Chevrolet Nomad and Pontiac Safari to their lineup in 1955.
Ford began production of steel-bodied two-door station wagons in 1952 with the Ford Ranch Wagon.
In 1956, Ford responded to the Nomad and Safari with the two-door wagon, the Ford Parklane.
This was a one-year-only model, succeeded by the Ford Del Rio in 1957.
After the merger of Nash and Hudson, the new company, American Motors (AMC), reintroduced the two-door wagon in the "new" Rambler American line in 1958.
It was "recycling" with only a few modifications from the original version and targeted buyers looking for "no-frills" economy.
American Motors' strategy of reintroducing an old design made for two distinct model runs, one of few examples where such a strategy has been successful for an automobile manufacturer.
The Chevrolet Vega Kammback, introduced in September 1970, was the first U.S.-made four-seat wagon and the first two-door wagon from GM in six years.
It shared its wheelbase and length with Vega coupe versions and was produced in the 1971–1977 model years.
The last two-door wagon available in America, the Geo Storm, was discontinued in 1993.
Early estate cars were after-market conversions, with the new bodywork using a wooden frame and either steel or wooden panels.
These wooden-bodied cars, produced until the 1960s, were among the most expensive vehicles.
Since the 1930s, the term shooting-brake (originally a term for hunting vehicles) has been an alternative, if now rarely used, to the term for estates in the UK.
Later, estates were produced by vehicle manufacturers and included the 1937 Commer (based on the Hillman Minx Magnificent) designed for "operators requiring reliable light transport units" and the chassis for the Supervan "multipurpose utility vehicle, primarily designed for estate transport ...
seating accommodation for five persons and the driver ... being quickly convertible to carry anything from hunting equipment to farm produce."
Others included the 1952 Morris Minor Traveller, 1952 Morris Oxford Traveller, 1954 Hillman Husky, 1954 Austin A30 Countryman and 1955 Ford Squire.
Most of these models were two-door estates, and several models were built on the chassis of relatively small cars.
Manufacturers often chose a specific model name to apply to all their estate cars as a marketing exercise - for example, Austin used the Countryman name, and Morris called it Traveller.
Some estates were closely derived from existing commercial van models, such as the Austin A30/35 Countryman and the Hillman Husky.
Others included the Austin Cambridge Countryman and the Standard Ten Companion.
Rover and Austin produced 4×4 canvas-topped utility vehicles in the 1950s that were available in estate body styles sold as "Station Wagons".
They incorporated better seating and trim than standard editions with options such as heaters.
Early advertising for the Land Rover version took the name literally, showing the vehicle collecting people and goods from a railway station.
Despite the popularity of station wagons in America, estate offerings in the U.K. from Ford and Vauxhall were limited to factory-approved aftermarket conversions of the Ford Consul and Vauxhall Cresta until the factory-built Vauxhall Victor wagon was introduced in 1958.
One of the smallest estates ever produced was the Morris Mini Traveller / Austin Mini Countryman, introduced in 1960.
Ford's first factory-built estate was the 1963 Ford Cortina.
The 1967 Hillman Husky station wagon version of the Hillman Imp was unusual in being a rear-engined estate.
Ford and Vauxhall produced factory-built estate variants of all three of their respective core models (small-, family- and large-size cars) by the 1970s.
The FD- and FE-Series Vauxhall Victors, built between 1966 and 1978, were large cars and featured estate models in the style of an American station wagon with front and rear bench seats and large-capacity petrol engines.
Other estates sold in the United Kingdom included the Morris 1100 (introduced in 1966), Vauxhall Viva (introduced 1967), Ford Escort (introduced in 1968), and Vauxhall Chevette (introduced 1976).
In the decades following, Vauxhall has produced the Astra family car from 1980 continuing till now in estate form, as well as other estate versions of larger cars such as the Cavalier, replaced in 1995 by the Vectra which itself was replaced in 2008 by the Insignia, staying in production till 2022.
The second generation Insignia was also made in Country Tourer form, a slightly raised crossover version of the standard Insignia Sports Tourer.
Between 1978 and 2003, they also sold estate versions of two executive cars, the Carlton and the Omega.
Vauxhall also produced the Signum in the mid-2000s as an executive take on a Vectra estate, and it was only available in such a body style; the Insignia VXR, a high-performance variant of the Insignia available in its first generation could also be had as an estate, with a V6 engine producing 321 bhp.
Jaguar produced the X-Type as an estate during the early 2000s, while the larger XF Sportbrake, produced from 2012, and the second generation, were available estate body style.
The first generation had a 'floating roof' appearance as its D-pillars were blended with the rear and side windows to make it look like glass.
The XFR-S was available with a 575 bhp (429 kW; 583 PS) 5.0 L supercharged V8, while the latter generation's most powerful engine was a 380 bhp (283 kW; 385 PS) 3.0 L supercharged V6.
The Mini Clubman, made from 2007 until now in Oxford, is an estate car made unique by having a split side-opening tailgate across both generations and a shooting brake body style in its first, with a small rearward-opening door on its right-hand side for ease of rear seat access.
The second generation could be bought in the high-performance John Cooper Works trim with up to 302 bhp.
MG marketed the MG5 EV - a rebadged Roewe Ei5, made in China - solely as an estate in the United Kingdom, the first estate since the brand's rebirth.
Previously, MG sold the ZT, a badge-engineered Rover 75.
This large family car also had the faster ZT-T version, a modified version of which, with over 800 bhp, gained the World's Fastest (non-production) Estate Car title in September 2003, with a top speed of 225.609 mph.
Before its discontinuation, Rover produced various estate cars: the aforementioned 75, also sold in V8 form, and the Rover 400 in the 1990s.
Germany is the largest market for station wagons in the world, with around 600,000 to 700,000 vehicles sold each year—amounting to 20% of all car sales.
German-designed station wagons have been produced by Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, and Volkswagen.
Some larger station wagon models are available with a third row of seats, such as the rear-facing jump seat for two passengers in the cargo area of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon.
In 1961, Volkswagen introduced the two-door "Variant" body style of the Volkswagen Type 3 (also known as the Volkswagen 1500—later the Volkswagen 1600).
The Type 3's rear-engine layout was retained for the station wagon models, but the engine profile was flattened, resulting in a small car offering interior room and trunk space in the front.
The model was offered through the 1973 model year.
Station wagons produced in East Germany include the 1956–1965 Wartburg 311/312/313, the 1963–1990 Trabant 601 Universal, and the 1966–1988 Wartburg 353 Tourist.
In France, almost all station wagon models are called a "Break".
The first station wagon produced by a French manufacturer was the Citroën Traction Avant Familiale model introduced in 1935.
The first Peugeot station wagon was the Peugeot 203, introduced in 1950.
In 1958, the Citroën ID Break (known as the Safari in English-speaking countries) was introduced, being larger than other French station wagon models and of similar size to the contemporary full-size station wagons from the United States.
It had a seating capacity of eight people, consisting of two front-facing bench seats and two folding inward-facing seats in the cargo area.
The 'Familiale' version had a front bench seat, a forward-facing three-space bench seat in the middle, and a folding forward-facing three-seat bench in the rear, providing a versatile nine-seat car.
The Citroën ID also had a two-part tailgate and a hydropneumatic suspension that allowed a self-leveling ride height and automatic brake biasing regardless of the load carried.
The car could also 'kneel' to the ground to facilitate loading heavy or large items.
The successors to the ID, the Citroën CX and Citroën XM, continued to be among the largest station wagon cars produced in Europe.
Nevertheless, the model was discontinued in 2000, and a station wagon version was unavailable for its Citroën C6 successor.
The Peugeot 404, introduced in 1960, offered a conventional large station wagon alternative to the innovative Citroëns.
Its replacement, the 505 was available in both five-seat and seven-seat 'Familiale' versions.
As with the Citroëns, changing demands in the French car market led to the end of the large Peugeot station wagon models in the mid-1990s, with the smaller Peugeot 406 becoming the largest station wagon model in the range from 1995.
In a similar situation to the United States, the decline of traditional Break and Familiale models in France was in no small part due to the introduction of the minivan in the form of the Renault Espace in 1984.
The first station wagon produced in Sweden was the Volvo Duett, introduced in 1953.
The Duett two-door wagon was conceived as a dual-function delivery van and people-carrier and is based on the chassis of the PV444 and PV544 sedans.
In 1962, the Volvo Duett was supplemented by a larger but lower Amazon, which has a four-door body and a horizontal split tailgate.
Volvo continued production of station wagons through the Volvo 145 (introduced in 1967), then the Volvo 200 Series (introduced in 1974), and the Volvo 700 Series (introduced in 1985).
In many markets, the station wagon models of the 700 Series significantly outsold the sedan models.
In 1990, the 700 Series was replaced by the Volvo 900 Series, which was sold alongside the smaller Volvo 850 wagon that was introduced one year later.
The 900 Series ended production in 1998, and its successor (the Volvo S80) did not include any wagon models.
Volvo station wagons produced since the mid-1990s are the Volvo V40, Volvo V50, Volvo V60, Volvo V70, and Volvo V90, with the V60 and V90 models currently in production.
Saab began producing station wagons in 1959, in the form of the Saab 95 two-door wagon, which was based on the Saab 93 sedan.
Following a hiatus in station wagon production since the Saab 95 ended production in 1978, the company introduced the four-door Saab 9-5 station wagon in 1997, which was produced until 2010.
In 2005 a 'Sportwagon' version of the Saab 9-3 was introduced and produced until 2011.
In 2017 station wagons accounted for 31% of all sold cars.
In 1983, station wagons represented 15% of the passenger car market, reflecting a trend throughout Europe of increasing popularity through the 1980s, with the vehicles becoming less cargo-oriented.
The first Japanese station wagon was the 1961 Isuzu Bellel four-door wagon, based on a compact sedan chassis.
This was followed by the 1963 Mazda Familia, 1966 Toyota Corolla, 1967 Isuzu Florian, 1969 Mitsubishi Galant, 1973 Mitsubishi Lancer and 1974 Honda Civic wagons.
However, Japanese manufacturers did not build station wagons in large volumes until the 1980s when the body style, along with SUVs and mInivans, boomed in popularity as leisure vehicles.
Models marketed as passenger station wagons in export markets were often sold as utilitarian "van" models in the home market.
Some were not updated in a model's life in Japan for consecutive generations.
For example, a sedan might have a model life of four years, but the wagon was not updated for up to eight years (such as the Toyota Corolla wagon built from 1979 until 1987 and the 1987–1996 Mazda Capella wagon).
Station wagons remain popular in Japan, although they are in slow decline as the SUVs and minivans have taken over a large portion of this market since the 2000s, with manufacturers replacing their station wagons with equivalent hatchbacks or crossover SUVs (i.e., Subaru replaced the wagon with the hatchback for their third-generation Impreza range).
Several Japanese compact MPVs such as Subaru Exiga and Toyota Prius α take elements from older station wagons while being more in line with their corresponding category.
South Korean manufacturers do not have a strong tradition of producing station wagons.
The first station wagon by the South Korean manufacturer was released way back in 1995 as the Hyundai Avante Touring (Lantra Sportswagon), followed in early 1996 as the Kia Pride station wagon.
Daewoo Motors followed suit a year later with the first-generation Nubira.
South Korean manufacturer Kia produces both the Cee'd and Optima station wagons designated as Sportswagons with sister company Hyundai offering station wagon versions of the i30 and i40.
The first Australian-designed car was built in 1948, but locally designed station wagons did not appear until nine years later when the 1957 Holden FE was introduced.
Holden's main competitor, the Ford Falcon (XK) introduced wagon models in 1960.
Ford and Holden produced wagon models based on each generation of their large sedan platforms until 2010.
Other wagons produced in Australia include the smaller Toyota Camry and Mitsubishi Magna.
The Ford and Holden wagons were usually built on a longer wheelbase than their sedan counterparts until the introduction of the Holden Commodore (VE), which switched to sharing the sedan's shorter wheelbase.
Ford ceased production of wagons in Australia when the Ford Falcon (BF) ended production in 2010, primarily due to the declining station wagon and large car market, but also following the 2004 introduction and sales success of the Ford Territory SUV.
Production of wagons in Australia ceased in 2017 when the Holden Commodore (VF) ended production.
A steam car is a car (automobile) propelled by a steam engine.
A steam engine is an external combustion engine (ECE), whereas the gasoline and diesel engines that eventually became standard are internal combustion engines (ICE).
ECEs have a lower thermal efficiency, but carbon monoxide production is more readily regulated.
The first experimental steam-powered cars were built in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it was not until after Richard Trevithick had developed the use of high-pressure steam around 1800 that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition.
By the 1850s there was a flurry of new steam car manufacturers.
Development was hampered by adverse legislation (the UK Locomotive Acts from the 1860s as well as the rapid development of internal combustion engine technology in the 1900s) leading to the commercial demise of steam-powered vehicles.
Relatively few remained in use after the Second World War.
Many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation.
The search for renewable energy sources has led to an occasional resurgence of interest in using steam technology to power road vehicles.
While gasoline-powered ICE cars have an operational thermal efficiency of 15% to 30%, early automotive steam units were capable of only about half this efficiency.
A significant benefit of the ECE is that the fuel burner can be configured for very low emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and unburned carbon in the exhaust, thus avoiding pollution.
The greatest technical challenges to the steam car have focused on its boiler.
This represents much of the total mass of the vehicle, making the car heavy (an internal combustion-engined car requires no boiler), and requires careful attention from the driver, although even the cars of 1900 had considerable automation to manage this.
The single largest restriction is the need to supply feedwater to the boiler.
This must either be carried and frequently replenished, or the car must also be fitted with a condenser, a further weight and inconvenience.
Steam-powered and electric cars outsold gasoline-powered cars in the United States prior to the invention of the electric starter, since internal combustion cars relied on a hand crank to start the engine, which was difficult and occasionally dangerous to use, as improper cranking could cause a backfire capable of breaking the arm of the operator.
Electric cars were popular to some extent, but had a short range, and could not be charged on the road if the batteries ran low.
Once working pressure was attained, early steam cars could be instantly driven off with high acceleration, but they typically take several minutes to start from cold, plus time to get the burner to operating temperature.
To overcome this, development has been directed toward flash boilers, which heat a much smaller quantity of water to get the vehicle started, and in the case of Doble cars, spark ignition diesel burners.
The steam car does have advantages over internal combustion-powered cars, although most of these are now less important than in the early 20th century.
The engine (excluding the boiler) is smaller and lighter than an internal combustion engine.
It is also better-suited to the speed and torque characteristics of the axle, thus avoiding the need for the heavy and complex transmission required for an internal combustion engine.
The steam car is also quieter, even without a silencer.
The first steam-powered vehicle was supposedly built in 1679 by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish Jesuit in China.
The vehicle was a toy for the Chinese Emperor.
While not intended to carry passengers and therefore not exactly a car but a carriage, Verbiest's device is likely to be the first ever engine powered vehicle.
Also it seems that the Belgian vehicle served as an inspiration for the Italian Grimaldi (early 1700) and the French Nolet (1748) steam carriage successor.
A French inventor, Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, built the first working self-propelled land based mechanical vehicle in two versions, one in 1769 and one in 1771 for use by the French Army.
William Murdoch built and operated a steam carriage in model form in 1784.
In 1791 he built a larger steam carriage which he had to abandon to do other work.
Also William Symington built a steam carriage in 1786.
There is an unsubstantiated story that a pair of Yorkshiremen, engineer Robert Fourness and his cousin, physician James Ashworth had a steam car running in 1788, after being granted a British patent No.1674 of December 1788.
An illustration of it even appeared in Hergé's book Tintin raconte l'histoire de l'automobile (Casterman, 1953).
The London Steam Carriage was built by Richard Trevithick in 1803 and ran successfully in London, but the venture failed to attract interest and soon folded up.
An amphibious steam car was built by Oliver Evans in 1805.
The first substantiated steam car for personal use was that of Josef Božek in 1815.
He was followed by Julius Griffith in 1821, Timothy Burstall and John Hill in 1824 and Thomas Blanchard in 1825.
Over thirty years passed before there was a flurry of steam cars from 1850s onwards with Dudgeon, Roper and Spencer from the United States, Leonard and Taylor from Canada, Rickett, Austin, Catley and Ayres from England, Bordino and Manzetti from Italy, others followed with Bollée and Lejeune from France, Thury from Switzerland and Kemna from Germany.
This early period also saw the first repossession of an automobile in 1867 and the first getaway car the same year, both by Francis Curtis of Newburyport, Massachusetts.
The 1880s saw the rise of the first larger scale manufacturers, particularly in France, the first being Bollée (1878) followed by De Dion-Bouton (1883), Whitney (1885), Olds (1886), Serpollet (1887) and Peugeot (1889).
The 1890s were dominated by the formation of numerous car manufacturing companies.
The internal combustion engine was in its infancy, whereas steam power was well established.
Electric powered cars were becoming available but suffered from their inability to travel longer distances.
Of all the new manufacturers from the 1890s, only four continued to make steam cars after 1910.
They were Stanley (to 1924) and Waverley (to 1916) of the United States, Buard of France (to 1914), and Miesse of Belgium (to 1926).
Assembly line mass production by Henry Ford dramatically reduced the cost of owning a conventional automobile, was also a strong factor in the steam car's demise as the Model T was both cheap and reliable.
Additionally, during the 'heyday' of steam cars, the internal combustion engine made steady gains in efficiency, matching and then surpassing the efficiency of a steam engine when the weight of a boiler is factored in.
With the introduction of the electric starter, the internal combustion engine became more popular than steam, but the internal combustion engine was not necessarily superior in performance, range, fuel economy and emissions.
Some steam enthusiasts feel steam has not received its share of attention in the field of automobile efficiency.
Apart from Brooks of Canada, all the steam car manufacturers that commenced between 1916 and 1926 were in the United States.
Endurance (1924-1925) was the last steam car manufacturer to commence operations.
American/Derr continued retrofitting production cars of various makes with steam engines, and Doble was the last steam car manufacturer.
It ceased business in 1930.
From the 1940s onward, various steam cars were constructed, usually by enthusiasts.
Among those mentioned were Charles Keen, Cal Williams' 1950 Ford Conversion, Forrest R Detrick's 1957 Detrick S-101 prototype, and Harry Peterson's Stanley powered Peterson.
The Detrick was constructed by Detrick, William H Mehrling, and Lee Gaeke who designed the engine based on a Stanley.
Charles Keen began constructing a steam car in 1940 with the intention of restarting steam car manufacturing.
Keen's family had a long history of involvement with steam propulsion going back to his great-great-grandfather in the 1830s, who helped build early steam locomotives.
His first car, a Plymouth Coupe, used a Stanley engine.
In 1948 and 1949, Keen employed Abner Doble to create a more powerful steam engine, a V4.
He used this in La Dawri Victress S4 bodied sports car.
Both these cars are still in existence.
Keen died in 1969 before completing a further car.
His papers and patterns were destroyed at that time.
In the 1950s, the only manufacturer to investigate steam cars was Paxton.
Abner Doble developed the Doble Ultimax engine for the Paxton Phoenix steam car, built by the Paxton Engineering Division of McCulloch Motors Corporation, Los Angeles.
The engine's sustained maximum power was 120 bhp (89 kW).
A Ford Coupe was used as a test-bed for the engine.
The project was eventually dropped in 1954.
In 1957, Williams Engine Company Incorporated of Ambler began offering steam engine conversions for existing production cars.
When air pollution became a significant issue for California in the mid-1960s the state encouraged investigation into the use of steam-powered cars.
The fuel crises of the early 1970s prompted further work.
None of this resulted in renewed steam car manufacturing.
Steam cars remain the domain of enthusiasts, occasional experimentation by manufacturers, and those wishing to establish steam-powered land speed records.
In 1967, California established the California Air Resources Board and began to implement legislation to dramatically reduce exhaust emissions.
This prompted renewed interest in alternative fuels for motor vehicles and a resurgence of interest in steam-powered cars in the state.
The idea for having patrol cars fitted with steam engines stemmed from an informal meeting in March 1968 of members of the California Assembly Transportation Committee.
In the discussion, Karsten Vieg, a lawyer attached to the Committee, suggested that six cars be fitted with steam engines for testing by California District Police Chiefs.
A bill was passed by the legislature to fund the trial.
In 1969, the California Highway Patrol initiated the project under Inspector David S. Luethje to investigate the feasibility of using steam engined cars.
Initially General Motors had agreed to pay a selected vendor $20,000 ($182,754 in 2023 dollars) toward the cost of developing a Rankine cycle engine, and up to $100,000 ($913,772 in 2023 dollars) for outfitting six Oldsmobile Delmont 88s as operational patrol vehicles.
This deal fell through because the engine manufacturers rejected GM's offer.
The plan was revised and two 1969 Dodge Polaras were to be retrofitted with steam engines for testing.
One car was to be modified by Don Johnson of Thermodynamic Systems Inc. and the other by industrialist William P. Lear's Lear Motors Incorporated.
At the time, the California State Legislature was introducing strict pollution control regulations for automobiles and the Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee, John Francis Foran, was supportive of the idea.
The Committee also was proposing to test four steam-powered buses in the San Francisco Bay Area that year.
Instead of a Polara, Thermodynamic Systems (later called General Steam Corp), was given a late-model Oldsmobile Delmont 88.
Lear was given a Polara but it does not appear to have been built.
Both firms were given 6 months to complete their projects with Lear's being due for completion on August 1, 1969.
Neither car had been completed by the due date and in November 1969, Lear was reported as saying the car would be ready in 3 months.
Lear's only known retrofit was a Chevrolet Monte Carlo unrelated to the project.
As for the project, it seems to have never been completed, with Lear pulling out by December.
In 1969, the National Air Pollution Control Administration announced a competition for a contract to design a practical passenger-car steam engine.
Five firms entered.
They were the consortium of Planning Research Corporation and STP Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio, Continental Motors Corporation, Detroit, Vought Aeronautical Division of Ling-Temco-Vought, Dallas and Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts.
General Motors introduced two experimental steam-powered cars in 1969.
One was the SE 124 based on a converted Chevrolet Chevelle and the other was designated SE 101 based on the Pontiac Grand Prix.
The SE 124 had its standard gasoline engine replaced with a 50 hp Besler steam engine V4, using the 1920 Doble patents, the SE 101 was fitted with a 160 hp steam engine developed by GM Engineering.
Power was transferred via a Toric automatic gearbox.
The results was disappointing.
The steam engine was heavy and weighted 300 kg more than a standard V8 and gave about half the power.
In October 1969, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology put out a challenge for a race August 1970 from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Pasadena, California for any college that wanted to participate in.
The race was open for electric, steam, turbine power, and internal combustion engines: liquid-fueled, gaseous-fueled engines, and hybrids.
Two steam-powered cars entered the race.
University of California, San Diego's modified AMC Javelin and Worcester Polytechnic Institute's converted 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle called the tea kettle.
Both dropped out on the second day of the race.
The California Assembly passed legislation in 1972 to contract two companies to develop steam-powered cars.
They were Aerojet Liquid Rocket Company of Sacramento and Steam Power Systems of San Diego.
Aerojet installed a steam turbine into a Chevrolet Vega, while Steam Power Systems built the Dutcher, a car named after the company's founder, Cornelius Dutcher.
Both cars were tested by 1974 but neither car went into production.
The Dutcher is on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.
Both Johnson and Lear had contemplated constructing steam-powered cars for the Indianapolis 500, Johnson first in the early 1960s when with Controlled Steam Dynamics and in 1968 with Thermodynamic Systems and Lear in 1969.
A third steam racing car was contemplated by a consortium of Planning Research Corporation and Andy Granatelli of STP Corporation.
Lear proceeded with the idea and constructed a car, but ran out of funds while trying to develop the engine.
The car is thought to be at the National Automobile and Truck Museum of the United States in Auburn, Indiana.
Johnson was also noted as working on a steam-powered helicopter.
William D Thompson, 69-year-old retired San Diego automotive engineer, also announced he planned to enter a steam-powered race car.
Thompson was working on a $35,000 ($290,799 in 2023 dollars) steam-powered luxury car and he intended to use the car's engine in the race car.
He had claimed that he had almost 250 orders for his cars.
By comparison, Rolls-Royces cost about $17,000 ($141,245 in 2023 dollars) at that time.
With Lear pulling out of attempting to make a steam car, Donald Healey decided to make a basic steam car technology more in line with Stanley or Doble and aimed at enthusiasts.
He planned to have the car in production by 1971.
Edward Pritchard created a steam-powered 1963 model Ford Falcon in 1972.
It was evaluated by the Australian Federal Government and was also taken to the United States for promotional purposes.
As a result of the 1973 oil crisis, SAAB started a project in 1974 codenamed ULF (short for utan luftföroreningar, Swedish for Without Air Pollution)) headed by Dr. Ove Platell which made a prototype steam-powered car.
The engine used an electronically controlled 28-pound multi-parallel-circuit steam generator with 1-millimeter-bore tubing and 16 gallons per hour (61 L/h) firing rate which was intended to produce 160 hp (119 kW) of continuous power, and was about the same size as a standard car battery.
Lengthy start-up times were avoided by using air compressed and stored when the car was running to power the car upon starting until adequate steam pressure was built up.
The engine used a conical rotary valve made from pure boron nitride.
To conserve water, a hermetically sealed water system was used.
The project was cancelled and the project engineer, Ove Platell, started a company named Ranotor, with his son Peter Platell to continue its development.
Ranotor is developing a steam hybrid that uses the exhaust heat from an ordinary petrol engine to power a small steam engine, with the aim of reducing fuel consumption by 20%.
In 2008, truck manufacturers Scania and Volvo were said to be interested in the project.
In 1974, the British designer Peter Pellandine produced the first Pelland Steamer for a contract with the South Australian Government.
It had a fiberglass monocoque chassis (based on the internal combustion-engined Pelland Sports) and used a twin cylinder double acting compound engine.
It has been preserved at the National Motor Museum at Birdwood, South Australia.
In 1977, the Pelland Mk II Steam Car was built, this time by Pelland Engineering in the UK.
It had a three cylinder double-acting engine in a 'broad-arrow' configuration, mounted in a tubular steel chassis with a Kevlar body, giving a gross weight of just 1,050 lb (476 kg).
Uncomplicated and robust, the steam engine was claimed to give trouble-free, efficient performance.
It had huge torque (1,100 ft⋅lbf or 1,500 N⋅m) at zero engine revs, and could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in under 8 seconds.
Pellandine made several attempts to break the land speed record for steam power, but was thwarted by technical issues.
Pellandine moved back to Australia in the 1990s where he continued to develop the Steamer.
The latest version is the Mark IV.
From 1996, a R&D subsidiary of the Volkswagen group called Enginion AG was developing a system called ZEE (Zero Emissions Engine).
It produced steam almost instantly without an open flame, and took 30 seconds to reach maximum power from a cold start.
Their third prototype, EZEE03, was a three cylinder unit meant to fit in a Škoda Fabia automobile.
The EZEE03 was described as having a "two-stroke" (i.e. single-acting) engine of 1,000 cc (61 cu in) displacement, producing up to 220 hp (164 kW) (500 N⋅m or 369 ft⋅lbf).
Exhaust emissions were said to be far below the SULEV standard.
It had an oilless engine with ceramic cylinder linings using steam instead of oil as a lubricant.
However, Enginion found that the market was not ready for steam cars, so they opted instead to develop the Steamcell power generator/heating system based on similar technology.
In 1892, painter Jöns Cederholm and his brother, André, a blacksmith, designed their first steam car, a two seater, introducing a condenser in 1894.
They planned to use it for transportation between their home in Ystad and their summer house outside town.
Unfortunately the automobile was destroyed in Sweden's first automobile accident but the Cederholm brothers soon built a second, improved version of their steam car reusing many parts from the first one.
The car is preserved in a museum in Skurup.
What is considered by many to be the first marketable popular steam car appeared in 1899 from the Locomobile Company of America, located in Watertown, Massachusetts, and from 1900 in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
Locomobile manufactured several thousand of its Runabout model in the period 1899–1903, designed around a motor design leased from the Stanley Steamer Company.
The company ceased producing steam cars in 1903 and changed to limited-production, internal combustion powered luxury automobiles.
In 1922, it was acquired by Durant Motors and discontinued with the failure of the parent company in 1929.
Perhaps the best selling and best known steam car was the Stanley Steamer, produced from 1896 to 1924.
Between 1899 and 1905, Stanley outsold all gasoline-powered cars and was second only to the electric cars of the Columbia Automobile Company in the U.S.
It used a compact fire-tube boiler to power a simple double acting two cylinder engine.
Because of the phenomenal torque available at all engine speeds, the steam car's engine was typically geared directly to the rear axle, with no clutch or variable speed transmission required.
Until 1914, Stanley steam cars vented their exhaust steam directly to the atmosphere, necessitating frequent refilling of the water tank; after 1914, all Stanleys were fitted with a condenser, which considerably reduced their water consumption.
In 1906, the Land Speed Record was broken by a Stanley steam car, piloted by Fred Marriott, which achieved 127 mph (204 km/h) at Ormond Beach, Florida.
This annual week-long "Speed Week" is still run, headed by the Daytona 500 stock car race This record was not exceeded by any car until 1910.
Attempts were made to bring more advanced steam cars on the market, the most remarkable being the Doble Steam Car which shortened start-up time very noticeably by incorporating a highly efficient monotube steam generator to heat a much smaller quantity of water along with effective automation of burner and water feed control.
By 1923, Doble's steam cars could be started from cold with the turn of a key and driven off in 40 seconds or less.
When the boiler had achieved maximum working pressure, the burner would cut out until pressure had fallen to a minimum level, whereupon it would reignite; by this means the car could achieve around 15 miles per gallon (18.8 liters/100 km) of kerosene despite its weight in excess of 5,000 lb (2,268 kg).
Ultimately, despite their undoubted qualities, Doble cars failed due to poor company organization and high initial cost.
In 1900, the American Bicycle Co. of Toledo, Ohio, created a 6.25 hp Toledo steam carriage (a description from the Horseless age, December 1900).
The American Bicycle Co was one of the enterprises within Col. Albert Pope's large conglomerate of bicycle and motor vehicles manufacturers.
The Toledo Steam carriage was a very well-made, high-quality machine where every component, bar the tires, bell, instruments and lights were made within the dedicated 245,000 sq ft factory in Toledo, Ohio.
The Toledo is considered to be one of the best steam cars produced at the time.
The engine was particularly robust and the 2, 3" diameter x 4" stroke pistons employed piston style valves instead of 'D' valves thus insuring better balance and reduced leakage of steam.
In September 1901 two Toledo steamers, one model B (a model A machine 1,000 to 2,000 pounds or 454 to 907 kilograms but with the foul-weather gear designating it as a model B) and one class E (public delivery vehicle), were entered by the American Bicycle Co. into the New York to Buffalo Endurance Contest of mid-September 1901.
There were 36 cars in class B and three in class E, the class B Toledo won the Grosse Point race.
On 4 January 1902, a specially built Toledo steam carriage was the first automobile to forge a trail from Flagstaff, Arizona to the South Rim of The Grand Canyon, a distance of 67 miles.
As a publicity exercise the trip was to assess the potential of starting a steam bus service but the anticipated afternoon journey took three days due to problems with supplies of the wrong fuel.
Though the Toledo towed a trailer filled with additional fuel and water supplies, the four participants omitted to take any food, one, the journalist Winfield Hoggaboon, wrote up an amusing article in the Los Angeles Herald two weeks later.
In December 1901, the company changed from the American Bicycle Company to the newly formed International Motor Car Company to concentrate on steam- and gasoline-driven models, with electric vehicles being made by the separate Waverly Electric Co.  Both steam and gasoline models were manufactured, but, as the public favored the gasoline models and steam carriage sales were slow, steam carriage production ceased in July 1902 and gasoline-driven models were then made under the name Pope-Toledo.
Total production of the steamers was between 285 and 325 units, as confirmed by a letter from the International Motor Car Co bookkeeper to the firms' accountant in June 1902.
The White Steamer was manufactured in Cleveland, Ohio, from 1900 until 1910 by the White Motor Company.
The Endurance Steam car was a steam car manufactured in the United States from 1922 until 1924.
The company had its origins in the Coats Steam Car and began production on the East Coast before shifting operations to Los Angeles in 1924.
There, one single touring car was made using a 1923 Elcar 6-60 body before the factory moved again, this time to Dayton, Ohio, where one more car was built, a sedan, before the company folded.
ORMOND, Fla., Jan. 26.
-- Faster than anything on wheels has traveled before, the Stanley steamer, with Fred Marriot at the wheel, covered a mile here to-day in 0:28 1-5.
This is at the rate of 127.66 miles an hour.
A half hour previous to this
the wonderful American speed creation did a kilometer in 0:18 2-5, traveling at the rate of 121 miles an hour.
Ernest Kanzler, the owner of Autocoast, approached Ross (Skip) Hedrich began work in the fall of 1968 with the idea of installing a steam engine in Hedrich's 1964 Indy car for an attempt at the 1906 steam car record.
Hedrich directed the program and Richard J. Smith consulted with Autocoast with his engine and steam generator system.
The car was intended for the 1969 Bonneville speed week, but was made too heavy and wide for the power plant.
Fortunately, an unexpected rain-storm made the salt flats too soggy, which made a credible excuse.
In 1985, Barber-Nichols Engineering of Denver used a steam turbine they had designed for Lear and the Los Angeles city bus program to attempt to gain the steam-powered land speed record.
The car was run at Speed Week on the Bonneville Salt Flats over a period of several years, eventually reaching a measured speed of 145.607 mph one pass.
A fire prevented the return run, and the speed was not recognized by the FIA.
FIA land speed records are based on an average of two runs (called 'passes') in opposite directions, taken within an hour of each other, unlike the original Stanley record.
On August 25, 2009, Team Inspiration of the British Steam Car Challenge broke the long-standing record for a steam vehicle set by a Stanley Steamer in 1906, by traveling at 139.843 mph (225.055 km/h) at the Edwards Air Force Base, in the Mojave Desert of California.
The car was driven by Charles Burnett III and reached a maximum speed of 136.103 mph (219.037 km/h) on the first run and 151.085 mph (243.148 km/h) on the second, which exceeded all previous single run attempts and records.
On August 26 the same car, driven this time by Don Wales, the grandson of Sir Malcolm Campbell,  achieved an average speed of 238.679 km/h (148.308 mph) over two consecutive runs over a kilometer.
(Wales deferred to Burnett for the mile record, although he surpassed it.)
This was also recorded and has since been ratified by the FIA.
On September 6, 2014, Chuk Williams of Steam Speed America attempted to break the current world record in their steam-powered streamliner.
The car reached 147 mph (236.57 km/h) on its first run but flipped and crashed when its braking chutes failed to open; Williams was injured in the accident, and the car was severely damaged.
Steering is the control of the direction of motion or the components that enable its control.
Steering is achieved through various arrangements, among them ailerons for airplanes, rudders for boats, tilting rotors for helicopters, and many more.
Aircraft flight control systems are normally steered when airborne by the use of ailerons, spoilerons, or both to bank the aircraft into a turn; although the rudder can also be used to turn the aircraft, it is usually used to minimize adverse yaw, rather than as a means to directly cause the turn.
On the ground, aircraft are generally steered at low speeds by turning the nosewheel or tailwheel (using a tiller or the rudder pedals) or through differential braking, and by the rudder at high speeds.
Missiles, airships and large hovercraft are usually steered by a rudder, thrust vectoring, or both.
Small sport hovercraft have similar rudders, but steer mostly by the pilot shifting their weight from side to side and unbalancing the more powerful lift forces beneath the skirt.
Jet packs and flying platforms are steered by thrust vectoring only.
Helicopter flight controls are steered by cyclic control, changing the thrust vector of the main rotor(s), and by anti-torque control, usually provided by a tail rotor.
A conventional automotive steering arrangement allows a driver to control the direction of the vehicle by turning the direction of the front wheels using a hand–operated steering wheel positioned in front of the driver.
The steering wheel is attached to a steering column, which is linked to rods, pivots and gears that allow the driver to change the direction of the front wheels.
Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles; for example, a tiller or rear-wheel steering.
Tracked vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks usually employ differential steering, where the tracks are made to move at different speeds or even in opposite directions, using the clutch and brakes, to achieve a change of direction.
The basic aim of steering is to ensure that the wheels are pointing in the desired direction to move the vehicle as required.
This is typically achieved by a series of linkages, rods, pivots, and gears.
One of the fundamental concepts is that of caster angle.
Each wheel is steered with a pivot point ahead of the wheel, which tends to make the steering self-centered in the direction of travel.
The steering linkages connecting the steering box and the wheels usually conform to a variation of Ackermann steering geometry, to account for the fact that in a turn, the inner wheel travels in a path of smaller radius than the outer wheel, so that the degree of toe suitable for driving in a straight path is not suitable for turns.
The angle the wheels make in the vertical plane, known as camber angle, also influences steering dynamics as do the tires.
Steering wheel turning is often measured in terms of number of full 360-degree turns to go lock-to-lock.
This is when the steering input mechanism is restrained at its mechanical limit from the full right-turn stop to the left-turn stop.
Many modern cars have a steering mechanism called a rack and pinion.
The steering wheel turns a pinion gear, which moves a rack back and forth to steer the wheels.
This mechanism converts the circular motion of the steering wheel to linear motion, which is applied to the wheels of the car via tie rods and a steering knuckle.
Rack and pinion steering has several advantages, such as a direct steering "feel".
This means that the driver can feel the road better and have more precise control over the car's movement.
BMW was one of the first manufacturers to adopt rack and pinion steering systems in the 1930s, with many other European manufacturers following suit.
American automakers began using rack and pinion steering in the 1974 Ford Pinto.
Older designs use two main principles: the worm and sector design and the screw and nut.
Both types were enhanced by reducing the friction; for screw and nut it is the recirculating ball mechanism, which is still found on trucks and utility vehicles.
The steering column turns a large screw, which meshes with the nut by recirculating balls.
The nut moves a sector of a gear, causing it to rotate about its axis as the screw is turned; an arm attached to the axis of the sector moves the pitman arm, which is connected to the steering linkage and thus steers the wheels.
The recirculating ball version of this apparatus reduces the considerable friction by placing large ball bearings between the screw and the nut.
At either end of the apparatus, the balls exit from between the two pieces into a channel internal to the box, which connects them with the other end of the apparatus.
Thus, they are "recirculated".
The recirculating ball mechanism has the advantage of a much greater mechanical advantage, so that it was found on larger, heavier vehicles while the rack and pinion was originally limited to smaller and lighter ones; due to the almost universal adoption of power steering, however, this is no longer an important advantage, leading to the increasing use of rack and pinion on newer cars.
The recirculating ball design also has a perceptible lash, or "dead spot" on center, where a minute turn of the steering wheel in either direction does not move the steering apparatus; this is easily adjustable via a screw on the end of the steering box to account for wear, but it cannot be eliminated because it will produce excessive internal forces at other positions and the mechanism will wear very rapidly.
This design is still in use in trucks and other large vehicles, where rapidity of steering and direct feel are less important than robustness, maintainability, and mechanical advantage.
The worm and sector was an older design, used for example in Willys and Chrysler vehicles, and the Ford Falcon (1960s).
To reduce friction, the sector is replaced by a roller or rotating pins on the rocker shaft arm.
Generally, older vehicles use the recirculating ball mechanism, and only newer vehicles use rack-and-pinion steering.
This division is not very strict, however, and rack-and-pinion steering systems can be found on British sports cars of the mid-1950s, and some German carmakers did not give up recirculating ball technology until the early 1990s.
Other systems for steering exist, but are uncommon on road vehicles.
Children's toys and go-karts often use a very direct linkage in the form of a bellcrank (also commonly known as a pitman arm) attached directly between the steering column and the steering arms, and the use of cable-operated steering linkages (e.g. the capstan and bowstring mechanism) is also found on some home-built vehicles such as soapbox cars and recumbent tricycles.
Power steering helps the driver of a vehicle to steer by directing some of its engine power to assist in swiveling the steered road wheels about their steering axes.
As vehicles have become heavier and switched to front-wheel drive, particularly using negative offset geometry, along with increases in tire width and diameter, the effort needed to turn the wheels about their steering axis has increased, often to the point where major physical exertion would be needed were it not for power assistance.
To alleviate this, auto makers have developed power steering systems, or more correctly power-assisted steering, since on road-going vehicles there has to be a mechanical linkage as a fail-safe.
There are two types of power steering systems: hydraulic and electric/electronic.
A hydraulic-electric hybrid system is also possible.
A Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS) uses hydraulic pressure supplied by an engine-driven pump to assist the motion of turning the steering wheel.
Electric Power Steering (EPS) is more efficient than hydraulic power-steering, since the electric power-steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly.
In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and driver preference.
An added benefit is the elimination of the environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic power-steering fluid.
In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.
Speed-sensitive steering allows for highly assisted steering at low speeds for maneuverability, and lightly assisted steering at high speed for stability.
The first vehicle with this feature was the Citroën SM with its DIRAVI system, first sold in France in 1970.
The hydraulic steering system applied force on a centering cam which pushed the steering rack and wheel back to the straight-ahead position.
The centering force increased with speed, requiring more effort to turn the wheel at greater speeds.
Four-wheel steering is a system employed by some vehicles to improve steering response, increase vehicle stability while maneuvering at high speed, or to decrease turning radius at low speed.
In an active four-wheel steering system, all four wheels turn at the same time when the driver steers.
In most active four-wheel steering systems, the rear wheels are steered by a computer and actuators.
The rear wheels generally cannot turn as far as the front wheels.
There can be controls to switch off the rear steering and options to steer only the rear wheels independently of the front wheels.
At low speed (e.g. parking)
the rear wheels turn opposite to the front wheels, reducing the turning radius, sometimes critical for large trucks, tractors, vehicles with trailers and passenger cars with a large wheelbase, while at higher speeds both front and rear wheels turn alike (electronically controlled), so that the vehicle may change position with less yaw and improved build-up of the lateral acceleration, enhancing straight-line stability.
The "snaking effect" experienced during motorway drives while towing a travel trailer is thus largely nullified.
Four-wheel steering found its most widespread use in monster trucks, where maneuverability in small arenas is critical, and it is also popular in large farm vehicles and trucks.
Some of the modern European Intercity buses also utilize four-wheel steering to assist maneuverability in bus terminals, and also to improve road stability.
Mazda were pioneers in applying four-wheel steering to automobiles, showing it on their 1984 Mazda MX-02 concept car, where the rear wheels counter-steered at low speeds.
Mazda proceeded to offer a version of this electronic four-wheel steering system on the Mazda 626 and MX6 in 1988.
The first rally vehicle to use the technology was the Peugeot 405 Turbo 16, which debuted at the 1988 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.
Previously, Honda had mechanical four-wheel steering as an option in their 1987–2001 Prelude and Honda Ascot models (1989–1996) later upgrading to electronically controlled.
General Motors offered Delphi's Quadrasteer in their Silverado/Sierra and Suburban/Yukon.
Due to low demand, GM discontinued the technology at the end of the 2005 model year.
Nissan/Infiniti offer several versions of their HICAS system as standard or as an option in much of their line-up.
In the early 2000s, a new generation of four-wheel steering systems was introduced into the market.
In 2001 BMW equipped the E65 7 series with an all-wheel steering system (optional, called 'Integral Active Steering'), which is available on the current 5, 6, and 7 series, as an option.
Renault introduced an optional all-wheel steering called '4control' in 2009, at first on the Laguna GT, which is currently available on the Talisman, Mégane and Espace vehicle lines.
In 2013, Porsche introduced a system on the 911 Turbo as standard equipment.
Since 2016, the Panamera has been offered with optional all-wheel steering.
The 2014 Audi Q7 was launched with an optional system.
Also the Japanese OEMs offer luxury segment vehicles equipped with all-wheel steering, such as Infiniti on its QX70 model ('Rear Active Steering') and Lexus on the GS.
Italian manufacturers have launched the technology in the model years 2016–17 with the Ferrari F12tdf, the Ferrari GTC4Lusso as well as the Lamborghini Aventador S Coupé.
Crab steering is a special type of active four-wheel steering.
It operates by steering all wheels in the same direction and at the same angle.
Crab steering is used when the vehicle needs to proceed in a straight line but at an angle: when changing lanes on a highway at speed, when moving loads with a reach truck, or during filming with a camera dolly.
Rear wheel steering can also be used when the rear wheels may not follow the path taken by the front wheel tracks (e.g. to reduce soil compaction when using rolling farm equipment).
Many modern vehicles have passive rear-wheel steering.
On many vehicles, when cornering, the rear wheels tend to steer slightly to the outside of a turn, which can reduce stability.
The passive steering system uses the lateral forces generated in a turn (through suspension geometry) and the bushings to correct this tendency and steer the wheels slightly to the inside of the corner.
This improves the stability of the car through the turn.
This effect is called compliance understeer; it, or its opposite, is present on all suspensions.
Typical methods of achieving compliance understeer are to use a Watt's link on a live rear axle, or the use of toe control bushings on a twist beam suspension.
On an independent rear suspension it is normally achieved by changing the rates of the rubber bushings in the suspension.
Some suspensions typically have compliance oversteer due to geometry, such as Hotchkiss live axles, semi-trailing arm IRS, and rear twist beams, but may be mitigated by revisions to the pivot points of the leaf spring or trailing arm, or additional suspension links, or complex internal geometry of the bushings.
Passive rear-wheel steering is not a new concept, as it has been in use for many years, although not always recognized as such.
Articulated steering is a system by which a vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge.
The front and rear halves are connected with one or more hydraulic cylinders that change the angle between the halves, including the front and rear axles and wheels, thus steering the vehicle.
This system does not use steering arms, king pins, tie rods, etc. as does four-wheel steering.
If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles, it also eliminates the need for a central differential in four-wheel drive vehicles, as both front and rear axles will follow the same path, and thus rotate at the same speed.
Articulated haulers have very good off-road performance.
Vehicle-trailer-combinations such as semi-trailers, road trains, articulated buses, and internal transport trolley trains can be regarded as passively-articulated vehicles.
A few types of vehicle use only rear-wheel steering, notably fork lift trucks, camera dollies, early pay loaders, Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion car, and the ThrustSSC.
In cars, rear-wheel steering tends to be unstable because, in turns, the steering geometry changes, hence decreasing the turn radius (oversteer), rather than increasing it (understeer).
Rear-wheel steering is meant for slower vehicles that need high-maneuverability in tight spaces, e.g. fork lifts.
For heavy haulage or for increased maneuverability, some semi-trailers are fitted with rear-wheel steering, controlled electro-hydraulically.
The wheels on all or some of the rear axles may be turned through different angles to enable tighter cornering, or through the same angle (crab steering) to move the rear of the trailer laterally.
The absence of steering column simplifies the car interior design.
The absence of steering shaft, column and gear reduction mechanism allows much better space utilization in the engine compartment.
The steering mechanism can be designed and installed as a modular unit.
Without mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the road wheel, it is less likely that the impact of a frontal crash will cause the steering wheel to impact the driver.
Steering system characteristics can easily be adjusted to change the steering response and feel.
Steer-by-wire without the use of a steering column was first offered in a production car with the Nissan Infiniti Q50 in 2013.
Steer-by-wire continued to be offered with the QX50 and QX55, and as of 2022 is being offered with the Infiniti Q60 coupe.
Production battery electric vehicles in the 2020s that offer steer-by-wire with no steering column include the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle, Lexus RZ 450e, REE Automotive P7-module-based vehicles, Toyota bZ4X, and Tesla Cybertruck.
As of 2023 Lotus, Peugeot, and Mercedes-Benz plan to offer steer-by-wire cars in the mid to late 2020s.
Traditionally, cars feature a collapsible steering column (energy absorbing steering column) which will collapse in the event of a heavy frontal impact to avoid excessive injuries to the driver.
Airbags are also generally fitted as standard.
Non-collapsible steering columns fitted to older vehicles very often impaled drivers in frontal crashes, particularly when the steering box or rack was mounted in front of the front axle line, at the front of the crumple zone.
This was particularly a problem on vehicles that had a rigid separate chassis frame with no crumple zone.
Many modern vehicle steering boxes or racks are mounted behind the front axle on the front bulkhead, at the rear of the front crumple zone.
Collapsible steering columns were invented by Béla Barényi and were introduced in the 1959 Mercedes-Benz W111 Fintail, along with crumple zones.
This safety feature first appeared on cars built by General Motors after an extensive and very public lobbying campaign enacted by Ralph Nader.
Ford started to install collapsible steering columns in 1968.
Audi used a retractable steering wheel and seat belt tensioning system called procon-ten, but it has since been discontinued in favor of airbags and pyrotechnic seat belt pre-tensioners.
See the section § Bicycles.
Differential steering is the primary means of steering tracked vehicles, such as tanks and bulldozers; it is also used in certain wheeled vehicles commonly known as skid-steers, and implemented in some automobiles, where it is called torque vectoring, to augment steering by changing wheel direction relative to the vehicle.
In the European Union, Russia and Japan, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) vehicle regulation 79 is related to steering.
In the United States, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 203 and 204 are related to impact protection for the driver from the steering control system and steering control rearward displacement while 49 Code of Federal Regulations § 393.209 is related to steering wheel systems.
In North America, "hands-off" or "hands-free" level-2 systems allowing the drivers to remove both hands from the steering wheel were introduced and legally permitted.
General Motors' Super Cruise is such an implementation.
In those designs warnings are raised when driver disengages his/her visual attention.
In May 2023, in Europe, UNECE regulation 79 still requires assistant systems for steering to prompt drivers not to remove their hands from the steering wheel.
Those systems are known as "hands-on" systems.
With "hands-on" assisted driving systems, British and European drivers are required by the system itself to keep one or both hands on the steering wheel, as with unassisted driving: When driving with assisted steering, if drivers remove both hands from the steering wheel, an optical warning occurs after the first 15 seconds and an acoustic warning occurs after 15 more seconds.
Assisted steering is deactivated after additional 30 seconds.
Turning the handlebar rotates the front wheel with respect to the plane of the circumference of the rear wheel.
Friction of the front wheel with the ground provides the lateral forces that steer the bicycle.
Modern bicycles have the front-wheel ground-contact-point trailing behind the steering axis, which is the long axis of the bicycle fork through the center of the front wheel.
This trailing contact point adds to the effects of inertia and centre-of-mass offset which affect the steering and self-stability of the bicycle.
Leaning the frame of the bicycle, which displaces the rider and parts of the bicycle in relation to the axis along the ground contact points of the wheels.
Gravitational forces then provide the lateral forces that steer the bicycle.
Ships and boats are usually steered with a rudder.
Depending on the size of the vessel, rudders can be manually actuated, or operated using a servomechanism, or a trim tab or servo tab system.
Rowing may be used to steer rowboats by using specific paddle strokes.
Boats using outboard motors steer by rotating the entire drive unit.
Boats with inboard motors sometimes steer by rotating the propeller pod only (i.e., Volvo Penta IPS drive).
Steering wheels may be used to control the rudder or propeller.
Modern ships with diesel-electric drive use azimuth thrusters.
Boats powered by oars or paddles are steered by generating a higher propulsion force on the side of the boat opposite of the direction of turn.
Jet skis are steered by weight-shift induced roll and water jet thrust vectoring.
The rudder of a vessel can steer the ship only when water is passing over it.
Hence, when a ship is not moving relative to the water it is in or cannot move its rudder, it does not respond to the helm and is said to have lost steerage.
The motion of a ship through the water is known as making way.
Boats on rivers must always be under propulsion, even when traveling downstream, in order to steer, requiring sufficient water to pass over the surface of the rudder to effect changes in the direction of the boat in response to the helm.
This is called having "steerage way".
Springfield is the most populous city in and the seat of Hampden County, Massachusetts, United States.
Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River near its confluence with three rivers: the western Westfield River, the eastern Chicopee River, and the eastern Mill River.
At the 2020 census, the city's population was 155,929, making it the third most populous city in the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the fourth most populous city in New England after Boston, Worcester, and Providence.
Metropolitan Springfield, as one of two metropolitan areas in Massachusetts (the other being Greater Boston), had a population of 699,162 in 2020.
Springfield was founded in 1636, the first Springfield in the New World.
In the late 1700s, during the American Revolution, Springfield was designated by George Washington as the site of the Springfield Armory because of its central location.
Subsequently it was the site of Shays' Rebellion.
The city would also play a pivotal role in the Civil War, as a stop on the Underground Railroad and home of abolitionist John Brown, widely known for his raid on Harpers Ferry, and for the Armory's manufacture of the famed "Springfield rifles" used ubiquitously by Union troops.
Closing during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, today the national park site features the largest collection of historic American firearms in the world.
Today the city is the largest in western New England, and the urban, economic, and media capital of Massachusetts' section of the Connecticut River Valley, colloquially known as the Pioneer Valley.
Springfield has several nicknames—"The City of Firsts", due to the many innovations developed there, such as the first American dictionary, the first American gas-powered automobile, and the first machining lathe for interchangeable parts; "The City of Homes", due to its Victorian residential architecture; and "Hoop City", as basketball was invented in Springfield in 1891 by Canadian James Naismith.
Hartford, the capital of Connecticut, lies 24 miles (39 km) south of Springfield, on the western bank of the Connecticut River.
The Hartford–Springfield region is known as the Knowledge Corridor because it hosts over 160,000 university students and over 32 universities and liberal arts colleges—the second-highest concentration of higher-learning institutions in the United States.
The city of Springfield itself is home to Springfield College, Western New England University, American International College, and Springfield Technical Community College, among other higher educational institutions.
At the time of European contact at settlement, the Springfield area was inhabited by the Agawam tribe, who sold land to English settlers..
Springfield was founded in 1636 by English Puritan William Pynchon as "Agawam Plantation" under the administration of the Connecticut Colony.
In 1641 it was renamed after Pynchon's hometown of Springfield, Essex, England, following incidents, including trade disputes as well as Captain John Mason's hostilities toward native tribes, which precipitated the settlement's joining the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
During its early existence, Springfield flourished both as an agricultural settlement and as a trading post, although its prosperity waned dramatically during (and after) King Philip's War in 1675, when natives laid siege to it and burned it to the ground.
During that attack, three-quarters of the original settlement was burned to the ground, with many of Springfield's residents survived by taking refuge in John Pynchon's brick house, the "Old Fort", the first such house to be built in the Connecticut River Valley.
Out of the siege, Miles Morgan and his sons were lauded as heroes; as one of the few homesteads to survive the attack, alerting troops in Hadley, as well as Toto, often referred to as the "Windsor Indian" who, running 20 miles from Windsor, Connecticut, to the settlement, was able to give advance warning of the attack.
The original settlement—today's downtown Springfield—was located atop bluffs at the confluence of four rivers, at the nexus of trade routes to Boston, Albany, New York City, and Montreal, and with some of the northeastern United States' most fertile soil.
In 1777, Springfield's location at numerous crossroads led George Washington and Henry Knox to establish the United States' National Armory at Springfield, which produced the first American musket in 1794, and later the famous Springfield rifle.
From 1777 until its closing during the Vietnam War, the Springfield Armory attracted skilled laborers to Springfield, making it the United States' longtime center for precision manufacturing.
The near-capture of the armory during Shays' Rebellion of 1787 led directly to the formation of the U.S. Constitutional Convention.
During the 19th and 20th centuries, Springfielders produced many innovations, including the first American-English dictionary (1805, Merriam-Webster); the first use of interchangeable parts and the assembly line in manufacturing (1819, Thomas Blanchard); the first American horseless car (1825, Thomas Blanchard); the mass production of vulcanized rubber (1844, Charles Goodyear); the first American gasoline-powered car (1893, Duryea Brothers); the first successful motorcycle company (1901, "Indian"); one of America's first commercial radio stations (1921, WBZ, broadcast from the Hotel Kimball); and most famously, the world's second-most-popular sport, basketball (1891, Dr. James Naismith).
Springfield would play major roles in machine production, initially driven by the arms industry of the Armory, as well as from private companies such as Smith & Wesson, established by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson.
Similarly, the industrial economy led Thomas and Charles Wason to establish the Wason Manufacturing Company, which produced the first manufactured sleeping car.
The largest railcar works in New England, Wason produced 100 cars a day at its peak; the company was eventually purchased by Brill in 1907 and closed during the Depression in 1937.
Among numerous other industries, during the first half of the 20th century Springfield also produced brass goods, chemicals, clothing and knit goods, paper goods, watches, boilers, engines, manufacturing machinery, silverware, jewelry, skates, carriages, buttons, needles, toys, and printed books and magazines.
Springfield underwent a protracted decline during the second half of the 20th century, due largely to the decommissioning of the Springfield Armory in 1969; poor city planning decisions, such as the location of the elevated I-91 along the city's Connecticut River front; and overall decline of industry throughout the northeastern United States.
During the 1980s and 1990s, Springfield developed a national reputation for crime, political corruption, and cronyism.
During the early 21st century, Springfield saw long-term revitalization projects and several large projects, including the $1 billion New Haven–Hartford–Springfield intercity rail; a $1 billion MGM casino., and the $95 million redevelopment of Springfield Union Station.
In December 2022, Springfield was designated by the National Park Service as an American World War II Heritage City, the first in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and one of only 18 communities in the country.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 33.1 square miles (85.7 km2), of which 31.9 square miles (82.5 km2) are land and 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2), or 3.65%, are water.
Once nicknamed "The City in a Forest", Springfield features over 4.0 square miles (10.4 km2) of urban parkland, 12% of its total land area.
Located in the fertile Connecticut River Valley, surrounded by mountains, bluffs, and rolling hills in all cardinal directions, Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River, near its confluence with two major tributary rivers—the western Westfield River, which flows into the Connecticut opposite Springfield's South End Bridge; and the eastern Chicopee River, which flows into the Connecticut less than 0.5 mi (0.8 km) north of Springfield, in the city of Chicopee (which constituted one of Springfield's most populous neighborhoods until it separated and became an independent municipality in 1852).
The Connecticut state line is only 4 miles (6 km) south of Springfield, beside the wealthy suburb of Longmeadow, which itself separated from Springfield in 1783.
Springfield's densely urban Metro Center district surrounding Main Street is relatively flat, and follows the north–south trajectory of the Connecticut River; however, as one moves eastward, the city becomes increasingly hilly.
Aside from its rivers, Springfield's second most prominent topographical feature is the city's 735-acre (297 ha) Forest Park.
Forest Park lies in the southwestern corner of the city, surrounded by Springfield's attractive garden districts, Forest Park and Forest Park Heights, which feature over 600 Victorian Painted Lady mansions.
Forest Park also borders Longmeadow.
Springfield shares borders with other suburbs such as East Longmeadow, Wilbraham, Ludlow and the city of Chicopee.
The small cities of Agawam and West Springfield lie less than a mile (1.6 km) from Springfield's Metro Center, across the Connecticut River.
The City of Springfield also owns the Springfield Country Club, located in the autonomous city of West Springfield, which separated from Springfield in 1774.
Springfield, like other cities in southern New England, has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfa) with four distinct seasons and precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year, but the intensity (and sometimes the duration) of warmer periods is greater than in northern areas.
Winters are cold with a daily average in January of around 26 °F (−3 °C).
During winter, nor'easter storms can drop significant snowfalls on Springfield and the Connecticut River Valley.
Temperatures below 0
°F (−18 °C) can occur each year, though the area does not experience the high snowfall amounts and blustery wind averages of nearby cities such as Worcester, Massachusetts, and Albany, New York.
Springfield's summers are very warm and sometimes humid.
During summer, several times per month, on hot days afternoon thunderstorms will develop when unstable warm air collides with approaching cold fronts.
The daily average in July is around 74 °F (23 °C).
Usually several days during the summer exceed 90 °F (32 °C), constituting a "heat wave".
Spring and fall temperatures are usually pleasant, with mild days and crisp, cool nights.
Precipitation averages 45.85 inches (1,165 mm) annually, and snowfall averages 40.5 inches (103 cm), most of which falls from mid-December to early March.
Although not unheard of, extreme weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes occur infrequently in Springfield compared with other areas in the country.
On the occasions that hurricanes have hit New England, Springfield's inland, upriver location has caused its damages to be considerably less than shoreline cities like New Haven, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island.
On June 1, 2011, Springfield was directly struck by the second-largest tornado ever to hit Massachusetts.
With wind speeds exceeding 160 mph (257 km/h), the tornado left three dead, hundreds injured, and over 500 homeless in the city alone.
The tornado caused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage to Springfield and wrought significant destruction in a 39-mile-long (63 km) path from Westfield to Charlton, Massachusetts.
It was the first deadly tornado to strike Massachusetts since May 29, 1995.

Springfield's 2010 crime rating of 142 is down approximately 50% from its heights in the late 1990s and 2000s.
The Urban Land Institute stated in 2010 that "the perception of crime
[in Springfield] appears to be worse than the reality".
By another measure, crime and population data collected by the FBI, and indexed by NeighborhoodScout showed between 2010 and 2018 the violent crime rate for Springfield decreased by approximately 52.5%, whereas the property crime rate declined by 54%; both rates remain more than twice their respective state averages, as of 2018.
Springfield's vicinity to both Boston and New York City lends it a location well suited for distribution, and in the past this has played a significant role in its economy.
For this reason in the early 20th century it was the largest producer in New England of commercially produced cakes and pastries, and among the largest in bread—with one 1926 estimate of 1.4 million loaves of bread and 14 million breakfast rolls produced in the city on a weekly basis.
Today Springfield's top five industries (in order, by number of workers) are: Education and Health Services; Trade and Transportation; Manufacturing; Tourism and Hospitality; and Professional & Business Services.
Springfield is considered to have a "mature economy", which protects the city to a degree during recessions and inhibits it somewhat during bubbles.
Springfield is considered to have one of America's top emerging multi-cultural markets—the city features a 33% Latino population with buying power that has increased over 295% from 1990 to 2006.
As of 2006, more than 60% of Hispanic Springfielders had arrived in the city since 1986.
With 25 universities and colleges within a 15-mile (24 km) radius from Springfield, including several universities and liberal arts colleges, and more than six institutions within the city itself, the Hartford–Springfield metropolitan area has been dubbed the Knowledge Corridor by regional educators, civic authorities, and businessmen—touting its 32 universities and liberal arts colleges, numerous highly regarded hospitals, and nearly 120,000 students.
The Knowledge Corridor universities and colleges provide the region with an educated workforce, which yields a yearly GDP of over $100 billion—more than at least 16 U.S. States.

The Quadrangle's five museums are the Museum of Fine Arts, which features a large Impressionist collection; the George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum, a collection of Asian curiosities; the Springfield Science Museum, which features a life-size Tyrannosaurus Rex, an aquarium and  the first American-made planetarium, designed and built (1937) by Frank Korkosz; the Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum, as Springfield is the birthplace of Theodor Geisel; and the Lyman and Merrie Wood Museum of Springfield History, a museum about the multi-faceted city.
The Connecticut Valley Historical Museum was one of the Quadrangle's five museums until 2009.
In 2017 the Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum opened in the former location, the William Pynchon Memorial Building.
The collections of the Connecticut Valley Historical Museum are now located in the Lyman and Merrie Wood Museum of Springfield History.
Springfield's Indian Orchard neighborhood is home to the RMS Titanic Historical Society's Titanic Museum, which displays a collection of rare artifacts that tell stories about the ill-fated ocean liner's passengers and crew.

In 2011, Springfield's music scene was eclectic.
It featured a notable heavy rock scene, from which the bands Gaiah, Staind, All That Remains, Shadows Fall, and The Acacia Strain rose to national prominence.
Jazz and blues rival rock in popularity.
In 2010 and 2011 the Springfield-headquartered Hampden Bank sponsored the Hoops City Jazz & Art Festival, a three-day event that drew approximately 30,000 people to Metro Center to hear varieties of different jazz music—from smooth jazz, to hard bop, to New Orleans-style jazz.
Headliners included Springfield great Taj Mahal, the Average White Band, and Poncho Sanchez.
Basketball Hall of Fame: housed in a $47 million structure designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, it is a shrine to the world's second most popular sport, basketball.
Located in the city where basketball was invented, the facility—built beside the Connecticut River—spans 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) features numerous restaurants and the WMAS-FM studios.
However, it is separated from Springfield's Metro Center by an eight-lane highway, Interstate 91.

Connecticut River Walk Park: a landscaped park that snakes along the Connecticut River, offering views of the Mount Tom Range, Mount Holyoke Range, and Springfield's skyline.
However, this park is separated from the city by the eight lane Interstate 91, which cuts through three riverfront neighborhoods and poses accessibility challenges.
In 2010, the Urban Land Institute released a plan for Springfield's riverfront, presenting the possibility of moving Interstate 91 or otherwise altering it to allow easier access to the River Walk and the Basketball Hall of Fame.
Court Square: a park, referred to as "Springfield's front door", it remains the city's only topographical constant since its founding in 1636.
Located on Main Street and surrounded by ornate architecture, including the iconic Springfield Municipal Group, Court Square is the civic heart of Springfield.
Until the 1960s, Court Square extended to the Connecticut River; however, as with Forest Park, its connection to the river was severed by the building of the Interstate 91 elevated highway.
Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden: amidst the Quadrangle, there are large, bronze statues of characters from Springfield native Dr. Seuss's books.
First Game of Basketball Sculpture: located directly on the site of the first game of basketball, this illuminated sculpture in Springfield's Mason Square commercial district has become a site of pilgrimage for basketball fans from around the world.
Forest Park: nearly the same size as Central Park at 735 acres (297.4 ha), it features the Zoo at Forest Park; the 31 acres (12.5 ha) Porter Lake; numerous playgrounds; a formal rose garden; 38 tennis courts; a skating arena; numerous basketball and bocce courts; lawn bowling fields; Victorian promenades and water gardens; tree groves; baseball diamonds; numerous statues; an aquatic park; and the Barney Carriage House, where many weddings take place.

Located across from historic Court Square in Metro Center, the arena houses the American Hockey League's Springfield Thunderbirds.
The venue also attracts big-name concert tours.
In the past, it has hosted concerts by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Van Halen, Marilyn Manson, The Eagles, and Bob Dylan, among many others.

Originally located in Stearns Square, it has been located in Merrick Park in the Quadrangle for over 100 years and become a symbol of Springfield.
The Quadrangle: a campus of five museums surrounding the Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden.
It includes the Museum of Fine Arts, known for its Impressionist and Dutch Renaissance collections, as well as its collection of American masters, including works by Springfielder James McNeill Whistler.
The Springfield Science Museum features the United States' first planetarium (built 1931), and a large dinosaur exhibit.
The George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum is known worldwide for housing the largest collection of Chinese cloisonné outside of China; it also features exotic curiosities like Asian suits of armor, and a collection of marble busts.
The Quadrangle also features two regional history museums: the Connecticut Valley Historical Society, which tells the story of "The Great River" and its people, and the new Museum of Springfield History, which showcases the innovations that make Springfield "The City of Progress" during the abolitionist period and Industrial Revolution, which includes the first American–English dictionary, the first gasoline-powered car, the first successful motorcycle company, the first modern fire engine, and dozens of other firsts (see below for a more complete list).
St. John's Congregational Church: founded in 1844 as the Sanford Street "Free Church", St. John's Congregational Church is a predominately black church that played a pivotal role in the abolitionist movement.
While living in Springfield, John Brown attended services here from 1846 to 1850, and as of 2011, the church still displays John Brown's Bible.
It was at this church where John Brown met Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and other prominent abolitionists—and where he later founded the militant League of Gileadites in response to the Fugitive Slave Act.
As of 2011, St. John's remains one of the most prominent, predominately black congregations in the Northeastern United States.
St. Michael's Cathedral: beside the Quadrangle, this elegant Catholic Church is the seat of the Diocese of Greater Springfield.
Stacy Building: the location where, in 1892–1893, the Duryea Brothers built the first, American gasoline-powered car, which in 1895 won the first automobile race in Chicago, Illinois.
A model of the Duryea Brothers' first car sits in a tree-shaded park beside the historic location, amidst the restaurants and bars of the Club Quarter.

The Springfield Armory National Historic Site: founded by General George Washington and Henry Knox in 1777; the site of Shays' Rebellion in 1787, which led directly to the U.S. Constitutional Convention; the site of numerous technological innovations including the manufacturing advances known as interchangeable parts, the assembly line, and mass production; and the producer of the United States Military's firearms from 1794 to 1968, when the Armory was controversially shut down by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.
Today, it is a National Historic Site, and features a museum that includes one of the world's largest collections of firearms.
Springfield Cemetery: opened in 1841 and located in the heart of the city, it is designed in the scenic rural cemetery tradition.
The cemetery is the final resting place of many pioneer settlers and noted individuals from Springfield and the region.
Symphony Hall: dedicated in 1913 by President William Howard Taft as part of the Springfield Municipal Group, Springfield Symphony Hall features "perfect acoustics".
It is home to the Springfield Symphony Orchestra conducted by showman Kevin Rhodes, and also hosts Broadway touring productions.
Stearns Square: designed by the artistic team of Stanford White and Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1897, this small park is the center of Springfield's Club Quarter.
It features ornate architectural and sculptural details from the original team's design; however, most of those were meant to accompany The Puritan, and thus moved to storage.
Stearns Square hosts a large motorcycle gathering each Thursday evening, and is the site of a summer concert series.
In addition to its nickname The City of Firsts, Springfield is known as The City of Homes for its attractive architecture, which differentiates it from most medium-size, Northeastern American cities.
Most of Springfield's housing stock consists of Victorian "Painted Ladies" (similar to those found in San Francisco); however, Springfield also features Gilded Age mansions, urban condominiums buildings, brick apartment blocks, and more suburban post-World War II architecture (in the Sixteen Acres and Pine Point neighborhoods).
While Springfield's architecture is attractive, much of its built-environment stems from the 19th and early 20th centuries when the city experienced a period of "intense and concentrated prosperity"—today, its Victorian architecture can be found in various states of rehabilitation and disrepair.
As of 2011, Springfield's housing prices are considerably lower than nearby New England cities which do not feature such intricate architecture.
In Metro Center, stands the two prominent skyscrapers, Tower Square, and Monarch Place, the latter of which is the tallest building in Massachusetts outside of Boston.
Many of the city's Victorian buildings including former hotels, factories, and other institutions have been converted into apartment buildings and luxury condominiums.
For example, Springfield's ornate Classical High School (235 State Street), with its immense Victorian atrium—where Dr. Seuss, Timothy Leary, and Taj Mahal all went to high school—is now a luxury condominium building.
The Hotel Kimball, (140 Chestnut Street), which hosted several U.S. Presidents as guests and once featured the United States' first commercial radio station (WBZ), has been converted into The Kimball Towers Condominiums.
The former McIntosh Shoe Company (158 Chestnut Street), one of Springfield's finest examples of the Chicago School of Architecture, has been converted into industrial-style condominiums; and the red-brick, former Milton Bradley toy factory is now Stockbridge Court Apartments (45 Willow Street).
In the Ridgewood Historic District, the 1950s-futurist Mulberry House (101 Mulberry Street), is now a condominium building that features some of the finest views of Springfield.
Forest Park (and Forest Park Heights), surrounding by the 735 acres (297.4 ha) Forest Park, is a New England Garden District featuring more than 600 Victorian Painted Ladies.
The McKnight National Historic District, America's first planned residential neighborhood, (1881), features more than 900 Victorian Painted Ladies, many of which have been rehabilitated by Springfield's growing LGBT community.
The Old Hill, Upper Hill, and Bay neighborhoods also feature this type of architecture.
Maple High, which is architecturally (and geographically) distinct from, but often included with Springfield's economically depressed Six Corners neighborhood, was Springfield's first "Gold Coast".
Many mansions from the early 19th century and later gilded age stand atop a bluff on Maple Street, overlooking the Connecticut River.
The Ridgewood Historic district on Ridgewood and Mulberry Streets also feature historic mansions from the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Springfield—like many mid-size Northeastern cities, e.g., Hartford, Albany, and New Haven—from the 1950s to the 1970s, razed a significant number of historic commercial buildings in the name of urban renewal.
In 1961, this included Unity Church, the first building designed by the young Henry Hobson Richardson.
Springfield's Metro Center remains more aesthetically cohesive than many its peer cities; however, as elsewhere, the city currently features a patchwork of parking lots and grand old buildings.
Current efforts are underway to improve the cohesion of Springfield's Metro Center, including the completed Main Street and State Street Corridor improvement projects, the upcoming $70 million renovation to Springfield's 1926 Union Station and the renovation of the Epiphany Tower on State Street into a new hotel.
New constructions include the architecturally award-winning, $57 million Moshe Safdie-designed Federal Building on State Street.
Efforts to establish a public library began in the 1850s.
In fiscal year 2008, the city of Springfield spent 1.13% ($5,321,151) of its budget on its public library—approximately $35 per person, per year ($46.12 adjusted for inflation to 2022).
In fiscal year 2009, Springfield spent about 1% ($5,077,158) of its budget on the library—approximately $32 per person, per year ($42.32 adjusted for inflation to 2022).
Springfield has Massachusetts' 2nd largest library circulation, behind Boston.
Besides Springfield's historic connection with basketball, the city has a rich sporting history.
Volleyball was invented in the adjacent city of Holyoke, and the first exhibition match was held in 1896 at the International YMCA Training School, now known as Springfield College.
Ice hockey has been played professionally in Springfield since the 1920s, and Springfield is home to the league headquarters of the American Hockey League.
The Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League (now located in Utica, New York) was the oldest minor league hockey franchise in existence.
In 1994 the team relocated to Worcester and was replaced by the Springfield Falcons, who played at the MassMutual Center.
The Falcons were then replaced by the Springfield Thunderbirds in 2016.
For parts of two seasons (1978–1980) the NHL Hartford Whalers played in Springfield while their arena was undergoing repairs after a roof collapse.
On the amateur level, the Junior A Springfield Olympics played for many years at the Olympia, while American International College's Yellow Jackets compete in NCAA Division I hockey.

The Zombies in 2021 were named ECBL Mid-Atlantic Champions.
Prior to the 2014–2015 season, Springfield was home to the Springfield Armor of the NBA Development League, which began play in 2009 at the MassMutual Center.
Beginning in the 2011–2012 season, the Armor was the exclusive affiliate of the Brooklyn Nets.

The New England Blizzard of the ABL played its first game in Springfield, and several minor pro men's and women's teams have called the city home, including the Springfield Fame of the United States Basketball League (the league's inaugural champion in 1985) and the Springfield Hall of Famers of the Eastern Professional Basketball League.
Springfield has had professional baseball in the past.
The Springfield Giants of the Single- and Double-A Eastern League played between 1957 and 1965.
The team was quite successful, winning consecutive championships in 1959, 1960 and 1961, by startling coincidence the same seasons in which the Springfield Indians won three straight Calder Cup championships in hockey.
The Giants played at Pynchon Park by the Connecticut River until relocating after the 1965 season.
Pynchon Park's grandstands were destroyed by fire the year after in 1966.
Before that time, the Springfield Cubs played in the minor league New England League from 1946 until 1949, after which the league folded; they then played in the International League until 1953.
For many years before the Giants, Springfield was also a member of the Eastern League, between 1893 and 1943.
In general, the team was named the Ponies, but it also carried the nicknames of "Maroons" (1895), "Green Sox" (1917), "Hampdens" (1920–1921), "Rifles (1932, 1942–1943) and "Nationals" (1939–1941).

Apremont Triangle Park is a triangular, pocket park in front of Springfield's historic Kimball Towers in Metro Center.
Named for Springfield's 104th Infantry Regiment, which following the World War I Battle of Apremont, became the first U.S. military unit awarded for heroism by a foreign power, receiving France's highest military honor: the Croix de Guerre for bravery in combat.
The same Springfield unit received the same honor again in World War II.

Renovated in 2009, Armoury Commons features several sculptures, including Pynchon Park's original sculpture.
The park is often used as a place to play chess and other games.
Connecticut River Walk Park is a narrow, landscaped park that snakes along the scenic Connecticut River for several miles.
Beginning near the Basketball Hall of Fame, it features jogging trails, benches, boat docks, and plazas—all of which afford scenic vistas of the Connecticut River and Connecticut River Valley.
However, Interstate 91's position, height, and ancillary structures—including a 1,756-car, below-grade parking lot (the largest in the city), and 20-foot (6 m) stone walls block all views of the Connecticut River, and all but three passages to the park from Metro Center.
Despite Springfield's rating as one of the most walkable cities in the U.S., due to the poor planning of I-91, this park can be difficult to reach on foot.
Court Square has been Springfield's one topographical constant since colonial days—it is located in Metro Center.
Featuring monuments to Springfield's hero during King Philip's War of 1675, Miles Morgan; President William McKinley; and a Civil War memorial Court Square is surrounded by extraordinarily fine architecture, including H.H. Richardson's Richardsonian Romanesque Courthouse; the Springfield Municipal Group featuring the Greek Revival City Hall, Symphony Hall, and the 300-foot (91 m) Italianate Campanile; and also the 1819 reconstruction of the 1638 Old First Church.

Contrary to popular belief, the park was not designed by Fredrick Law Olmsted.
King Philip's Stockade is an historic park, famous as the site where Native Americans organized the 1675 Sack of Springfield; The Stockade features numerous picnic pavilions, excellent views of the Connecticut River Valley, and a sculpture of The Windsor Indian, who tried in vain to warn the residents of Springfield of coming danger.

It features ornamental perimeter fencing surrounding a playground.
Leonardo da Vinci Park was renovated in 2009 and now features new picnic tables and playground equipment.
Pynchon Park is an architecturally interesting brutalist-style city park, which was dedicated in 1977.
It links Springfield's Metro Center with the Quadrangle cultural grouping, (the museums and sculptures sit atop a steep bluff).
Mostly made of poured concrete, but featuring a waterfall, lush greenery, and fountains, Pynchon Park received numerous accolades from the American Institute of Architecture for "enhancing the quality of the urban environment in the core of the city".
It features two levels and a distinctive elevator.
Stearns Square is a rectangular park between Worthington Street and Bridge Street in Springfield's Club Quarter, located in Metro Center.
Designed by the creative 'dream-team' of Stanford White and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.
It was there that St. Gaudens' most famous work, The Puritan, originally stood.
The Puritan has since been moved to the Quadrangle, at the corner of State and Chestnut Streets; however, White's and St. Gaudens' original fountain, bench, and turtle sculptures, all meant to complement The Puritan, remain in Stearns Square.
Van Horn Park is a large park in the Hungry Hill section of Liberty Heights in Springfield.
It features two ponds and a reservoir.
The Reservoir and lower dam are not generally accessible to the public.
The Main Entrance is on Armory Street near Chapin Terrace.
Springfield employs a strong-mayor form of city government.
Springfield's mayor is Domenic J. Sarno, who has been serving since 2008.
The city's governmental bureaucracy consists of 33 departments, which administer a wide array of municipal services, e.g. police, fire, public works, parks, public health, housing, economic development, and the Springfield Public School System, New England's 2nd largest public school system.
Springfield's legislative body is its City Council, which features a mix of eight ward representatives—even though the city has more than twice that many neighborhoods, resulting in several incongruous "wards"—and five at-large city representatives, several of whom have served for well over a decade.
In 2003, the City of Springfield was on the brink of financial default, and thus taken over by a Commonwealth-appointed Finance Control Board until 2009.
Disbanded in June of that year, the Control Board made great strides stabilizing Springfield's finances.
While Springfield has achieved balanced budgets since 2009, the city has not enlarged its tax base, and thus many of its public works projects—which have been in the pipeline for years, some even decades—remain unfinished (e.g., repairs to Springfield's landmark Campanile).
The construction of MGM Springfield, which opened in 2018, fueled a number of projects in the years leading up to and after its opening, with an estimated $3 billion of new development and infrastructure spending materializing.
Building off of the work of the Control Board, the city's finances have remained stable under Mayor Domenic J. Sarno's (2008–present) despite the Great Recession and several natural and man made disasters: June 1, 2011, tornado Springfield Tornado, Hurricane Irene, a freak October snow storm (which in some ways was more damaging than the tornado), and a large gas explosion in the downtown area in 2012.
The city has recovered, however receiving a bond upgrade from Standard and Poor's Investment Services and the GFOA's Distinguished Budget Award for six consecutive years.
Like every other municipality in Massachusetts, Springfield has no judicial branch itself.
Rather, it uses the Springfield-based state courts, which include Springfield district court and Hampden County Superior Court, both of which are based in Springfield.
The Federal District Court also regularly hears cases in Springfield—now in an architecturally award-winning building on State Street, constructed in 2009.
Springfield became a city on May 25, 1852, by decree of the Massachusetts Legislature, after a decade-long internal dispute that resulted in the partition of Chicopee from Springfield, and thus the loss of two fifths of the city's population.
Springfield, like all municipalities in Massachusetts, is subject to limited home rule municipal power.
The current city charter, in effect since 1959, uses a "strong mayor" government with most power concentrated in the mayor, as in Boston and elsewhere.
The mayor representing the city's executive branch presents the budget, appoints commissioners and department heads, and in general runs the city.
The mayor is former City Councilor Domenic Sarno, elected November 6, 2007, by a margin of 52.54% to 47.18% against incumbent Charles Ryan.
He took office in January 2008.
In November 2009 and 2011, Sarno won reelection, albeit—in the latter case—with just 22% of eligible Springfield voters voting.
The Springfield City Council, consisting of thirteen members, is the city's legislative branch.
Elected every odd numbered year, eight of its members are elected to represent "wards", which are made of (sometimes incongruous) groupings of Springfield neighborhoods, e.g. Springfield's ethnic North End neighborhoods—Memorial Square and Brightwood—share a ward with Metro Center, Springfield's downtown.
Five city council members are elected at-large.
The City Council passes the city's budget, holds hearings, creates departments and commissions, and amends zoning laws.
The mayor's office and city council chambers are located in city hall—part of the Municipal Group in Metro Center, Springfield.
The Finance Control Board met there as well.
Springfield is heavily Democratic.
In the 2020 US Presidential Election Democrat Joe Biden received 72.4 percent of the vote to Republican Donald Trump's 25.7 percent.
In the past, efforts have been made to provide each of the city's eight wards a seat in the city council, instead of the current at-large format.
There would still be some at-large seats under this format.
The primary argument for this has been that City Councilors live in only four of the city's wards.
An initiative to change the composition failed to pass the City Council twice.
In 2007 Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosado proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members adding four seats to the existing nine member at large system, but allocated between eight ward and five at large seats.
This home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 8–1, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor.
On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of changing the City Council and School Committee.
The ballot initiative that established a new council with five at-large seats and eight ward seats passed 3–1.
On November 3, 2009, Springfield held its first ward elections in 50 years.
The State Representatives are Orlando Ramos, Carlos González, Bud Williams, and Angelo Puppolo.
The State Senator is Adam Gomez.
Springfield is part of the Eighth Massachusetts Governor's Council district and is represented by Tara Jacobs (D-North Adams).
Richard Neal represents United States House of Representatives, Massachusetts District 1, and Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey represent Springfield in the Federal Senate.
The Springfield Plan for citizenship education drew national attention in the 1940s for its efforts to combat racism.
Springfield has the second-largest school district in Massachusetts and in New England.
It operates 38 elementary schools, six high schools, six middle schools (6–8), and seven specialized schools.
The main high schools in the city include the High School of Commerce, Springfield Central High School, Roger L Putnam Vocational-Technical High School, and the Springfield High School of Science and Technology, better known as Sci-Tech.
There are also two charter secondary schools in the City of Springfield: SABIS International, which ranks among the top 5% of high schools nationally in academic quality, and the Hampden Charter School of Science.
The city is required under a 1970s court order to balance schools racially, which had necessitated busing.
However, since then, the city and the school's population has shifted and many of the neighborhoods are more integrated, calling into question the need for busing at all.
In June 2015, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced $3.2 million in grants to three underperforming middle schools in Springfield.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield operated five Catholic elementary schools in the city, all of which were consolidated into a single entity, St. Michael's Academy, in the autumn of 2009.
The non-denominational Pioneer Valley Christian Academy is located in the suburban Sixteen Acres neighborhood, educating K–12.
Non-sectarian elementary schools within the City of Springfield include the Pioneer Valley Montessori School in Springfield's Sixteen Acres neighborhood and Orchard Children's Corner in suburban Indian Orchard, a Pre-Kindergarten, among others.
The diocese runs Pope Francis Preparatory School (previously Cathedral High School), which is the largest Catholic high school in Western Massachusetts.
Two nonsectarian private schools are also located in Springfield: Commonwealth Academy located on the former campus of the MacDuffie School (which moved to Granby, Massachusetts, in 2011 after 130 years in Springfield), and teaches grades four through twelve, soon to enroll students in grades K–12; and the Academy Hill School, which teaches kindergarten through grade eight.
Within 15 miles (24 km) of Springfield are many private prep schools, which can serve as day schools for Springfield students; they include the Williston Northampton School in Easthampton, Massachusetts; Wilbraham & Monson Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts; and Suffield Academy in Suffield, Connecticut.
The Knowledge Corridor boasts the second-largest concentration of higher learning institutions in the United States, with 32 universities and liberal arts colleges and over 160,000 university students in Greater Hartford–Springfield.
This includes two college consortia, the Five Colleges, and the Cooperating Colleges of Greater Springfield, whose member institutions often collaborate in greater outreach programs.
Within 16 miles (26 km) of Springfield's Metro Center, there are 18 universities and liberal arts colleges, which enroll approximately 100,000 students.
As of 2015, Springfield attracts over 20,000 university students per year.
Its universities and colleges include Western New England University; Springfield College, famous as the birthplace of the sport of basketball (1891) and the nation's first physical education class, (1912); American International College, founded to educate America's immigrant population, is notable as the inventor of the Model Congress program.
UMass Amherst relocated its urban design center graduate program to Court Square in Metro Center.
Several of Greater Springfield's institutions rank among the most prestigious in the world.
For example, Amherst College, 15 miles (24 km) north of Springfield, and Smith College, 13 miles (21 km) north of Springfield, consistently rank among America's top 10 liberal arts colleges.
Mount Holyoke College—the United States' first women's college—consistently ranks among America's Top 15 colleges, and it is located only 9 miles (14 km) north of Springfield.
Hampshire College is located 14 miles (23 km) north of Springfield.
The 30,000-student University of Massachusetts Amherst is located 16 miles (26 km) north of Springfield.

Westfield was the first university in America to admit students without regard to sex, race, or economic status.
Just outside Springfield's northern city limits is Elms College, a Catholic college.
Likewise, just 2 miles (3.2 km) below Springfield's southern city limit in Longmeadow is Bay Path University; both schools were once all-women but are now co-ed.
In 1968, following the Pentagon's controversial closing of the Springfield Armory, Springfielders founded Springfield Technical Community College on 35 acres (14.2 ha) behind the Springfield Armory National Park.
Springfield Technical Community College is the only polytechnic community college in Massachusetts, and was founded to continue Springfield's tradition of technical innovation.
Holyoke Community College, 8 miles (13 km) north of Springfield, offers more traditional community college programming in Greater Springfield, as well as instruction in the culinary arts.
Springfield's largest local newspaper is The Republican, which has also previously been known as the Springfield Union-News & Sunday Republican, from when it merged with the Springfield Union.
Smaller papers such as The Reminder and the Valley Advocate also serve Greater Springfield.
Other newspapers serve specific communities of interest, such as El Pueblo Latino and El Sol Latino, which serve the Hispanic community, as well as Unity First and the AfAm Point of View, both of which serve the African-American community, and The Rainbow Times, which serves Springfield's LGBT community.
Springfield has a long history of broadcast television, including two of the oldest UHF television stations on the air today.
++WFXQ-CD rebroadcasts WWLP.
WWLP-TV 22 WWLP-TV is the NBC affiliate for the area, and also carries subchannel affiliations with The CW and Ion Television.
WWLP-TV is owned and operated by the Nexstar Media Group, and maintains studios in nearby Chicopee (where the station moved from their old studios atop Provin Mountain).
WWLP is the oldest TV station to air regularly scheduled programming in the market, launching its schedule on March 17, 1953, on Channel 61.
WWLP also operated WRLP (UHF 32), a UHF station licensed to Greenfield, whose transmitter was in Winchester, New Hampshire, as well as W69AQ (UHF 69), a low power station that transmitted from the WWLP tower on Provin Mountain.
WGGB 40 WGGB is the ABC and primary Fox, secondary MyNetworkTV affiliate for the area.
WGGB is owned and operated by Gray Television and its studios are on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line.
WGGB (originally WHYN) signed on on April 1, 1953, on Channel 55.
In 1958, WHYN switched to UHF 40.
Guy Gannett Broadcasting bought the station in 1979 and changed its call sign to the current WGGB-TV effective at the start of the following year.
In 2008, WGGB launched a secondary service called "Fox 6", named after its channel position on the local Comcast cable TV lineup.
FOX6 also appears on WGGB's DTV sub-channel 40.2.
WGGB's analog television signal signed off permanently in late November 2008, due to a transmitter failure.
WGGB and WSHM-LD broadcast local news under the branding "Western Mass News", and maintain a relationship with the Springfield Republican.
WSHM-LD 3 WSHM-LD is Springfield's CBS affiliate operated by Hartford's WFSB.
WSHM is owned and operated by Gray Television and shares studios with WGGB on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line.
WSHM-LD and WGGB broadcast local news under the branding "Western Mass News", and maintain a relationship with the Springfield Republican.
WSHM-LD was formerly W67DF, a translator of TBN, before being sold to the Meredith Corporation, WFSB's then-owners.
WSHM-LD is referred to as "CBS 3", denoting its cable channel assignment within the market and to encourage long-time viewers of WFSB to stay with WSHM-LD.
WGBY 57 WGBY is the PBS member station for the area.
WGBY's studios are in downtown Springfield, near Interstate 91 and the Conrail train lines.
WGBY signed on in 1963.
WGBY is owned by the Boston-based WGBH Educational Foundation and is operated by New England Public Media.
WGBY signed off their analog signal permanently in November 2008, to allow for the replacement of transmission antennas.
Springfield proper is serviced exclusively by Comcast cable.
Springfield was formerly wired with a "dual plant" cable system from 1980 until 2001, requiring an A/B switch for each home to watch programming and complicating VCR recordings.
Springfield was home to the first commercially licensed radio station in the United States, and the oldest radio station of any kind in New England: WBZ, which broadcast live from Springfield's luxurious Hotel Kimball at 140 Chestnut Street (now the Kimball Towers Condominiums) before moving to Boston in 1931.
Springfield is called the Crossroads of New England because it is the major shipping nexus from New York City, Boston, Montreal and the Great Lakes (via Albany, New York).
Much of the cargo heading from one of these places to another crosses through the City of Springfield.
As a geographical trade center, Springfield has more advantages than just being equidistant to these other large trade centers—it sits beside the Connecticut River, is located near some of the most fertile farmland in the Northeast, and is served by numerous rail lines and Interstate Highways, including I-90 (Mass Pike) and I-91, which connect New Haven, Hartford, Holyoke, Northampton, and Vermont to Springfield.
One of the few spurs of I-91 in Massachusetts, I-291, runs through Springfield, and provides a secondary connection between I-90 and I-91.
Springfield Union Station, originally opened in 1926 and re-opened in 2017, is served by five Amtrak intercity routes: the Vermonter, which runs from Washington, D.C. to St. Albans, Vermont; the Lake Shore Limited, which runs from Chicago to Boston; the Hartford Line, which runs from Springfield to New Haven; the Valley Flyer, which runs from New Haven to Greenfield; and the Northeast Regional, which runs from Springfield to D.C./Virginia.
Amtrak relocated its operations into Union Station proper from their previous track side station building in June 2019.
CTRail's Hartford Line started operating from Union Station in June 2018, with Springfield as the northern terminus.
Trains operate to New Haven, CT with multiple stops in Connecticut along the way.
The line shares the same route and station listing as the Amtrak route of the same name, and the two are operated in conjunction as a commuter rail service for the region.
The New Haven–Springfield Line was upgraded in conjunction with the launch of the Hartford Line service.
The project received funding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Federal Government, and the State of Connecticut.
Amtrak trains on the route between New Haven and Springfield reach speeds of 110 mph (177 km/h).
In 2011, Springfield Union Station started a $70 million renovation to become an intermodal transportation facility, allowing Peter Pan Bus, Greyhound Bus, and the PVTA to occupy a modern space next to the renovated Union Station.
It was completed in June 2017.
There are no major freight yards in Springfield proper, but Connecticut Southern Railroad and CSX serve CSX's West Springfield yard across the Connecticut River.
The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) is based in Springfield and uses Union Station as its Springfield hub, next to the Gothic arch that denotes the entrance to downtown Springfield.
The PVTA operates nineteen bus routes from Union Station.
The PVTA's Springfield service area includes Springfield, Holyoke, Chicopee, Westfield, West Springfield, Ludlow, Agawam, and East Longmeadow.
With transfers, it is possible to travel into PVTA's northern service area, which includes Northampton, Amherst, and Easthampton.
Intercity bus service is provided by Peter Pan Bus Lines and Greyhound Lines, both of which operate from Union Station.
They provide service to destinations across the northeast United States.
Springfield is primarily served by Bradley International Airport, in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, 12 miles (19 km) south of downtown.
It features over 100 daily departures to 30 destinations on nine airlines.
It is also the primary airport for Hartford.
Westfield-Barnes Regional Airport is 12 miles (19 km) from downtown Springfield in Westfield, Massachusetts.
It is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the Massachusetts Turnpike.
Westover Metropolitan Airport is 5 miles (8 km) from downtown Springfield.
It is 3 miles (5 km) from the Massachusetts Turnpike.
Logan International Airport in Boston is approximately 80 miles (130 km) northeast of Springfield.
Taken in its entirety, Springfield has a moderate Walk Score of 59, however walkability varies between neighborhoods.
Whereas the suburban neighborhood of Sixteen Acres is largely car-dependent with a score of 30, and Indian Orchard has a somewhat walkable rating of 54, the Metro Center area, with its grid central to stores, residences, and businesses, yields a Walk Score of 82.
The city's Connecticut River Walk Park offers a largely uninterrupted bike route from the North to South End, and is part of a broader plan by the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission to create a continuous route alongside the Connecticut River from Agawam to Holyoke, with construction and planning ongoing.
The city recently partnered with Bewegen (an e-bike share system provider) to install e-bike share stations in both Springfield and West Springfield.
The Springfield Water and Sewer Commission (created in its current form in 1996) owns several reservoirs and aqueducts, as well as hydropower and sewage treatment stations.
The city purchased the Springfield Aqueduct Company in 1872.
Borden Brook Reservoir, located in the rural western Hampden County town of Blandford was completed in 1910.
It feeds into the Cobble Mountain Reservoir (completed in 1931) located at the junction of the towns of Blandford, Granville and Russell.
The Wild Cat Aqueduct carries water from the Cobble Mountain Reservoir to a hydroelectric generating station on the Granville–Russell border, at the Little River.
Drinking water flows to the West Parish Water Filtration Plant in Westfield, and is then pumped to holding tanks at the top of Provin Mountain in Agawam.
The 1875 Ludlow Reservoir, also known as Springfield Reservoir, is maintained as an emergency water supply; it is located in Ludlow and fed via the Broad Brook Canal.
SWSC provides retail water in Springfield and Ludlow; wholesale water to Agawam, East Longmeadow, and Longmeadow; partial or peak service to Southwick, Westfield, and West Springfield; and emergency service to Chicopee and Wilbraham.
The Springfield Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services to the city, and is one of the oldest fire departments in the United States.
A subframe is a structural component of a vehicle, such as an automobile or an aircraft, that uses a discrete, separate structure within a larger body-on-frame or unibody to carry specific components like the powertrain, drivetrain, and suspension.
The subframe is typically bolted or welded to the vehicle.
When bolted, it often includes rubber bushings or springs to dampen vibrations.
The primary purposes of using a subframe are to distribute high chassis loads over a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a monocoque body shell and to isolate vibrations and harshness from the rest of the body.
For example, in an automobile with its powertrain contained in a subframe, forces generated by the engine and transmission can be sufficiently damped to prevent disturbing the passengers.
Modern vehicles use separate front and rear subframes to reduce overall weight and cost while maintaining structural integrity.
Additionally, subframes benefit production by allowing subassemblies to be created and later introduced to the main body shell on an automated line.
A simple "axle" type, which usually supports the lower control arms and steering rack.
A perimeter frame, which supports the lower control arms, steering rack, and engine.
A perimeter frame with full support, which supports the lower control arms, steering rack, engine, transmission, and possibly the full suspension, commonly used in front-wheel-drive cars.
Subframes are typically made of pressed steel panels that are thicker than body shell panels and are welded or spot-welded together.
Hydroformed tubes may also be used in some designs.
The revolutionary monocoque, transverse-engined, front-wheel-drive 1959 Austin Mini set the template for modern front-wheel-drive cars by using front and rear subframes to provide accurate road wheel control while maintaining a stiff, lightweight body.
The 1961 Jaguar E-Type (XKE) used a tubular space frame–type front subframe to mount the engine, gearbox, and long bonnet/hood to a monocoque "tub" passenger compartment.
Beginning with the 1960s, subframes saw regular production with General Motors' X- and F-platform bodies, and the Astro/Safari mid-size vans.
Subframes are prone to misalignment, which can cause vibration and alignment issues in the suspension and steering components.
Misalignment is caused by space between the mounting bolts and the mounting hole.
Several companies in the automotive aftermarket, including TyrolSport in the US and Spoon Sports in Japan, offer solutions for subframe misalignment and movement issues.
Subcompact car is a North American classification for cars smaller than a compact car.
It is broadly equivalent to the B-segment (Europe), supermini (Great Britain) or A0-class (China) classifications.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) car size class definition, the subcompact category sits between the "minicompact" and "compact" categories.
The EPA definition of a subcompact is a passenger car with a combined interior and cargo volume of 85–99 cubic feet (2,410–2,800 L).
Current examples of subcompact cars are the Nissan Versa and Hyundai Accent.
The smaller cars in the A-segment/city car category (such as the Chevrolet Spark and Smart Fortwo) are sometimes called subcompacts in the U.S., because the EPA's name for this smaller category — "minicompact" — is not commonly used by the general public.
The prevalence of small cars in the United States increased in the 1960s due to increased imports of cars from Europe and Japan.
Widespread use of the term subcompact coincided with the early 1970s increase in subcompact cars built in the United States.
Early 1970s subcompacts include the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Ford Pinto.
The term subcompact originated during the 1960s.
However, it came into popular use in the early 1970s, as car manufacturers in the United States began to introduce smaller cars into their line-up.
Previously, cars in this size were variously categorized, including "small cars": 120  or "economy cars".
Due to the increasing popularity of small cars imported from Europe and Japan during the late 1960s, the American manufacturers began releasing competing locally-built models in the early 1970s.
The AMC Gremlin was described at its April 1970 introduction as "the first American-built import" and the first U.S. built subcompact car.
Also introduced in 1970 were the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto.
Plans for the subcompact AMC Gremlin pre-dated Vega and Pinto by several years because of AMC's strategy to recognize emerging market opportunities ahead of the competition.
Sales of American-built "low weight cars" (including subcompacts) accounted for more than 30% of total car sales in 1972 and 1973, despite inventory shortages for several models.
The Gremlin, Pinto and Vega were all rear-wheel drive and available with four-cylinder engines (the Pinto was also available with a V6 engine, and the Gremlin was also available with I6 and V8 engines).
The Pontiac Astre, the Canadian-originated re-badged Vega variant was released in the U.S. in September 1974.
Due to falling sales of the larger pony cars (such as the Chevrolet Camaro and first-generation Ford Mustang) in the mid-1970s, the Vega-based Chevrolet Monza was introduced as an upscale subcompact and the Ford Mustang II temporarily downsized from the pony car class to become a subcompact car for its second generation.
The Monza with its GM variants Pontiac Sunbird, Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Starfire, and the Mustang II continued until the end of the decade.
The Chevrolet Chevette was GM's new entry-level subcompact introduced as a 1976 model.
It was an 'Americanized' design from Opel, GM's German subsidiary.
Additionally, subcompacts that were imported and marketed through domestic manufacturers' dealer networks as captive imports included the Renault Le Car and the Ford Fiesta.
In 1978, Volkswagen began producing the "Rabbit" version of the Golf— a modern, front-wheel drive design— in Pennsylvania.
In 1982, American Motors began manufacturing the U.S. Renault Alliance— a version of the Renault 9— in Wisconsin.
Both models benefiting from European designs, development, and experience.
To replace the aging Chevette in the second half of the 1980s, Chevrolet introduced marketed imported front-wheel drive subcompact cars: the Suzuki Cultus (a three-cylinder hatchback, badged as the Chevrolet Sprint) and the Isuzu Gemini (a four-cylinder hatchback/sedan badged as the Chevrolet Spectrum).
Subcompact cars were highly popular in the 1990s due to their affordability and fuel efficiency.
These cars typically had engines under 1.6 liters and were ideal for city driving.
During the 1990s GM offered the Geo brand featuring the Suzuki-built Metro subcompact.
Subcompact cars of the 1990s typically featured a small footprint, lightweight design, and engines with displacements generally under 1.6 liters.
They were designed to provide maximum interior space while maintaining a compact exterior, making them ideal for city driving and parking.

The 1990s focused on fuel efficiency and emissions, leading to innovations in fuel injection and aerodynamics.
These subcompacts set the stage for modern small cars, emphasizing efficiency and reliability.
Because of consumer demand for fuel-efficient cars during the mid- to late-2000s, sales of subcompact cars made them the fastest growing market category in the U.S. In 2006, three major subcompact models were introduced to the market, the Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit, and Nissan Versa.
These models were released by their manufacturers to aim at a group of younger buyers who otherwise shop for used cars.
While fuel prices at the time were increasing, the small cars were planned before fuel prices soared; for example, Honda had announced that it would release a subcompact model as early as 2004.
By 2008, sales of subcompact cars had dramatically increased in the wake of a continuing increase of fuel prices.
At the same time, sales of pickup trucks and large sport utility vehicles had dropped sharply.
By April 2008, sales of Toyota’s subcompact Yaris had increased 46 percent, and Honda’s Fit had a record month with an increase of 54 percent.
However, low fuel prices and the added room in SUVs impacted subcompact sales negatively in the late 2010s.
During this period, industry executives and analysts said that the subcompact car market was returning to historical norms after an unusual period when manufacturers had expanded small car lineups in anticipation of rising demand fueled by rising fuel prices, which has since eased.
In the United States, the segment experienced a 50 percent drop in sales in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019.
In Canada, the subcompact share of the car market shrank to 1.6 percent for the year ending 2020, down from 2.4 percent in 2019.
As a result, manufacturers stopped offering subcompact models and focused on larger cars instead, including subcompact SUVs which offer higher profit margins and a higher average transaction price.
Models that were no longer sold in the United States by the end of the decade include the Mazda 2 (discontinued after 2014), Scion xD (2016), Toyota Prius C (2017), Ford Fiesta (2019), Smart Fortwo (2019), Fiat 500 (2019), Toyota Yaris (2020), Honda Fit (2020), and Chevrolet Sonic (2020).
A sump is a low space that collects often undesirable liquids such as water or chemicals.
A sump can also be an infiltration basin used to manage surface runoff water and recharge underground aquifers.
Sump can also refer to an area in a cave where an underground flow of water exits the cave into the earth.
One common example of a sump is the lowest point in a basement, into which flows water that seeps in from outside.
If this is a regular problem, a sump pump that moves the water outside of the house may be used.
Another example is the oil pan of an engine.
The oil is used to lubricate the engine's moving parts and it pools in a reservoir known as its sump, at the bottom of the engine.
Use of a sump requires the engine to be mounted slightly higher to make space for it.
Often though, oil in the sump can slosh during hard cornering, starving the oil pump.
For these reasons, racing motorcycles and piston aircraft engines are "dry sumped" using scavenge pumps and a swirl tank to separate oil from air, which is also sucked up by the pumps.
A sump can also be found in an aquarium, mainly a reef system.
The sump sits below the main tank and is used as a filter, as well as a holding place of unsightly equipment such as heaters and protein skimmers.
The main advantage of having a sump plumbed into an aquarium is the increase of water in the system, making it more stable and less prone to fluctuations of pH and salinity.
A diving snorkel can have a sump section located below the mouthpiece.
This allows excess moisture from the breath and liquid from the ocean to settle and remain in the sump, so that it does not impair the snorkeler's breathing.
In a nuclear power plant's reactor housing, the role of the sump will be to collect any overflow of primary loop coolant; in this case, monitoring and pumping of the sump is an important part of the reactor's safety system.
In mining the term sump is used to describe a hole made in the floor of a level in a working, in the direction of a lower level either for the purpose of testing the trend of an ore vein, or for the purpose of ventilation.
The equivalent of a sump on a boat is the bilge.
In the human eye, the vitreous humour has a minor role as a metabolic sump.
In caving/potholing terminology, a sump is a permanently flooded section of a cave, such that the caver must submerge under water to reach the other side.
In a foxhole, a grenade sump is a deeper hole dug inside the foxhole into which live grenades can be kicked to minimize damage from the explosion.
In medieval cosmology, the sump was the center of the cosmos, where the dregs and filth descended, with the celestial sphere far exalted above the world of fallen man.
A sun visor is a component of an automobile located on the interior just above the windshield (also known as the windscreen).
They are designed with a hinged flap that is adjustable to help shade the eyes of drivers and passengers from the glare of sunlight.
Starting in 1924, automobiles such as the Ford Model T began to include an exterior sun visor on its closed body versions.
Other early automobiles also had externally attached sun visors to their windshields until 1931, when interior mounts were introduced.
As automobile design advanced with windshields mounted on an angle to lessen wind resistance, the outside or "cadet-type" sun visors were no longer seen on cars starting from 1932.
Henceforth, sun visors were mounted inside the vehicle, making the hinged flap easier to reach and adjust.
Most modern cars have two sun visors, one for the driver's side and a second for the passenger's side, with the rear-view mirror often mounted in between the two sun visors.
Each visor can be lowered to help block light from the sun entering through the windshield.
Some are designed so they can be released from one bracket and be turned towards the side window, covering a small part of the window at the top to block the sunlight shining onto the side of the face.
Some current visors can also be extended along the side window to block sunlight all of the way to the "B" pillar to block the light for the driver or passenger.
The sun visor's flap or core is typically made from pressboard with a piece of metal for its attachment onto a mounting bracket.
Some are made of molded substrates or polypropylene.
The mounting bracket is often a metal rod with a slight bend in the middle and a bracket that attaches it with screws to the sheet metal above the headliner.
The bend in the rod serves to hold the visor flap in the desired position.
The visor flap is covered with a material, most often to complement the interior of the vehicle.
Padding on the sun visors became popular for the extra protection afforded to passengers.
Such safety improvements included Ford's 1956 Lifeguard package and the seat belts, as well as padded dash and visors that were offered by 1957 on Rambler cars.
Some sun visors may incorporate a vanity mirror for the passenger's convenience.
For many years, a visor mounted mirror was among popular dealer-added accessories that provided high-profit margins with the sales staff receiving extra incentives to sell them.
In some cases, a flip-up or sliding cover over the mirror automatically turns on vanity lights, which can be adjusted with a dimmer control (see image).
Visors are also available as an option or as a standard item from manufacturers with a built-in remote garage door control, often referred to as a universal garage door opener.
Aftermarket exterior sun visors are available for trucks as cab visors.
Manufacturers and aftermarket suppliers are offering new sun visors with electronic features such as USB input slots and GPS systems.
A suicide door is an automobile door hinged at its rear rather than the front.
Such doors were originally used on horse-drawn carriages, but are rarely found on modern vehicles, primarily because they are less safe than a front-hinged door.
Being rear-hinged, if the vehicle were moving and the door opened, aerodynamic drag would force the door open, and the driver/passenger would have to lean forward and out of the vehicle to close it.
As seat belts were not in common use at that time, the risk of falling out of the car and into traffic was high, hence the name "suicide door".
Another reason could have been that while a door was open on a city street, a speeding car moving in the same direction as the parked car could rip a front-hinged door off the parked car but someone inside the adjacent seat, even if moving to leave the car, could not get scratched.
However, with a suicide door, someone inside or partially outside the passenger compartment would get struck by the suicide door forcefully swinging back to a shut position due to the impact of the speeding car on the door.
Initially standard on many models, later they became popularized in the custom car trade.
Automobile manufacturers call the doors coach doors (Rolls-Royce and Lincoln), flexdoors (Opel), freestyle doors (Mazda), rear access doors (Saturn), or simply describe them as rear-hinged doors.
Rear-hinged doors were common on cars manufactured in the first half of the 20th century, including the iconic Citroën Traction Avant.
In the era before seat belts, the accidental opening of such doors meant that there was a greater risk of falling out of the vehicle compared to front-hinged doors, where airflow pushed the doors closed rather than opening them further.
Rear-hinged doors were especially popular with mobsters in the gangster era of the 1930s, supposedly owing to the ease of pushing passengers out of moving vehicles with the air around the moving car holding the door open, according to Dave Brownell, the former editor of Hemmings Motor News.
After World War II, rear-hinged doors were mostly limited to rear doors of four-door sedans.
The best-known use of rear-hinged doors on post-World War II American automobiles was the Lincoln Continental 4-door convertibles and sedans (1961–1969), Cadillac Eldorado Brougham (1956–1959) four-door sedans, and Ford Thunderbird (1967–1971) four-door sedans.
The British Rover P4 used rear-hinged doors at the rear.
German Goggomobil saloons and coupes had two-door bodies with rear-hinged doors until 1964.
The French, hand-made Facel Vega Excellence offered a four-door hardtop with a Chrysler-sourced Hemi V8 beginning in 1954.
In 2003, the new Rolls-Royce Phantom car reintroduced independent rear-hinged doors in luxury vehicle applications.
Other luxury models with rear-hinged doors include the Spyker D8 and the Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe four-seat convertible.
The most recent mass-produced model with such doors may be the Opel Meriva, followed by the Rolls-Royce Cullinan in 2018, and a few Chinese electric vehicles including the Singulato iS6 in 2018 and HiPhi X in 2020.
Lincoln announced that 80 limited-edition 2019 Continentals would be made with "coach" doors, marking the Continental's 80th anniversary.
The 2020 Citroen Ami electric vehicle is unusual in having a suicide door for the driver but a conventional door for the passenger, as the doors are identical units that are not differentiated by side.
In the early 2000s, rear-hinged rear doors that are held closed by the front doors, and cannot be opened until released by opening the front door on the same side (hinged at the front), have appeared on a number of vehicles.
Such doors may be referred to as clamshell doors.
Examples include extended-cab pickup trucks, the Saturn SC, Saturn Ion Quad Coupe, Honda Element, Toyota FJ Cruiser, BMW i3, Mini Cooper Clubman, Mazda RX-8, Mazda MX-30 and Fiat 500 3+1.
Rear passenger rear-hinged doors had long been used on Austin FX4 London taxis, discontinued on their successors the TX1, TXII and TX4, but reintroduced in the 2018 LEVC TX.
Several concept cars have featured rear-hinged doors, such as the Lincoln C, a hatchback with no B-pillar and rear-hinged doors at the rear, or the Carbon Motors Corporation E7, a police car with rear rear-hinged doors designed to aid officers getting handcuffed passengers in and out of the back seat.
The Kia Naimo, an electric concept car, also has rear suicide doors.
Other car manufacturers which have produced models with suicide doors include Citroën, Lancia, Opel, Panhard, Rover, Saab, Saturn, Škoda, Studebaker, Ferrari, Mazda and Volkswagen.
Rear-hinged doors make entering and exiting a vehicle easier, allowing a passenger to enter by turning to sit and exit by stepping forward and out.
This is important for passengers who need to make a dignified entrance; the UK State Bentley has rear-opening passenger doors that are broader than usual and open very wide, allowing the monarch to exit the car in a dignified way.
In combination with traditional front doors, rear-hinged doors allow chauffeurs easier access to the rear door.
In Austin FX4 taxis, drivers were able to reach the rear exterior door handle through the driver's window without getting out of the vehicle.
Rear-hinged doors also allow a better position for a person installing a child seat into the back seat of a vehicle than conventional doors, while being simpler and cheaper to build than the sliding doors commonly used on minivans.
The Opel Meriva B compact MPV introduced in 2010 had such doors.
The combination of front-hinged front doors and rear-hinged rear doors allows for a design without the B-pillar, creating a large opening for entering and exiting the vehicle.
When front doors are directly adjacent to rear suicide doors, exiting and entering the vehicle can be awkward if people try to use the front and back doors at the same time.
Aerodynamic factors forcing rear-hinged doors open at speed in older cars.
In 1969, Consumer Reports reported this problem on a Subaru 360.
If a person not wearing a seat belt falls out of a moving car with a coach door, the door can catch them and drag them along the road at speed, causing serious injuries.
If a person exits a vehicle while parallel parked and a car hits the door from the rear, the person would be crushed instead of the door being ripped off.
Car manufacturers mitigate these hazards with such safety features as seat belts, and locks requiring front-hinged doors be open before permitting rear-hinged doors to open.
A supercar, also known as an exotic car, is a type of automobile generally described as a street-legal, luxury superlative performance sports car, both in terms of power, speed, and handling.
The term 'supercar' is therefore frequently used for low-bodied sportscars with powerful, rear mid-mounted engines.
Since the 2000s, the term hypercar has also come into use for the highest performance supercars.
Supercars commonly serve as the flagship model within a vehicle manufacturer's line-up of sports cars and typically feature various performance-related technology derived from motorsports.
Some examples include the Ferrari 458 Italia, Lamborghini Aventador, and
McLaren 720S.
By contrast, automotive journalism typically reserves the predicate 'hypercar' for (very) limited, (two- to low 4-figure) production-number cars, with new-prices in the 21st century often exceeding a million Euros, dollars or pounds.
Contrary to the "regular" range-topping supercars, many hypercars are more rare, even in an exotic car maker's history – appearing as one-offs, like Porsche's Carrera GT, or just occasionally made specialty models, built over and above the marque's typical product line-up, like the Ford GTs or Ferrari's F40, F50 and Enzo lineage.
Very few car makers, like Bugatti and Koenigsegg, only make hypercars.
In the United States, muscle cars were often referred to as "supercars" during the 1960s.
As of 2024, "supercars" is still used in Australia to refer to Australian muscle cars.
The Lamborghini Miura, produced from 1966 to 1973, is often said to be the first supercar.
By the 1970s and 1980s the term was in regular use, if not precisely defined.
One interpretation up until the 1990s was to use it for mid-engine two-seat cars with at least eight cylinders (but typically a V12 engine), a power output of at least 400 bhp (298 kW) and a top speed of at least 180 mph (290 km/h).
Other interpretations state that "it must be very fast, with sporting handling to match", "it should be sleek and eye-catching" and its price should be "one in a rarefied atmosphere of its own" or regard exclusivity (i.e. limited production volumes) as an important characteristic (such as those made by Ferrari or Lamborghini).
Some European manufacturers specialize in only producing supercars, such as McLaren, Pagani, and Koenigsegg.
It is also claimed that the definition of a supercar has always been subjective and a matter of blind prejudice.
During the 1960s, cars that are now considered to be muscle cars were then referred to as supercars.: 
8  The term was sometimes spelled with a capital S.
In 1966 the sixties supercar became an official industry trend.: 
8  For example, the May 1965 issue of the American magazine Car Life includes multiple references to supercars and "the supercar club" and a 1968 issue of Car & Driver magazine refers to "the Supercar street racer gang" market segment.
In the model name of the AMC S/C Rambler, the "S/C" is an abbreviation for "SuperCar".
Since the decline of the muscle car in the 1970s, the word supercar came to mean a car that has high performance: 5  interpretations of the term are for limited-production models produced by small manufacturers for enthusiasts, and, less so, standard-looking cars modified for increased performance.
The 1990s and 2000s saw a rise in American supercars with similar characteristics to their European counterparts.
American sports cars which have risen to be referred to by the supercar name include the Chevrolet Corvette, Dodge Viper, and Ford GT.
Smaller American manufacturers have also made supercars, such as the Saleen S7, SSC Ultimate Aero, SSC Tuatara, Hennessey Venom GT, and Hennessey Venom F5.
During the early 1990s, Japan began to gain global recognition for making high-performance sports cars, but the automotive media first recognized the Honda NSX produced from 1990 to 2005 as Japan's first supercar, with its lightweight mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive, V6 layout.
The NSX was praised for being more reliable and user-friendly than contemporary European supercars.
In the 21st century, other Japanese brands also decided to make their own supercars.
From 2010 to 2012, Lexus produced the Lexus LFA, a two-seat front-engine coupe powered by a 4.8 L (293 cu in) V10 engine producing 553 hp (412 kW; 561 PS).
The 2009–present Nissan GT-R has also been praised as a modern supercar with every day practicality.
It features a twin-turbo V6 producing between 473–710 hp (353–529 kW; 480–720 PS), and has been lauded for its acceleration and handling through its all-wheel-drive drivetrain and dual-clutch transmission.
The second generation of the Honda NSX from 2016 to 2022 marked a change in approach for Honda, by using all-wheel drive, a hybrid powertrain producing up to 602 hp (449 kW; 610 PS), turbocharging and a dual-clutch transmission, elevating the NSX marque to contemporary supercar standards.
Some people consider the 1993 McLaren F1 to be the first hypercar, while others believe the 2005 Bugatti Veyron was the first hypercar.
With a recent shift towards electrification, many recent hypercars use a hybrid drivetrain, a trend started in 2013 by the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder, and LaFerrari, then continued in 2016 with the Koenigsegg Regera, in 2017 with the Mercedes-AMG One, and the McLaren Speedtail.
Modern hypercars such as Pininfarina Battista, NIO EP9, Rimac Nevera, and Lotus Evija have also gone full-electric.
Hypercars have also been used as a base for the Le Mans Hypercar class after rule changes come into effect from 2021.
Studebaker was an American wagon and automobile manufacturer based in South Bend, Indiana, with a building at 1600 Broadway, Times Square, Midtown Manhattan, New York City.
Founded in 1852 and incorporated in 1868 as the Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company, the firm was originally a coachbuilder, manufacturing wagons, buggies, carriages and harnesses.
Studebaker entered the automotive business in 1902 with electric vehicles and in 1904 with gasoline vehicles, all sold under the name "Studebaker Automobile Company".
Until 1911, its automotive division operated in partnership with the Garford Company of Elyria, Ohio, and after 1909 with the E-M-F Company and with the Flanders Automobile Company.
The first gasoline automobiles to be fully manufactured by Studebaker were marketed in August 1912.
: 231  Over the next 50 years, the company established a reputation for quality, durability and reliability.
After an unsuccessful 1954 merger with Packard (the Studebaker-Packard Corporation) and failure to solve chronic postwar cashflow problems, the 'Studebaker Corporation' name was restored in 1962, but the South Bend plant ceased automobile production on December 20, 1963, and the last Studebaker automobile rolled off the Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, assembly line on March 17, 1966.
Studebaker continued as an independent manufacturer before merging with Wagner Electric in May 1967 and then Worthington Corporation in November 1967 to form Studebaker-Worthington.
"The tax list of York County, Pennsylvania, in 1798–9 showed among the taxable were Peter Studebaker Sr. and Peter Studebaker Jr. wagon-makers, which trade later became the foundation of the family fortune and the corporation which now bears his name."
(see Exhibit D)
"John Studebaker, father of the five brothers [that began the Studebaker Corporation] was the son of Peter Studebaker.
(see Exhibit A, p. 13).
John Clement Studebaker (son of Clement Studebaker and Sarah Rensel) was born February 8, 1799, Westmorland, PA, and died in 1877 in South Bend, St. Joseph, IN.
John Studebaker (1799–1877) moved to Ohio in 1835 with his wife Rebecca (née Mohler) (1802–1887).
The five sons were, in order of birth: Henry (1826–1895), Clement (1831–1901), John Mohler (1833–1917), Peter Everst (1836–1897) and Jacob Franklin (1844–1887).
The boys had five sisters.
Photographs of the brothers and their parents are reproduced in the 1918 company history, which was written by Erskine after he became president, in memory of John M.,: 5  whose portrait appears on the front cover.
In 1747 Peter Studebaker built a road through his owned properties known as Broadfording Wagon Road.
The road he built carried heavy traffic to Bakers Lookout's wagon and forging services that were instrumental to expand the west.
The Maryland Historical Trust WA-I-306 writes 04/03/2001, that this road was "One of Washington County's earliest thoroughfares, Broadfording (Wagon) Road was already in existence in 1747."
(see Exhibit I)
The wagon transportation industry boomed.
On the property, Broadfording Wagon Road built in 1740 by Peter Studebaker, went directly through the property to allow access from the home to the factory and to the mill.
Although Peter Studebaker's life in the colonies was short, less than 18 years, the family business flourished through his descendants (see Exhibit M) and apprentices expanded the vast land holdings enlarging the Studebaker family business and its industrious wagon-making region.
Peter's trade secrets were passed from father to son, generation to generation.
The Studebaker family business plan, purchasing, again and again, vast amounts of land, on which they built industrious farms with mills and wagon making facilities and wagon selling facilities, each identical to the Bakers Lookout situation, industrious farms, much acreage, on which one finds the necessary resources, lumber, iron ore, oil shale and land selected with stream, spring, or river to hydropower factories, mills and equipment.
Peter's technology-enabled expansion of the family business through the famous Conestoga and Prairie Schooner wagon designs.
Peter's trade was the stepping-stone that expanded the transportation industry.
Thomas E. Bonsall, wrote "Much more than the story of a family business; it is also, in microcosm, the story of the industrial development of America."
Peter Studebaker died in the mid-1750s.
John M. Studebaker had always viewed the automobile as complementary to the horse-drawn wagon, pointing out that the expense of maintaining a car might be beyond the resources of a small farmer.
In 1918, when Erskine's history of the firm was published, the annual capacity of the seven Studebaker plants was 100,000 automobiles, 75,000 horse-drawn vehicles, and about $10,000,000 worth of automobile and vehicle spare parts ($202,566,372 in 2023 dollars ).
: 85  In the preceding seven years, 466,962 horse-drawn vehicles had been sold, as against 277,035 automobiles,: 87  but the trend was all too clear.
The regular manufacture of horse-drawn vehicles ended when Erskine ordered the removal of the last wagon gear in 1919.: 90  To its range of cars, Studebaker would now add a truck line to replace the horse-drawn wagons.
Buses, fire engines, and even small rail locomotive-kits were produced using the same powerful six-cylinder engines.
In 1895, John M. Studebaker's son-in-law Fred Fish urged for development of 'a practical horseless carriage'.
When, on Peter Studebaker's death, Fish became chairman of the executive committee in 1897, the firm had an engineer working on a motor vehicle.: 
At first, Studebaker opted for electric (battery-powered) over gasoline propulsion.
While manufacturing its own Studebaker Electric vehicles from 1902 to 1911, the company entered into body-manufacturing and distribution agreements with two makers of gasoline-powered vehicles, Garford of Elyria, Ohio, and the Everitt-Metzger-Flanders (E-M-F) Company of Detroit and Walkerville, Ontario.
Studebaker began making gasoline-engined cars in partnership with Garford in 1904.
After taking over E-M-F's Detroit facilities, Studebaker sought to remedy customer dissatisfaction complaints by paying mechanics to visit each disgruntled owner and replace defective parts in their vehicles, at a total cost of US$1 million ($15,209,302 in 2023 dollars ).
The worst problem was rear-axle failure.
Hendry comments that the frenzied testing resulted in Studebaker's aim to design 'for life'—and the consequent emergence of "a series of really rugged cars...
the famous Big Six and Special Six" listed at $2,350 ($35,742 in 2023 dollars ).
: 231  From that time, Studebaker's own marque was put on all new automobiles produced at the former E-M-F facilities as an assurance that the vehicles were well built.
In 1913, the company experienced the first major labor strike in the automotive industry, the 1913 Studebaker strike.
In 1925, the corporation's most successful distributor and dealer Paul G. Hoffman came to South Bend as vice president in charge of sales.
In 1926, Studebaker became the first automobile manufacturer in the United States to open a controlled outdoor proving ground on which, in 1937, would be planted 5,000 pine trees in a pattern that spelled "STUDEBAKER" when viewed from the air.
Also in 1926, the last of the Detroit plant was moved to South Bend under the control of Harold S Vance, vice president in charge of production and engineering.
That year, a new small car, the Erskine Six was launched in Paris, resulting in 26,000 sales abroad and many more in America.: 91  By 1929, the sales list had been expanded to 50 models and business was so good that 90% of earnings were being paid out as dividends to shareholders in a highly competitive environment.
However, the end of that year ushered in the Great Depression that resulted in many layoffs and massive national unemployment for several years.
Plant 3 at Detroit made complete chassis for Special and Big Six models in over 750,000 sq ft (70,000 m2) of floor space and was located between Clark Avenue and Scotten Avenue south of Fort Street.
Plant 5 was the service parts store and shipping facility, plus the executive offices of various technical departments.: 
236  The Detroit facilities were moved to South Bend in 1926,: 91  except that the Piquette Avenue Plant (Plant 10) was retained for assembly of the Erskine between 1927 and 1929 and the Rockne (1931–1933).
Plant 7 was at Walkerville, Ontario, Canada, where complete cars were assembled from components that had been shipped from South Bend and Detroit factories or locally made in Canada, and is in close proximity to the current Ford Windsor Engine Factory.
Output was designated for the Canadian (left-hand drive) and British Empire (right-hand drive) trade.
By locating it there, Studebaker could advertise the cars as "British-built" and qualify for reduced tariffs.: 
237  This manufacturing facility had been acquired from E-M-F in 1910 (see above).
By 1929, it had been the subject of $1.25 million investment and was providing employment that supported 500 families.
From the 1920s to the 1930s, the South Bend company had originated many style and engineering milestones, including the Light Four, Light Six, Special Six, Big Six models, the Dictator, the record-breaking Commander and President, followed by the 1939 Champion.
During World War II, Studebaker produced the Studebaker US6 truck in great quantity and the unique M29 Weasel cargo and personnel carrier.
Studebaker ranked 28th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.
An assembly plant in California, Studebaker Pacific Corporation, built engine assemblies and nacelles for B-17s and PV-2 Harpoons.
After cessation of hostilities, Studebaker returned to building automobiles.
Studebaker prepared well in advance for the anticipated postwar market and launched the slogan "First by far with a post-war car".
This advertising premise was substantiated by Virgil Exner's designs, notably the 1947 Studebaker Starlight coupé, which introduced innovative styling features that influenced later cars, including the flatback "trunk" instead of the tapered look of the time, and a wrap-around rear window.
For 1950 and 1951, the Champion and Commander adopted a polarizing appearance from Exner's concepts, and were applied to the 1950 Studebaker Starlight coupe.
The new trunk design prompted a running joke that one could not tell if the car was coming or going, and appeared to be influenced by the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, particularly by the shortened fuselage with wrap around canopy.
During the war the Studebaker Chippewa Factory was the primary location for aircraft engines used in the Boeing B-17
Flying Fortress and the marketing department attempted to evoke a reference to their contribution to the war effort.
Ballooning labor costs (the company had never had an official United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and Studebaker workers and retirees were among the highest paid in the industry), quality control issues, and the new-car sales war between Ford and General Motors in the early 1950s wrought havoc on Studebaker's balance sheet.
: 254–55  Professional financial managers stressed short-term earnings rather than long-term vision.
Momentum was sufficient to keep going for another 10 years, but stiff competition and price-cutting by the Big Three doomed the enterprise.
From 1950 Studebaker declined rapidly, and by 1954 was losing money.
It negotiated a strategic takeover by Packard, a smaller but less financially troubled car manufacturer.
However, the cash position was worse than it had led Packard to believe, and by 1956, the company (renamed Studebaker-Packard Corporation and under the guidance of CEO James J. Nance) was nearly bankrupt, though it continued to make and market both Studebaker and Packard cars until 1958.: 254  The "Packard" element was retained until 1962, when the name reverted to "Studebaker Corporation".
A three-year management contract was made by CEO Nance with aircraft maker Curtiss-Wright in 1956 with the aim of improving finances due to Studebaker's experience building aircraft engines during the war and military grade trucks.
C-W's president, Roy T. Hurley, attempted to reduce labor costs.
Under C-W's guidance, Studebaker-Packard also sold the old Detroit Packard plant and returned the then-new Packard plant on Conner Avenue (where Packard production had moved in 1954, at the same time Packard took its body-making operations in house after its longtime body supplier, Briggs Manufacturing Company, was acquired by Chrysler in late 1953) to its lessor, Chrysler.
The company became the American importer for Mercedes-Benz, Auto Union, and DKW automobiles and many Studebaker dealers sold those brands, as well.
C-W gained the use of idle car plants and tax relief on their aircraft profits while Studebaker-Packard received further working capital to continue car production.
However, Lark sales began to drop precipitously after the Big Three manufacturers introduced their own compact models in 1960, and the situation became critical once the so-called "senior compacts" debuted for 1961.
The Lark had provided a temporary reprieve, but nothing proved enough to stop the financial bleeding.
A labor strike occurred at the South Bend plant starting on January 1, 1962, and lasting 38 days.
The strike came to an end after an agreement was reached between company president Sherwood H. Egbert and Walter P. Reuther, president of the UAW.
Despite a sales uptick in 1962, continuing media reports that Studebaker was about to leave the auto business became a self-fulfilling prophecy as buyers shied away from the company's products for fear of being stuck with an "orphan".
NBC reporter Chet Huntley made a television program called "Studebaker – Fight for Survival" which aired on May 18, 1962.
By 1963, all of the company's automobiles and trucks were selling poorly.
After insufficient initial sales of the 1964 models and the ousting of president Sherwood Egbert, on December 9, 1963, the company announced the closure of the South Bend plant.
The last Larks and Hawks were assembled on December 20, and the last Avanti was assembled on December 26.
To fulfill government contracts, production of military trucks and Zip Vans for the United States Postal Service continued into early 1964.
The engine foundry remained open until the union contract expired in May 1964.
The supply of engines produced in the first half of 1964 supported Zip Van assembly until the government contract was fulfilled, and automobile production at the Canadian plant until the end of the 1964 model year.
The Avanti model name, tooling, and plant space were sold off to Leo Newman and Nate Altman, a longtime South Bend Studebaker-Packard dealership.
They revived the car in 1965 under the brand name "Avanti II".
(See main article Avanti (car).)
They likewise purchased the rights and tooling for Studebaker's trucks, along with the company's vast stock of parts and accessories.
The plant, alongside Studebaker's General Products Division, was bought by Kaiser Jeep Corporation who used it to produce military vehicles.
That unit formed the nucleus for what would later become AM General Corporation, which today is the world’s largest producer of tactical wheeled vehicles.
Nevertheless, as Newman and Altman decided not to progress with any Studebaker truck production, the tooling was then sold off again to Kaiser Jeep in late 1965, which continued producing parts for Studebaker trucks for a few more years.
Some '1965' model Champ trucks were built in South America using completely knocked-down kits and left-over parts.
These models used a different grille from all previous Champ models.
The closure of the South Bend plant hit the community particularly hard, since Studebaker was the largest employer in St. Joseph County, Indiana.
Nearly a quarter of the South Bend work force was African-American.
Limited automotive production was consolidated at the company's last remaining production facility in Hamilton, Ontario, which had always been profitable and where Studebaker produced cars until March 1966 under the leadership of Gordon Grundy.
It was projected that the Canadian operation could break even on production of about 20,000 cars a year, and Studebaker's announced goal was 30,000–40,000 1965 models.
While 1965 production was just shy of the 20,000 figure, the company's directors felt that the small profits were not enough to justify continued investment.
Rejecting Grundy's request for funds to tool up for 1967 models, Studebaker left the automobile business on March 17, 1966, after an announcement on March 4.
A turquoise and white Cruiser sedan was the last of fewer than 9,000 1966 models manufactured (of which 2,045 were built in the 1966 calendar year).
In reality, the move to Canada had been a tactic by which production could be slowly wound down and remaining dealer franchise obligations honored.
The 1965 and 1966 Studebaker cars used "McKinnon" engines sourced from General Motors Canada Limited, which were based on Chevrolet's 230-cubic-inch six-cylinder and 283 cubic-inch V8 engines when Studebaker-built engines were no longer available.
The closure adversely affected not only the plant's 700 employees, who had developed a sense of collegiality around group benefits such as employee parties and day trips, but the city of Hamilton as a whole; Studebaker had been Hamilton's 10th-largest employer.
In 1965, Gordon Grundy of Studebaker Canada was sent by Studebaker management to Japan to investigate potential links with Nissan and Toyota, to sell their vehicles badged as Studebakers.
While Grundy was negotiating with Nissan to possibly import the Nissan Cedric, the Studebaker board found out about the Toyota Century, which was not introduced until November 1967, and then the attorney representing the board, former United States Vice President Richard Nixon, asked Grundy to contact Toyota, as well.
Toyota was insulted at being Studebaker's second choice, and when word got out to Nissan that Grundy was also speaking with Toyota executives, Nissan ended negotiations, leaving Grundy empty-handed.
Many of Studebaker's dealers either closed, took on other automakers' product lines, or converted to Mercedes-Benz dealerships following the closure of the Canadian plant.
Studebaker's General Products Division, which built vehicles to fulfill defense contracts, was acquired by Kaiser Industries, which built military and postal vehicles in South Bend.
In 1970, American Motors (AMC) purchased the division, which still exists today as AM General.
The grove of 5,000 trees planted on the proving grounds in 1937, spelling out the Studebaker name, still stands and has proven to be a popular topic on such satellite photography sites as Google Earth.
The proving grounds were acquired by Bendix in 1966 and Bosch in 1996.
After Bosch closed its South Bend operation in 2011, a part of the proving ground was retained and, as of April 2013, has been restored to use under the name "New Carlisle Test Facility".
For many years a rumor persisted of the existence of a Studebaker graveyard.
The rumor was later confirmed to be true when the remains of many prototype automobiles and a few trucks were discovered at a remote, heavily wooded site bounded by the proving grounds' high-speed oval.
Most of the prototypes were left to rot in direct contact with the ground and full exposure to the weather and falling trees.
Attempts to remove some of these rusting bodies resulted in the bodies crumbling under their own weight as they were moved, so now they exist only in photographs.
However, there were a few notable exceptions.
A few of the prototypes were rescued.
The only example of a never-produced 1947 Champion wood-sided station wagon was restored and is on display at the Studebaker National Museum.
Another prototype initially slated for disposal at the proving grounds escaped the fate of the others.
In late 1952 Studebaker produced one 1953 Commander convertible as an engineering study to determine if the model could be profitably mass-produced.
The car was based on the 1953 2-door hardtop coupe.
The car was later modified to 1954-model specifications, and was occasionally driven around South Bend by engineers.
Additional structural reinforcements were needed to reduce body flexure.
Even though the car was equipped with the 232 cu.
in. V-8, the added structural weight increased the car's 0-60 mph acceleration time to an unacceptable level.
In addition, the company did not have the financial resources to add another body type to the model line.
The company's leadership mistakenly thought the 2-door sedans, 4-door sedans, and 1954 Conestoga wagon would sell better than the 2-door coupes, so the company's resources were focused on production of the sedans and the wagon.
When the prototype convertible was no longer needed, engineer E. T. Reynolds ordered the car to be stripped and the body sent to the secret graveyard at the proving grounds.
A non-engineering employee requested permission to purchase the complete car, rather than see it rot away with the other prototypes.
Chief engineer Gene Hardig discussed the request with E. T. Reynolds.
They agreed to let the employee purchase the car on the condition that the employee never sell it.
In the 1970s, the car was re-discovered behind a South Bend gas station and no longer owned by the former employee.
After eventually passing through several owners, the car is now in a private collection of Studebaker automobiles.
In May 1967, Studebaker and its diversified units were merged with Wagner Electric.
In November 1967, Studebaker was merged with the Worthington Corporation to form Studebaker-Worthington.
The Studebaker name disappeared from the American business scene in 1979, when McGraw-Edison acquired Studebaker-Worthington, except for the still existing Studebaker Leasing, based in Jericho, NY.
McGraw-Edison was itself purchased in 1985 by Cooper Industries, which sold off its auto-parts divisions to Federal-Mogul some years later.
As detailed above, some vehicles were assembled from left-over parts and identified as Studebakers by the purchasers of the Avanti brand and surplus material from Studebaker at South Bend.
By the early 1960s, Studebaker had begun to diversify away from automobiles.
Numerous companies were purchased, bringing Studebaker into such diverse fields as the manufacture of tire studs and missile components.
Franklin – Appliance Division, Minneapolis, Minnesota (home office; other locations also in Minnesota, Iowa, and Ontario).
Manufactured private label kitchen and laundry appliances for major retailers until it was sold to White Consolidated Industries.
STP – Chemical Compounds Division, Des Plaines, Illinois, and Santa Monica, California.
Produced automotive engine additives.
SASCO – Studebaker Automotive Sales Corp., South Bend, Indiana.
Having built the Wright R-1820 under license during World War II, Studebaker also attempted to build what would perhaps have been the largest aircraft piston engine ever built.
With 24 cylinders in an "H" configuration, a bore of 8 in (203 mm) and stroke of 7.75 in (197 mm), displacement would have been 9,349 cubic inches (153.20 L), hence the H-9350 designation.
It was not completed.
Clement and Henry Studebaker Jr., became blacksmiths and foundrymen in South Bend, Indiana, in February 1852.
: 229  They first made metal parts for freight wagons and later expanded into the manufacture of complete wagons.
At this time, John M. was making wheelbarrows in Placerville, California.
The site of his business is California Historic Landmark #142 at 543 Main St, Placerville.
That was when John M. bought out Henry's share of the business.
Henry was deeply religious and had qualms about building military equipment.
The Studebakers were Dunkard Brethren, conservative German Baptists, a religion that viewed war as evil.
Longstreet's official company history simply says, "Henry was tired of the business.
He wanted to farm.
The risks of expanding were not for him".: 26  Expansion continued from manufacture of wagons for westward migration, as well as for farming and general transportation.
During the height of westward migration and wagon train pioneering, half of the wagons used were Studebakers.
They made about a quarter of them, and manufactured the metal fittings for other builders in Missouri for another quarter-century.
The fourth brother, Peter E, was running a successful general store in Goshen, Indiana, which was expanded in 1860 to include a wagon distribution outlet.: 28  A major leap forward came from supplying wagons for the Union Army in the Civil War (1861–1865).
By 1868, annual sales had reached $350,000 ($11,868,889 in 2023 dollars ).
: 229  That year, the three older brothers formed the Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company—Clem (president), Peter (secretary), and John M. (treasurer).
: 38  By this time, the factory had a spur line to the Lake Shore railroad and, with the Union Pacific Railroad finished, most wagons were now dispatched by rail and steamship.
In 1875, the youngest brother, 30-year-old Jacob, was brought into the company to take charge of the carriage factory, making sulkies and five-glass landaus.
Following a great fire in 1874, which destroyed two-thirds of the entire works, they had rebuilt in solid brick, covering 20 acres (81,000 m2) and were now "The largest vehicle house in the world".
: 43  Customers could choose from Studebaker sulkies, broughams, clarences, phaetons, runabouts, victorias, and tandems.
For $20,000, a four-in-hand for up to a dozen passengers, with red wheels, gold-plated lamps, and yellow trim, could be had.
In the 1880s, roads started to be surfaced with tar, gravel, and wooden blocks.
In 1884, when times were hard, Jacob opened a carriage sales and service operation in a fine new Studebaker Building on Michigan Avenue, Chicago.
The two granite columns at the main entrance, 3 ft 8 in (1.12 m) in diameter and 12 ft 10 in (3.91 m) high, were said to be the largest polished monolithic shafts in the country.
Three years later, Jacob died, the first death among the brothers.
In 1889, incoming President Harrison ordered a full set of Studebaker carriages and harnesses for the White House.
As the 20th century approached, the South Bend plant "covered nearly 100 acres (0.40 km2) with 20 big boilers, 16 dynamos, 16 large stationary engines, 1000 pulleys, 600 wood- and iron-working machines, 7 mi (11 km) of belting, dozens of steam pumps, and 500 arc and incandescent lamps making white light over all".: 
The worldwide economic depression of 1893 caused a dramatic pause in sales and the plant closed down for five weeks, but industrial relations were good and the organized workforce declared faith in their employer.
Studebaker would end the nineteenth century as the largest buggy and wagon works in the world, and by 1900, with around 3,000 workers, the plant in South Bend was producing over 100,000 horse-drawn vehicles of all types yearly.
The wagons pulled by the Budweiser Clydesdales are Studebaker wagons modified to carry beer, originally manufactured circa 1900.
The five brothers died between 1887 and 1917 (John Mohler was the last to die).
Their sons and sons-in-law remained active in the management, most notably lawyer Fred Fish after his marriage to John M's daughter Grace in 1891.
"Col. George M Studebaker, Clement Studebaker Jr, J M Studebaker Jr, and [Fred Sr's son]
Frederick Studebaker Fish served apprenticeships in different departments and rose to important official positions, with membership on the board.

Due to the war effort, and the capacity of the Downtown Facility was dedicated to Studebaker US6 truck and M29 Weasel production, the Chippewa Factory was built south of the city to initially manufacture Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone aircraft engines to be installed in the North American B-25 Mitchell.
Construction began January 1941 and completed in June 1942.
Due to logistics challenges, the initial order was cancelled and Studebaker was asked to build Wright R-1820 Cyclone aircraft engines instead.
Retooling of the factory commenced and by January 1944 was the exclusive location of the Wright R-1820 installed in the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.
After the war ended, the factory was idled until the Korean War began, and the M35 series 2½-ton 6×6 cargo truck resumed in 1950, and the M54 5-ton 6x6 truck was also manufactured at this location.
Ownership of the factory changed hands a few times, but the M35 and M54 stayed in production until they were replaced by the FMTV in 1989.
During World War II, the plant produced aircraft engines for the B-17 Flying Fortress starting in January 1944 until the August 9, 1945 announcement for the building sale.
Studebaker built 63,789 engines at the plant and each had nearly 8,000 finished parts.
The aircraft were equipped with engines known as the Studebaker-built R-1820.
The plant's main building, just west of Midway Airport, contained 782,988 square feet and sat on a 50-acre site.
Although, engine items were fabricated and produced in the Chicago plant, they were sent to South Bend, Indiana for final assembly.
The plant was acquired by Western Electric to produce telephones that were already in backlog orders because of their war efforts.
Studebaker's agreement with the E-M-F Company, made in September 1908,: 47  was a different relationship, one John Studebaker had hoped would give Studebaker a quality product without the entanglements found in the Garford relationship, but this was not to be.
Under the terms of the agreement, E-M-F would manufacture vehicles and Studebaker would distribute them exclusively through its wagon dealers.
The E-M-F gasoline-powered cars proved disastrously unreliable, causing wags to say that E-M-F stood for Every Morning Fix-it, Easy Mark's Favorite, and the like.: 231  Compounding the problems was the infighting between E-M-F's principal partners, Everitt, Flanders, and Metzger.
Eventually in mid-1909, Everitt and Metzger left to start a new enterprise.: 88  Flanders also quit and joined them in 1912, but the Metzger Motor Car Co could not be saved from failure by renaming it the Flanders Automobile Company.
Studebaker's president, Fred Fish, had purchased one-third of the E-M-F stock in 1908 and followed up by acquiring all the remainder from J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1910 and buying E-M-F's manufacturing plants at Walkerville, Ontario, Canada, and across the river in Detroit.
The former Ford Piquette Avenue Plant, located across Brush Street from the old E-M-F plant in the Milwaukee Junction area of Detroit, was purchased from Ford in January 1911 to become Studebaker Plant 10, used for assembly work until 1933.
E-M-F was bought out by Studebaker, which formed Studebaker Canada.
This was followed by rebadging E-M-F's products: the E-M-F as the Studebaker 30, the Flanders as the Studebaker 20 Sales of these rebadged models continued through the end of 1912.
Under the agreement with Studebaker, Garford would receive completed chassis and drivetrains from Ohio and then mate them with Studebaker-built bodies, which were sold under the Studebaker-Garford brand name at premium prices.
Prices listed for the Model G were $3,700 to $5,000 based on the body style used, equal to ($125,471 in 2023 dollars ) to ($169,556 in 2023 dollars ).
Eventually, vehicles with Garford-built engines began to carry the Studebaker name.
Garford also built cars under its own name, and by 1907, attempted to increase production at the expense of Studebaker.
Once the Studebakers discovered this, John Mohler Studebaker enforced a primacy clause, forcing Garford back on to the scheduled production quotas.
The decision to drop the Garford name was made and the final product rolled off the assembly line by 1911, leaving Garford alone until it was acquired by John North Willys in 1913.
In 1938, the company built an assembly location at 4530 Loma Vista Avenue in Vernon, California, which remained in production until 1956.
At one time, the facility was averaging 65 cars a day assembled from knock-down kits shipped by rail from the factory in South Bend, Indiana.
The factory manufactured the Champion, the Land Cruiser, and the Starlight.
During the war, the factory was in close proximity to Douglas Aircraft and Lockheed Aircraft and built engine assemblies and nacelles for B-17s and PV-2 Harpoons.
On August 18, 1948, surrounded by more than 400 employees and a battery of reporters, the first vehicle, a blue Champion four-door sedan, rolled off of the Studebaker assembly line in Hamilton, Ontario.
The company was located in the former Otis-Fenson military weapons factory off Burlington Street on Victoria Avenue North, which was built in 1941.
Having previously operated its British Empire export assembly plant at Walkerville, Ontario, Studebaker settled on Hamilton as a postwar Canadian manufacturing site because of the city's proximity to the Canadian steel industry.
Studebaker manufactured cars in Hamilton from 1948 to 1966.
After the South Bend plant shut, Hamilton was Studebaker's sole factory.
Studebaker briefly manufactured cars in Windsor, Ontario, from 1912 to 1936.
Studebakers were assembled in Melbourne in RHD configuration from CKD kits manufactured at Hamilton, Ontario, Canada beginning in 1960.
The first location was the Canada Cycle and Car Company in the neighborhood of Tottenham, which assembled Studebaker Lark sedans and station wagons, the Studebaker Champ pickup truck and the Studebaker Silver Hawk.
In 1964, after the South Bend, Indiana factory closed, Australian assembly was handed off to Continental & General's factory in West Heidelberg until 1968 when the last car was built.
When the factory ceased operations Renault products were brought in to replace them.
Previously, Studebakers were exported to Australia fully assembled beginning in 1948 in limited numbers.
Studebaker had a long history of selling products in Australia, starting in the 1880s when horse-drawn wagons and carts were imported from the South Bend, Indiana factory, and as the company transitioned to automobiles, they were also brought in.
While Studebaker closed fully its automotive sector in 1969, the company still left a big legacy behind it among classic car enthusiasts.
The Studebaker US6 truck was the basis for the legendary GAZ-51 Soviet truck that was produced in the Soviet Union until 1975, nearly a decade after Studebaker had closed, and proceeded to form the basis for all GAZ trucks later, such as the GAZ-53, GAZ-3307 and 3309 and the GAZon Next.
The designers of the 1993 Dodge Ram stated that the Studebaker E series pickup was their main inspiration for the design.
Subaru (スバル,  or ; Japanese pronunciation: [ˈsɯbaɾɯ]) is the automobile manufacturing division of Japanese transportation conglomerate Subaru Corporation (formerly known as Fuji Heavy Industries), the twenty-first largest automaker by production worldwide in 2017.
Subaru cars are known for their use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1,500 cc.
The Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout was introduced in 1972.
Both became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most markets by 1996.
The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012 via a partnership with Toyota, which pairs the boxer engine with rear-wheel-drive.
Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the WRX, Legacy and Outback XT, Ascent, and formerly the Legacy GT and Forester XT.
In Western markets, Subaru vehicles have traditionally attracted a small but devoted core of buyers.
The company's marketing targets those who desire its signature engine and drive train, all-wheel drive and rough-road capabilities, or affordable sports car designs.
Subaru is the direct translation from Japanese for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or the "Seven Sisters" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI.
Fuji Heavy Industries started out as the Aircraft Research Laboratory in 1915, headed by Chikuhei Nakajima.
In 1932, the company was reorganized as Nakajima Aircraft Company, Ltd and soon became a major manufacturer of aircraft for Japan during World War II.
At the end of the Second World War, Nakajima Aircraft was again reorganized, this time as Fuji Sangyo Co, Ltd.
In 1946, the company created the Fuji Rabbit, a motor scooter, with spare aircraft parts from the war.
In 1950, Fuji Sangyo was divided into 12 smaller corporations according to the Japanese government's 1950 anti-zaibatsu legislation, the Corporate Credit Rearrangement Act.
Between 1953 and 1955, five of these corporations and a newly formed corporation decided to merge to form Fuji Heavy Industries.
These companies were: Fuji Kogyo, a scooter manufacturer; coachbuilder Fuji Jidosha; engine manufacturer Omiya Fuji Kogyo; chassis builder Utsunomiya Sharyo and the Tokyo Fuji Sangyo trading company.
Kenji Kita, CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries at the time, wanted the new company to be involved in car manufacturing and soon began plans for building a car with the development code-name P-1.
Kita canvassed the company for suggestions about naming the P1, but none of the proposals were appealing enough.
In the end he gave the company a Japanese name that he "had been cherishing in his heart": Subaru, which is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster.
The first Subaru car was named the Subaru 1500.
Only twenty were manufactured owing to multiple supply issues.
Subsequently, the company designed and manufactured dozens of vehicles including the 1500 (1954), the tiny air-cooled 360 (1958), the Sambar (1961), and the 1000 (which saw the introduction of the Subaru boxer engine in 1965).
Nissan acquired a 20.7% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru's parent company, in 1968 during a period of government-ordered merging of the Japanese auto industry in order to improve competitiveness under the administration of Prime Minister Eisaku Satō.
Nissan would utilize FHI's bus manufacturing capability and expertise for their Nissan Diesel line of buses.
In turn many Subaru vehicles, even today, use parts from the Nissan manufacturing keiretsu.
The Subaru automatic transmission, known as the 4EAT, is also used in the first generation Nissan Pathfinder.
While under this arrangement with Nissan, Subaru introduced the R-2 (1969), the Rex and the Leone (1971), the BRAT (1978), Alcyone (1985), the Legacy (1989), the Impreza (1993) (and its WRX subtype), and the Forester (1997).
Upon Nissan's alliance with Renault, its stake in FHI was sold to General Motors in 1999.
Troy Clarke of General Motors served as representative to Fuji Heavy Industries on their corporate board.
During that time, Subaru introduced the Baja (2003), and the Tribeca (2005).
The Subaru Forester was sold as a Chevrolet Forester in India in exchange for the Opel Zafira being sold as a Subaru Traviq in Japan.
Also, the Chevrolet Borrego concept was presented in 2002, a crossover coupe/pickup truck being derived from the Japanese-market Legacy Turbo platform.
During the brief General Motors period, a badge engineered Impreza was sold in the United States as the Saab 9-2X. An SUV (Subaru Tribeca/Saab 9-6X) was also planned but the Saab version did not proceed, and styling was recycled in the 2008 Tribeca refresh.
GM liquidated their holdings in FHI in 2005.
Nearly all Saab-Subaru joint projects were dropped at that time, other than Subaru supplying parts for the Saab 9-2x.
Toyota Motors bought a little over 40% of GM's former FHI stock, amounting to 8.7% of FHI.
(The rest of GM's shares went to a Fuji stock buy-back program.)
Toyota and Subaru have since collaborated on a number of projects, among them building the Toyota Camry in Subaru's Indiana U.S. plant beginning in April 2007.
Subaru introduced the Exiga in 2008.
Toyota increased their share of FHI to 16.5% in July 2008.
Subsequently, Toyota and Subaru jointly developed the Subaru BRZ, first sold in January 2012.
Toyota sold the BRZ as the Scion FR-S until 2018, where it was renamed to the Toyota 86 due to the discontinuation of Scion in 2016.
Around the time of Toyota's increased ownership, Subaru also declared that they would no longer develop their own Kei cars and trucks, instead selling rebadged products from Toyota's Daihatsu subsidiary.
This also allowed Subaru, a small manufacturer, to focus on their core of boxer-engined family cars.
The last of Subaru's own kei vehicles to be built was the sixth generation Subaru Sambar, which was taken out of production in March 2012 after 54 years of continuous manufacturing in this category.
Some of the advertising slogans Subaru has used in the past include: "Inexpensive, and built to stay that way" (USA 1970s – early 1980s), "The World's Favourite Four Wheel Drive" (in the UK), "Plus on y pense, plus on a le goût de la conduire" (French: "The more you think about it, the more you want to drive it.") in French Quebec, "We built our reputation by building a better car", "What to Drive", "The Beauty of All-Wheel Drive", "Driven by What's Inside", "Think, Feel, Drive", "Confidence in Motion" (USA early 2010s) and currently "Love.
It's what makes Subaru, Subaru" in North America, "All 4 The Driver" in Australia, "Uncommon Engineering, Uncommon Stability, Uncommon Roadholding, Uncommon Sense" in the UK and "Technology that gives you Confidence in Motion" in Southeast Asia.
In the 1990s, an ad firm hired by Subaru found the all-wheel-drive cars were popular among lesbians.
The company started including subtle marketing to this demographic.
According to Automotive Lease Guide, Subaru ranked second place in vehicles that have the highest overall predicted resale values among all industry and all luxury vehicles for MY 2009.
The awards are derived after carefully studying segment competition, historical vehicle performance and industry trends.
According to a study done by J.D. Power and Associates for the 2008 Customer Retention Study, Subaru ranked at 50.5%, which was above the national average of 48%.
Subaru launched an animation series Wish Upon the Pleiades Hōkago no Pleiades (放課後のプレアデス, Hōkago no Pureadesu, lit.
'After School Pleiades') developed jointly with Gainax.
The 4-part mini episode series was released on YouTube on 1 February 2011.
It featured a magical girl plot with Subaru as a leading protagonist.
Subaru's corporate headquarters are located in Ebisu, Tokyo.
Subaru is distinct from many of its Japanese competitors in that as of early 2016 it still made almost 75% of its cars sold internationally in Japan.
Subaru's facilities designated to automotive manufacturing are located in Ōta, Gunma Prefecture, consisting of four locations: Subaru-chō is where the Subaru BRZ/Toyota 86 is built; having been re-purposed from kei car production, Yajima Plant is where all current Subaru cars are built; Otakita Plant is where commercial kei trucks are built (originally a factory location of Nakajima Aircraft Company); and Oizumi Plant in Oizumi, Gunma Prefecture, is where engines and transmissions are built.
Subaru's major overseas manufacturing facility is located in Lafayette, Indiana; the factory is called Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.
Due to continued sales growth in North American markets, vehicle production capacity at the Lafayette assembly plant is set to expand to 390,000 vehicles annually.
Under the current strategic plan, Subaru will have a total production capacity of 1,026,000 vehicles per year at the end of 2016.
In some Asian countries outside of Japan, Subaru vehicles, parts and accessories are supplied by Motor Image Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tan Chong Motor.
Subaru has entered the Philippine operations started in 1996 under the Columbian Motors Philippines ownership but withdrew in 2000.
Subaru models were temporarily sold in GM Autoworld dealerships from 2000 to 2005.
The brand re-entered the market in 2006 under the new management by Motor Image Pilipinas,
Subaru has seventeen dealerships in the country: Greenhills, Pasig, Manila Bay, Alabang, Davao, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo, Santa Rosa, Batangas, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, General Santos, Cavite, Legazpi, Albay, Camarines Sur, Bacolod, and Pampanga.
Subaru has seen popularity in their SUV line-up in the market in recent years, with the Forester and the XV being one of their popular selling models.
Subaru cars has been exported to China since 2004.
In 2011, Subaru and Chinese automaker Chery intended to establish a 50-50 joint venture to produce Subaru vehicles in China.
The plan was to establish a 30 billion yen facility in Dalian, Liaoning with initial annual capacity of 50,000 cars, that would later expand to 150,000 units.
The initial joint venture proposal was rejected by Chinese authorities, as FHI affiliate Toyota already has two joint ventures in China, which is the maximum amount allowed.
Later in 2012, the proposal was rejected for the second time due to production overcapacity in the country.
Subaru once had a presence in South Korea, established in 2009 in Yongsan, Seoul under Choi Seung-dal.
Sales started in April 2010 with the Legacy, Outback and Forester as the initial lineup for the South Korean market.
They were the fifth Japanese automobile manufacturer to enter after Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi.
According to the company, they delayed their entry due to market dominance by Hyundai and Kia.
By 2012, Subaru Korea announced that they would discontinue selling 2013 car models due to low sales.
On 23 April 2019, Subaru officially opened its production plant in Lat Krabang, Bangkok, Thailand, the plant is a joint venture between Subaru Corporation and Hong Kong-listed Tan Chong International (TCIL), which holds a 74.9 percent stake.
The plant was formerly a Mitsubishi Fuso factory that was repurposed, and will supply Subaru vehicle to markets in Asia, including Australia and New Zealand.
According to media interview with Glenn Tan, the plant will have a maximum capacity of 100,000 vehicles per year, and up to a maximum of 4 models to be manufactured.
Current production in 2019 is planned for 6,000 vehicles for Forester model only.
Indonesia has been supported by PT Plaza Auto Mega since February 2020.
In 1974, Robert Edmiston was finance director at sports car manufacturer Jensen Motors.
When the company went bankrupt, he used a £6,000 redundancy payout to set up International Motors, which acquired the UK franchise for Subaru and Isuzu.
The Coleshill-based company is still the parent for Subaru in the UK.
Official operations began since 1973 & have multiple showrooms across the country.
Subaru of America (SOA) was established in 1968 in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, by Malcolm Bricklin and Harvey Lamm and relocated to Pennsauken, New Jersey, shortly thereafter.
In 1986, SOA relocated to Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and Fuji Heavy Industries (now known as Subaru Corporation) acquired full ownership in 1990.
In 2018, SOA relocated to a brand new headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.
SOA operates regional offices, zone offices and parts distribution centers throughout the United States.
SOA also operates port facilities on both the West and East coasts.
In 1989, Subaru and then-partner Isuzu opened a joint factory in Lafayette, Indiana, called Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, or SIA, which initially manufactured the Subaru Legacy and Isuzu Rodeo.
In 2001 Isuzu sold their stake in the plant to Fuji Heavy Industries for $1 due to flagging sales and it was renamed Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.
SIA has been designated backyard wildlife habitat by the National Wildlife Federation and has achieved a zero-landfill production designation (the first automotive assembly plant in the United States to earn that designation).
Subaru Rally Team Japan led by Noriyuki Koseki (founder of Subaru Tecnica International, STI) ran Subaru Leone coupé, sedan DL, RX (SRX) and RX Turbo in the World Rally Championship between 1980 and 1989.
Drivers for individual rallies included Ari Vatanen, Per Eklund, Shekhar Mehta, Mike Kirkland, Possum Bourne and Harald Demut.
Mike Kirkland finished 6th overall and won the A Group at the 1986 Safari Rally.
That year Subaru was one of the only manufacturers combining 4WD and turbo after Audi's successful quattro system had been introduced in 1980, but Audi withdrew from the WRC after safety concerns and Ford's serious accident early in the 1986 season.
Subaru changed the rally model to Legacy RS for the 1990–1992 period and took part in the first complete season in the World Rally Championship with the same model in 1993.
Modified versions of the Impreza WRX and WRX STi have been competing successfully in rallying.
Drivers Colin McRae (1995), Richard Burns (2001) and Petter Solberg (2003) have won World Rally Championship drivers' titles with the Subaru World Rally Team and Subaru took the manufacturers' title three years in a row from 1995 to 1997.
Subaru's World Rally Championship cars are prepared and run by Prodrive, the highly successful British motorsport team.
Several endurance records were set in the early and mid-nineties by the Subaru Legacy.
The Subaru Justy also holds the world record for the fastest sub 1.0L car without a turbo: 123.224 mph average, it was set in 1989.
Subaru was briefly involved in Formula One circuit racing when it bought a controlling interest in the tiny Italian Coloni team for the 1990 season.
The Coloni 3B's 12-cylinder engine was badged as a Subaru and shared the boxer layout with the company's own engines, but was an existing design built by Italian firm Motori Moderni.
The cars were overweight and underpowered and the partnership broke down before the season finished.
With the rise of rally racing and the Import scene in the US, the introduction of the highly anticipated Subaru Impreza WRX in 2001 was successful in bringing high-performance AWD compact cars into the sports car mainstream.
Subaru supplied a factory-backed team, Subaru Rally Team USA for Rally America and won the driver's title six times, most recently in 2011 with David Higgins.
Grassroots Motorsports awarded Subaru with the Editors' Choice Award in 2002.
Since 2005, Cusco Racing have entered an Impreza and a BRZ in the Super GT championship.
In 2008, the Impreza was the first 4-door and first 4WD vehicle to win a race.
Starting in 2006, Subaru of America (SOA), as the official distributor of Subaru vehicles in the United States participates in the Subaru Road Racing Team (SRRT) with a Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT Spec-B in the Grand-Am Street Tuner class.
In 2010, SRRT campaigns a Subaru Impreza WRX STI in the Grand Sport class.
In 2011, SRRT switched from the hatchback to a 2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI sedan.
On 16 December 2008, it was announced that Subaru would no longer be competing in the World Rally Championships.
The decision was made by Subaru's parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI), partly as a result of the economic downturn but also because it was felt Subaru had achieved its sporting and marketing objectives.
Ikuo Mori denied that alterations to the WRC technical regulations in 2010 or a rumored deterioration in the working relationship with Prodrive had any impact on the decision.
He also said that the possibility of a Subaru car back in the top category of WRC in the future is not zero, but for this moment there can be no assumption of a comeback.
In 2011, Mark Higgins used a stock Impreza to set a lap record at the Isle of Man TT course.
In 2016, Higgins again broke the record in a modified WRX STI.
On 4 May 2012, Subaru Rally Team USA announced that a new rallycross team, Subaru Puma Rallycross Team USA, will participate in the 2012 Global RallyCross Championship season with Dave Mirra, Bucky Lasek, and Sverre Isachsen.
They also competed in the 2014 FIA World Rallycross Championship.
Also in 2012, Subaru became the naming rights sponsor of the chief domestic road cycling competition in Australia, the National Road Series.
The Impreza has won hillclimbs such as the Silverstone Race to the Sky and Mount Washington Hillclimb Auto Race.
In 2008, Subaru introduced their EyeSight collision avoidance system, a type of advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS).
Unlike most such systems, which use radar sensors, EyeSight initially launched with dual CCD cameras mounted at the top of the windshield.
Depth information is derived from the parallax between two video signals and used to judge the distance to the next vehicle for features such as pre-collision braking and adaptive cruise control.
Real-world studies of early EyeSight generations show that this system reduces rear-end crashes with injuries by 85 percent, and reduces pedestrian-related injuries by 35 percent.
As of 2022, Subaru sold 5 million cars equipped with the system, and EyeSight-equipped vehicles account for 91% of total vehicle sales.
In the U.S., the EyeSight system is standard on most models equipped with CVTs, and is also standard on automatic transmission BRZ models.
Unlike some other manufacturers (e.g. Toyota), Subaru North America has not provided clear and consistent branding of their Eyesight generations – though some versions are referenced in their owners manuals.
This makes it challenging to distinguish key differences, performance, and improvements among model years.
Much more detailed information is available in the Japanese EyeSight article.
The 2007 Frankfurt International Motor Show saw Subaru introduce a horizontally opposed, water-cooled, common rail turbodiesel using a variable geometry turbocharger called the Subaru EE engine, the first of its type to be fitted to a passenger car.
Volkswagen had experimented with this idea during the 1950s and made two air-cooled boxer prototype diesel engines that were not turbocharged.
VW installed one engine in a Type 1 and another in a Type 2.
The Subaru engine was rated at 110 kW (150 PS; 148 hp) and 350 N⋅m (260 ft⋅lbf) with a displacement of 2.0 liters.
In March 2008 Subaru offered the Legacy Sedan and Wagon and the Outback Wagon with 2.0 liter turbodiesel in the EU with a 5-speed manual transmission.
In September 2008, Subaru announced that the diesel Forester and diesel Impreza will be introduced at the 2008 Paris Motor Show, with Forester sales to begin October 2008 and diesel Impreza sales to start January 2009 in the UK.
The Forester and Impreza will have a 6-speed manual transmission, whereas the Legacy and Outback have 5-speed manual transmissions.
In June 2006, Fuji Heavy Industries, Inc. (FHI) launched its Subaru Stella Plug-in electric vehicle which is a kei car equipped with a lithium-ion battery pack.
The vehicle has a short range of 56 miles (90 km) but it actually costs more than the Mitsubishi iMiEV, at ¥4,380,000 (US$44,860), including Japanese Government consumption taxes with an exemption of $2,240.
It also qualified for a rebate from the Japanese Government of up to $14,200, bringing the price down to $30,660.
The vehicle is much like the i-MiEV, with a 47-kilowatt motor and a quick-charge capability, but the two-door mini-car has a boxy shape.
FHI set a goal of selling 170 vehicles by March 2010.
In Japan, Subaru tested two electric vehicles called the Subaru R1e and Subaru G4e between 2003 and 2009.
The Subaru Hybrid Tourer Concept is a four-seat vehicle with gull-wing doors that combines a 2-liter turbocharged direct-injection gasoline engine with a continuously variable transmission and two axle-mounted motors.
A lithium-ion battery pack provides energy storage for the vehicle.
In early 2018, Subaru, along with Suzuki, Daihatsu and Hino Motors, joined the nascent EV C.A. Spirit venture to collaborate on electric vehicle technology development.
The project was launched by Toyota, Mazda and automotive component manufacturer Denso in September 2017.
In the U.S., the short-lived Crosstrek hybrid was on the market only for the 2014 to 2017 model years.
In 2018, for the 2019 model year, Subaru unveiled the 2019 model year Crosstrek Plug-in Hybrid, based in large part on technology from shareholder Toyota's Prius Prime platform.
The EV range is 27 km (17 mi).
It is only available in California and parts of the East Coast.
Subaru's first all-electric car, named Solterra, is the first vehicle to be based on the e-Subaru Global Platform (e-SGP) co-developed by Toyota and Subaru.
The Solterra debuted at the Los Angeles Auto Show on 17 November 2021, and worldwide sales of the Solterra commenced in mid-2022.
Since the 2005 model year, Subaru has adopted CAN bus technology for the US and Canada markets.
Starting in the 2007 model year, all Subaru vehicles use the CAN technology.
Typically, two CAN-buses are used on vehicles: a high-speed CAN running at 500 kbit/s for powertrain communication, and a low-speed CAN running at 125 kbit/s for body control functions and instrument panels.
A body-integrated unit (BIU) is used between these two networks.
Clarion and Harman Kardon are among the audio, video, and navigation technology suppliers for Subaru products in North America.
Clarion announced in 2015 that it was introducing its "Smart Access" platform, formerly only offered on Clarion's aftermarket products, to the units to be installed in certain Subaru 2015 models in North America.
Smart Access is able to work with the driver's smartphone (either iPhone or Android) and allows access to various car-safe apps running on the phone via the car's built-in infotainment screen.
Subaru and Clarion have also, with Liberty Mutual Insurance, introduced the "RightTrack" in-vehicle app which will be able to monitor the driver's habits, make suggestions for safer driving, and possibly offer insurance discounts.
Subaru debuted its new chassis design, dubbed the Subaru Global Platform, with the release of the 2017 model year Impreza.
Having spent over a billion dollars on research and development the company plans to extend the architecture to all of its other models, with the exception of the BRZ which is co-developed with Toyota.
By incorporating high-strength steel into the chassis updated vehicles will have stiffer bodies that increase safety through greater impact absorption while also improving ride comfort.
Another focus of the new platform is modularity, allowing Subaru to reduce development costs by streamlining production throughout its network of facilities.
The platform will be able to accommodate a variety of powertrains, including gasoline, hybrid, and fully electric designs.
Subaru claims to have implemented advanced policies which include recycling, reducing harmful emissions, and educating their employees.
Their efforts have helped them in their environmental initiatives.
The Subaru plant in Lafayette, Indiana (SIA) was the first auto assembly plant to achieve zero-landfill status; nothing from the manufacturing process goes into a landfill.
The company has developed a recycling plan for the "end-of-life" of their cars.
Most of their modern products use highly recyclable materials throughout the vehicle, in the engine, transmission, suspension and elsewhere in each vehicle leaving Subaru with a 97.3% recycling ratio rate for their end-of-life vehicles.
Subaru currently offers a Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV) certified Legacy, Outback, Impreza, XV/Crosstrek and Forester models which are available for sale anywhere in the U.S. Subaru PZEV vehicles meet California's Super-Ultra-Low-Emission Vehicle exhaust emission standard.
All other models have been certified LEV2.
Subaru has partnered with various manufacturers over time.
Below are some of the models sold in Asia and Europe.
In Japan they are in the Kei car class with either front or all wheel drive and a straight engine.
An article posted by Autoblog on 16 April 2008, stated that due to a corporate investment by Toyota, all Kei cars built by Subaru will be replaced by Daihatsu models beginning in 2010.
A sunroof is a movable panel that opens to uncover a window in an automobile roof, allowing light and fresh air to enter the passenger compartment.
Sunroofs can be manually operated or motor driven, and are available in many shapes, sizes and styles.
While the term "sunroof" is now used generically to describe any moveable panel in the roof, the term "moonroof" was historically used to describe stationary glass panes rigidly mounted in the roof panel over the passenger compartment.
A moonroof has a glass panel that is transparent and usually tinted.
Previous terms include sunshine roof, sliding head, and sliding roof.
A common configuration for early automobiles included a fixed roof for the rear passenger compartment and an uncovered section for the chauffeur in a style known as Coupe de Ville, Sedanca (two door) or Sedanca de Ville.
An open cabin allowed the driver to be more connected to their surroundings, demonstrated that the car's owner employed a paid driver (one reason chauffeurs wore uniform) and identified the owner through the driver's livery (the other reason for the uniform).
Road speeds were increasing and vehicles were changing from occasional use to full-time transport meaning that they were increasingly being used in bad weather.
In order to provide better shelter for the driver therefore, temporary cover was now demanded.
These part-time roofs, sometimes at first just a stretched piece of leather, became more sophisticated comprising frame elements and leather or water-resistant cloth to form the construction, and installations even included spaces provided to store the parts when not in use.
By the late 1920s, a more convenient version of the temporary roof was often being used where a solid metal panel would slide into a slot at the top of the passenger compartment, sometimes called a de Ville extension.
By the early 1930s, cars were being constructed in the Sedan style comprising a metal one-piece roof without the gap above the driver's cabin.
To provide a similar facility to the earlier Coup de Ville configurations, sliding cloth or metal panels recognisable as the modern sunroof were regularly fitted to Bentley and Rolls-Royce models built by coach builders such as Barker, Gurney Nutting or Park Ward.
In these cars, the continuous roofline, between the windscreen and passenger compartment, was unbroken and so, unlike the Coup de Ville, a coverable opening had to be let into the roof panel itself.
While at first the purpose may still have been to expose the chauffeur, Bentley cars in particular were increasingly sold for owners to drive themselves.
Indeed, some models were provided with a sliding panel for the front seats even though the vehicle had just two-seats.
Early "Derby" Bentley hard-top models were therefore frequently equipped with sliding sunroof panels, possibly more often than not.
The purpose of the sliding panels thus changed from uncovering the chauffeur to allowing the owner to better enjoy their surroundings on fine weather days.
This evolution was eventually not limited to luxury motoring.
The entrepreneur Noel Mobbs laid the foundation of the volume sunroof market when he evolved his coach building business into a company dedicated to the manufacture of sliding roofs in the name of Pytchley.
The Pytchley mechanism was both patented and first publicly demonstrated in 1925.
At first Pytchley used their sliding roof system to build a number of coach-built, custom "tourer saloon" automobiles sold from their premises at 201 - 203 Great Portland Street London.
In 1927 they claimed for a Daimler 20/70 hp that "This roof slides at the touch of a finger and opens up 50% of the roof area giving greater visibility and more air without draughts."
The sliding roof system evolved from a device that Pytchley installed themselves, to an option which manufacturers offered as a standard body style.
It was factory fitted to vehicles from a number of different manufacturers.
By 1929 the design had improved so that when closed the moveable panel was flush with the rest of the roof.
Morris built several models using Pytchley's technology from 1932, including the Morris Minor, Morris Major and Morris Ten adding what became known as a Sliding Head (using the term head in the same way as Folding Head or Drop Head).
This comprised a panel which could be slid back over the roof behind to create an opening above the driver and passenger.
The sliding panel also incorporated locks which allowed the panel to be fixed at any position from fully closed to fully open.
By 1935 Wolseley were using the Pytchley roof and by 1936 Austin too were also selling models with the sliding head.
The Hillman Minx was another low-cost small car which was clearly not designed to be chauffeured, and in 1931 it was offered in a variety of body styles as was usual at that time, among the options was a sliding roof section including, on the 1933 Aero model with glass panels, as photographed on the 1932 show car, making this the first moonroof.
In 1941 Pytchley took on the manufacturer Vauxhall for failure to pay royalties.
Vauxhall claimed that their variation of the sliding roof, which slid the panel under the rear section rather than over, was sufficiently different to mean that a license need not be paid.
Pytchley won the case.
Sunroofs, by historical definition are opaque.
Today, most factory sliding sunroof options feature a glass panel and are sometimes marketed as moonroofs, a term introduced in 1973 by John Atkinson, a marketing manager at Ford for the Continental Mark IV.
For the first year, Ford sent out its Mark IVs to American Sunroof Company for offline installation.
Variations of both the sunroof and moonroof have become the norm in both factory installed and aftermarket offerings, creating a wide range of features and choices.
Sunroof systems may be manual or electric, while most moonroof systems are electric/electronic.
Manual sunroofs may be lever actuated, as in venting type pop-ups, manual lever or crank operated for sliding systems.
Electric roof systems are usually cable driven by a motor and feature some form of sliding opening.
Most moonroof systems today are electric and have either a combination pop-up/inbuilt or a pop-up/spoiler configuration (see sunroof types below).
Roof systems may be original equipment, factory options (provided by the car company), or installed aftermarket by a roof installation professional for the car dealer or retail customer.
Once the vehicle leaves the assembly line, the factory option can no longer be integrated into the roof, making aftermarket the only option.
Pop-up sunroofs are simply a manually operated tilting panel.
These panels are sometimes removable, and like T-roofs, must be stored when removed.
The tilting action provides a vent in the roof, or a full opening when the panel is removed.
Pop-ups can be installed in most vehicles, and are relatively inexpensive.
Examples include metal panels in the Porsche 944, the early Mazda RX-7, and many glass panel factory and aftermarket installations.
Spoiler sunroofs (tilt-&-slides) combine the features of a pop-up with those of a sliding roof system.
They tilt to vent and slide open above the roof, requiring little headroom or roof length.
Spoilers typically do not provide as large an opening as other roof systems, but offer the convenience of a self-storing panel.
Most spoiler roofs are electric, with optional features like integrated sun shades and express open/close.
Spoilers are ideal for short-roof vehicles where other types of sliders cannot be installed.
Examples include the Honda CRX, the Toyota Celica and the Mazda RX-7.
Inbuilt sunroof systems have a panel which slides between the metal roof and interior headliner, requiring some loss of headroom but providing a full opening in the roof.
All inbuilts slide inside the roof, while some also include a rear venting feature (see pop-up) or express open/close functions.
Inbuilts do not fit every vehicle, as the panel must slide and store completely within the vehicle roof.
Historically, inbuilts were a metal sunroof panel painted to match the vehicle roof, but now most are glass-panel systems with sliding sunshades (typically referred to as moonroofs).
One of the first examples was the 1960 Ford Thunderbird.
Folding sunroofs (often called rag-tops or cabrio coach) are a European tradition.
They offer the convenience of a sunroof, with an opening more like a convertible.
The panel is made of fabric (often vinyl), which folds back as it slides open.
After a long absence in European and North American markets, folding sunroofs have experienced a resurgence with several new factory-installed options.
Aftermarket versions were once only manual, but now are also available in powered versions.
Examples include the original VW Beetle, Renault Twingo and Jeep Liberty.
Top-mount sliding sunroofs (rail mount topslider) have been a popular factory option in Europe for many years.
A large glass panel slides open in tracks on top of the roof, with no loss of headroom.
Most feature an integral wind deflector to eliminate wind noise.
Examples include Donmar's original Skyroof topslider (aftermarket system), the London Taxi and Renault 5 cars.
Panoramic roof systems are a type of large or multi-panel moonroof which offer openings above both the front and rear seats and may be operable or fixed glass panels.
An early example visually very similar to many current versions was paraded around the Monaco Grand Prix circuit in 1969, it comprised a full-length fixed Plexiglas panel and was fitted to a Lamborghini Espada.
The first example of a panoramic roof however was incorporated into the 1953 Lincoln XL-500 concept car which sported a full-length Plexiglas bubble canopy.
Large operable openings are often accomplished with top-slider (tracks in the top of the roof) or spoiler type mechanisms.
Examples include the Acura ZDX, Lexus ES, BMW Mini, Scion tC, Pontiac G6, Mercedes C Class, Volkswagen Eos, Porsche Cayenne, and the Tesla Model S. Removable roof panels (t-tops or targa roofs) open a vehicle roof to the side windows, providing a wider opening than other roof systems.
The Targa body style is identical in configuration to the Sedanca but is designed for owner-driven rather than chauffeured cars and while a Sedanca style implies a rear passenger area, the Targa does not.
T-roofs have two removable panels and leave a T-shaped structural brace in the roof center.
Targa roofs include only one (opaque or transparent) panel and leave no cross brace.
Aftermarket kits are no longer made, but several companies sell replacement and remanufactured panels, parts and accessories.
Examples include Triumph TR4, Porsche 911 Targa, Suzuki Cappuccino, Toyota Supra, Pontiac Firebird, Chevrolet Corvette, Honda NSX, and Porsche 914.
Solar sunroofs are made of glass, with an inlaid photovoltaic solar panel that makes the glass totally opaque.
They operate the same as conventional factory-fitted glass moonroofs (tilting and retracting), but when closed the solar panel provides electricity to power the interior ventilation fans, for cooling the car interior on hot days when the car is standing outside in the sunlight.
These are available as a factory option on the 2010 Prius, recent Audi cars, Renault Zoé, and also were available on some versions of the Mazda Millenia and Mazda 929.
Electric vs. electronic Motorized power roof systems may be operated by a simple push-and-hold switch, or may include an electronic control module (ECM) to provide single-touch express opening, express closing, or auto-closing on ignition off.
Moonroof is a transparent, usually glass or Plexiglas, sunroof that lets light in while closed.
Examples include the Mk1 Ford Fiesta from 1976, the Mk3 Ford Escort from 1980, the Acura ILX, and Pontiac G6.
The earliest example, although not called moonroof at the time, was the 1933 Hillman Aero Minx which could be fitted with a sliding roof panel including inset glass.
An early use of a large-panel transparent roof section was the 1954 Ford Skyliner and Mercury Sun Valley models which borrowed in-part from the full panoramic roof of the Lincoln XL-500 concept car as well as the X-100.
A fixed moonroof exclusively for rear seat passengers was a prominent feature of the Aston Martin Lagonda from series 2, to 4 which was launched in 1976.
Swan doors or swan-wing doors are a type of door on performance cars or concept cars.
Swan doors operate in a similar way to conventional car doors, but they open at an upward angle.
The design helps to clear curbs, especially on lower sports cars, by opening slightly upward and away from the curb.
The name comes from their resemblance when open to a swan with its wings open.
Although there is no formal definition, swan doors are generally considered to be different from butterfly or scissor doors as they are hinged below the A pillar, open both upward and outward, and do not tilt outward like butterfly doors.
The most well known usage of swan doors is by Aston Martin, and their sister company Lagonda, who have used the design on many of their models, starting with the DB9 in 2004.
A number of cars from other manufacturers have also used the design, such as the Hennessey Venom GT and Vencer Sarthe.
Some concept cars have used swan doors as well, including the Bentley EXP 10 Speed 6 and EXP 12 Speed 6e, Nissan URGE, Bertone Nuccio, and Lamborghini Asterion.
A T-bucket (or Bucket T) is a hot rod, based on a Ford Model T built from 1915 to 1927, but extensively modified.
T-buckets were favorites for greasers.
Model Ts were hot-rodded and customized from the 1920s on, but the T-bucket was specifically created and named by Norm Grabowski in the 1950s.
This car was named Lightning Bug, better known as the Kookie Kar, after being redesigned by Grabowski and appearing in the TV show 77 Sunset Strip, driven by character Gerald "Kookie" Kookson.
The exposure it gained led to numerous copies being built.
A genuine T-bucket has the two-seater body of a Model T roadster (with or without the turtle deck or small pickup box), this "bucket"-shaped body shell giving the cars their name.
A Model T-style radiator is usually fitted, and even these can sometimes be barely up to the task of cooling the large engines fitted.
Windshields, when fitted, are vertical glass like the original Model T. Today, T-buckets remain common.
They generally feature an enormous engine for the size and weight of the car, generally a V8, along with tough drivetrains to handle the power and large rear tires to apply that power to the road.
The front wheels are often much narrower than the rear wheels, and are often motorcycle wheels.
Since the last Model Ts were built in 1927, most modern T-buckets use replica fiberglass bodies.
By the 1950s, original steel Model T bodies that had not been completely worn out were becoming increasingly hard to find and in 1957 the first fiberglass T-Bucket body (based on the 1923 version) was introduced by the short-lived Diablo Speed Shop in Northern California.
Of the only two or three bodies built by Diablo, one was purchased by Southern California hot rod builder Buzz Pitzen and became the world's first fiberglass T-bucket.
Most are built purely for street or show use, and the big engines are more for show than for need — many are more powerful than the vehicles can use.
Although the body shell is original in appearance, engines of a wide variety of makes are commonly used.
The small-block Chevrolet is a common choice, since it is relatively small, light, easy to obtain and to improve, and performs well.
Four-cylinder engines are also common, especially if the car is used regularly.
Some install superchargers on their engines, and some use modern fuel-injected engines.
A song celebrating the car, "Bucket 'T'," was written by Don Altfeld, Jan Berry, Roger Christian and Dean Torrence and first recorded by Jan & Dean in 1964.
Subsequent covers of the song were released by Ronny and the Daytonas in November 1964 and by The Who on November 11, 1966, as part of their EP Ready Steady Who.
In an internal combustion engine, a supercharger compresses the intake gas, forcing more air into the engine in order to produce more power for a given displacement.
The current categorization is that a supercharger is a form of forced induction that is mechanically powered (usually by a belt from the engine's crankshaft), as opposed to a turbocharger, which is powered by the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases.
However, up until the mid-20th century, a turbocharger was called a "turbosupercharger" and was considered a type of supercharger.
The first supercharged engine was built in 1878, with usage in aircraft engines beginning in the 1910s and usage in car engines beginning in the 1920s.
In piston engines used by aircraft, supercharging was often used to compensate for the lower air density at high altitudes.
Supercharging is less commonly used in the 21st century, as manufacturers have shifted to turbochargers to reduce fuel consumption and increase power outputs.
There are two main families of superchargers defined according to the method of gas transfer: positive displacement and dynamic superchargers.
Positive displacement superchargers deliver an almost constant level of boost pressure increase at all engine speeds, while dynamic superchargers cause the boost pressure to rise exponentially with engine speed (above a certain threshold).
Another family of supercharger, albeit rarely used, is the pressure wave supercharger.
Roots blowers (a positive displacement design) tend to be only 40–50% efficient at high boost levels, compared with 70-85% for dynamic superchargers.
Lysholm-style blowers (a rotary-screw design) can be nearly as efficient as dynamic superchargers over a narrow range of load/speed/boost, for which the system must be specifically designed.
Positive displacement pumps deliver a nearly fixed volume of air per revolution of the compressor (except for leakage, which typically has a reduced effect at higher engine speeds).
The most common type of positive-displacement superchargers is the Roots-type supercharger.
Other types include the rotary-screw, sliding vane and scroll-type superchargers.
The rating system for positive-displacement superchargers is usually based on their capacity per revolution.
In the case of the Roots blower, the GMC rating pattern is typical.
The GMC rating is based on how many two-stroke cylinders - and the size of those cylinders - that it is designed to scavenge, with GMC's model range including 2–71, 3–71, 4–71 and 6–71 blowers.
The 6–71 blower, for example, is designed to scavenge six cylinders of 71 cu in (1.2 L) each, resulting in an engine with a total displacement of 426 cu in (7.0 L)).
However, because 6–71 is the engine's designation rather than that of the blower, the actual displacement of the blower is less; for example, a 6–71 blower pumps 339 cu in (5.6 L) per revolution.
Other supercharger manufacturers have produced blowers rated up to 16–71.
Dynamic compressors rely on accelerating the air to high speed and then exchanging that velocity for pressure by diffusing or slowing it down.
Electric superchargers use electric motors rather than mechanical power sources.
Fuels with a higher octane rating are better able to resist autoignition and detonation.
As a result, the amount of boost supplied by the superchargers could be increased, resulting in an increase in engine output.
The development of 100-octane aviation fuel, pioneered in the USA in the 1930s, enabled the use of higher boost pressures to be used on high-performance aviation engines and was used to vastly increase the power output for several speed record airplanes.
Military use of high-octane fuels began in early 1940 when 100-octane fuel was delivered to the British Royal Air Force fighting in World War II.
The German Luftwaffe also had supplies of a similar fuel.
Increasing the octane rating became a major focus of aero engine development for the remainder of the war, with later fuels having up to a nominal 150-octane rating.
Using such fuels, aero engines like the Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 and Daimler-Benz DB 605 DC produced power outputs of up to 2,000 hp (1,500 kW).
One disadvantage of forced induction (i.e. supercharging or turbocharging) is that compressing the intake air increases its temperature.
For an internal combustion engine, the temperature of the intake air becomes a limiting factor in engine performance.
Extreme temperatures can cause pre-ignition or knocking, which reduces performance and can cause engine damage.
The risk of pre-ignition/knocking increases with higher ambient air temperatures and higher boost levels.
Turbocharged engines use energy from the exhaust gas that would normally be wasted, compared with a supercharger which mechanically draws power from the engine.
Therefore turbocharged engines usually produce more power and better fuel economy than supercharged engines.
However, turbochargers can cause turbo lag (especially at lower RPM), where the exhaust gas flow is initially insufficient to spin the turbocharger and achieve the desired boost level, thus leading to a delay in the throttle response.
For this reason, supercharged engines are common in applications where throttle response is a key concern, such as drag racing and tractor pulling competitions.
A disadvantage of supercharging is that the engine must withstand the net power output of the engine plus the power to drive the supercharger.
Turbocharged engines are more prone to heat soak of the intake air (since turbocharging can place the hot exhaust components near the intake air system), although this can be overcome through the use of an intercooler.
The majority of aircraft engines used during World War II used mechanically driven superchargers because they had some significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers.
However, the benefit to the operational range was given a much higher priority to American aircraft because of a less predictable requirement on the operational range and having to travel far from their home bases.
Consequently, turbochargers were mainly employed in American aircraft engines such as the Allison V-1710 and the Pratt & Whitney R-2800, which were comparably heavier when turbocharged, and required additional ducting of expensive high-temperature metal alloys in the gas turbine and a pre-turbine section of the exhaust system.
The size of the ducting alone was a serious design consideration.
For example, both the F4U Corsair and the P-47 Thunderbolt used the same radial engine, but the large barrel-shaped fuselage of the turbocharged P-47 was needed because of the amount of ducting to and from the turbocharger in the rear of the aircraft.
The F4U used a two-stage inter-cooled supercharger with a more compact layout.
Nonetheless, turbochargers were useful in high-altitude bombers and some fighter aircraft due to the increased high altitude performance and range.
Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as those of gas turbine engines.
Turbocharged engines also require frequent inspections of their turbochargers and exhaust systems to search for possible damage caused by the extreme heat and pressure of the turbochargers.
Such damage was a prominent problem in the early models of the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress high-altitude bombers used in the Pacific Theater of Operations during 1944–45.
Turbocharged piston engines continued to be used in a large number of postwar airplanes, such as the B-50 Superfortress, the KC-97 Stratofreighter, the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, the Lockheed Constellation, and the C-124 Globemaster II.
In the 1985 and 1986 World Rally Championships, Lancia ran the Delta S4, which incorporated both a belt-driven supercharger and exhaust-driven turbocharger.
The design used a complex series of bypass valves in the induction and exhaust systems as well as an electromagnetic clutch so that, at low engine speeds, a boost was derived from the supercharger.
In the middle of the rev range, a boost was derived from both systems, while at the highest revs the system disconnected the drive from the supercharger and isolated the associated ducting.
This was done in an attempt to exploit the advantages of each of the charging systems while removing the disadvantages.
In turn, this approach brought greater complexity and affected the car's reliability in WRC events, as well as increasing the weight of engine ancillaries in the finished design.
Twincharged engines have occasionally been used in production cars, such as the 2005-2013 Volkswagen 1.4 litre and the 2017-present Volvo B4204T43/B4204T48 2.0 litre four-cylinder engines.
In 1849, G. Jones of Birmingham, England began manufacturing a lobe pump compressor to provide ventilation for coal mines.
In 1860, the Roots Blower Company (founded by brothers Philander and Francis Marion Roots) in the United States patented the design for an air mover for use in blast furnaces and other industrial applications.
This air mover and Birmingham's ventilation compressor both used designs similar to that of the later Roots-type superchargers.
In March of 1878, German engineer Heinrich Krigar obtained the first patent for a screw-type compressor.
The design was a two-lobe rotor assembly with identically-shaped rotors, however the design did not reach production.
Also in 1878, Scottish engineer Dugald Clerk designed the first supercharger which was used with an engine.
This supercharger was used with a two-stroke gas engine.
Gottlieb Daimler received a German patent for supercharging an internal combustion engine in 1885.
Louis Renault patented a centrifugal supercharger in France in 1902.
The world's first series-produced cars with superchargers were the 1.6 litre Mercedes 6/25 hp and 2.6 litre Mercedes 10/40 hp, both of which began production in 1923.
They were marketed as Kompressor models, a term which was used for various models until 2012.
Supercharged racing cars from around this time included the 1923 Fiat 805-405, the 1923 Miller 122 the 1924 Alfa Romeo P2, the 1924 Grand Prix season car from Sunbeam, the 1925 Delage, and the 1926 Bugatti Type 35C. Amongst the most famous supercharged cars is the Bentley 4½ Litre ("Blower Bentley"), which was introduced in 1929.
In 1935, the development of screw-type superchargers reached a milestone when Swedish engineer Alf Lysholm patented a design for a rotary-screw compressor with five female and four male rotors.
In the 21st century, supercharged production car engines have become less common, as manufacturers have shifted to turbocharging to achieve higher fuel economy and power outputs.
For example, Mercedes-Benz's Kompressor engines of the early 2000s (such as the C 230 Kompressor straight-four, C 32 AMG V6, and CL 55 AMG V8 engines) were replaced around 2010 by turbocharged engines in models such as the C 250 and CL 65 AMG models.
However, there are exceptions, such as the Audi 3.0 TFSI supercharged V6 (introduced in 2009) and the Jaguar AJ-V8 supercharged V8 (upgraded to the Gen III version in 2009).
In the 1930s, two-speed drives were developed for superchargers for aero engines providing more flexible aircraft operation.
The arrangement also entailed more complexity of manufacturing and maintenance.
The gears connected the supercharger to the engine using a system of hydraulic clutches, which were initially manually engaged or disengaged by the pilot with a control in the cockpit.
At low altitudes, the low-speed gear would be used, to prevent excessive boost levels.
At higher altitudes, the supercharger could be switched to a higher gear to compensate for the reduced intake air density.
In the Battle of Britain the Spitfire and Hurricane planes powered by the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine were equipped largely with single-stage and single-speed superchargers.
In 1942, two-speed two-stage supercharging with aftercooling was applied to the Rolls Royce Merlin 61 aero engine.
The improved performance allowed the aircraft they powered to maintain a crucial advantage over the German aircraft they opposed throughout World War II, despite the German engines being significantly larger in displacement.
Two-stage superchargers were also always two-speed.
After the air was compressed in the low-pressure stage, the air flowed through a heat exchanger ("intercooler") where it was cooled before being compressed again by the high-pressure stage and then possibly also aftercooled in another heat exchanger.
While superchargers were highly used in the mid-1900s and during WWII, they have largely fallen out of use in modern piston-driven aircraft.
This can largely be attributed to the higher temperature and lighter alloys that make turbochargers more efficient than superchargers, as well as the lower maintenance due to less moving parts.
Due to the reduced air density at higher altitudes, supercharging and turbocharging have often been used in aircraft engines.
For example, the air density at 30,000 ft (9,100 m) is 1⁄3 of that at sea level, resulting in 1⁄3 as much fuel being able to be burnt in a naturally aspirated engine, therefore the power output would be greatly reduced.
A supercharger/turbocharger can be thought of either as artificially increasing the density of the air by compressing it or as forcing more air than normal into the cylinder every time the piston moves down on the intake stroke.
Since a supercharger is usually designed to produce a given amount of boost at high altitudes (where the air density is lower), the supercharger is often oversized for low altitude.
To prevent excessive boost levels, it is important to monitor the intake manifold pressure at low altitude.
As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the throttle can be progressively opened to obtain the maximum safe power level for a given altitude.
The altitude at which the throttle reaches full open and the engine is still producing full rated power is known as the critical altitude.
Above the critical altitude, engine power output will reduce as the supercharger can no longer fully compensate for the decreasing air density.
Another issue encountered at low altitudes (such as at ground level) is that the intake air is warmer than at high altitude.
Warmer air reduces the threshold at which engine knocking can occur, especially in supercharged or turbocharged engines.
Methods to cool the intake air at ground level include intercoolers/aftercoolers, anti-detonant injection, two-speed superchargers and two-stage superchargers.
In supercharged engines which use a carburetor, a partially-open throttle reduces the air pressure within the carburetor.
In cold conditions, this low pressure air can cause ice to form at the throttle plate.
Significant quantities of ice can cause engine failure, even with the engine operating at full rated power.
A swing axle is a simple type of independent suspension, almost always for the rear axles, designed and patented by Edmund Rumpler in 1903.
This was a revolutionary invention in automotive suspension, allowing driven (powered) wheels to follow uneven road surfaces independently, thus enabling the vehicle's wheels to maintain better road contact and holding; plus each wheel's reduced unsprung weight  means their movements have less impact on the vehicle as a whole.
The first automotive application was the Rumpler Tropfenwagen, later followed by the Mercedes 130H/150H/170H, the Standard Superior, the Volkswagen Beetle and its derivatives, the Chevrolet Corvair, and the roll-over prone M151 jeep amongst others.
Some later automobile rear swing axles have universal joints connecting the driveshafts to the differential, which is attached to the chassis.
Swing axles do not have universal joints at the wheels — the wheels are always perpendicular to the driveshafts; the design is therefore not suitable for a car's front wheels, which require steering motion.
Nevertheless, a simplified variant, wherein the differential remained fixed to one of the halfshafts, was offered optionally on the 1963 Jeep Wagoneer's front axle, upon its market introduction.
Swing axle suspensions conventionally used leaf springs and shock absorbers, though later Mercedes-Benz applications used coil springs.
It was also used in early aircraft (1910 or before), such as the Sopwith and Fokker, usually with rubber bungee and no damping.
A great amount of single-wheel camber change is experienced relative to beam axle designs, since the radius of the jointed half-shaft is less than half that of the whole axle assembly.
"Jacking" on suspension unloading (or rebound) causes positive camber changes on both sides, which (In extreme cases) can overturn the car.
Change in camber due to cornering forces can cause loss of rear-wheel adhesion leading to oversteer—a dynamically unstable condition that can cause a vehicle to spin.
This is an especially severe problem when a swing axle is used in a rear-engine design, because of the greater side-g forces on the rear wheels from the mass of the engine.
Camber changes during deceleration can increase the severity of lift-off oversteer.
Anti-roll bar:
As a design option, a front anti-roll bar which can ameliorate the swing axle car's handling—shifting weight transfer to the front outboard tyre, considerably reducing rear slip angles—thereby avoiding potential oversteer.
Single-pivot point:
Mercedes-Benz addressed the handling issues by producing swing axles with a single-pivot point located under the differential, thus well below the axle.
This configuration markedly reduced the tendency to "jack-up" and the later low pivot swing-axle equipped cars were praised in contemporary publications for their handling.
The low-pivot swing-axle remained in production with Mercedes-Benz W108 280SE and 300SEL until 1972.
It was fitted to the 300SEL 6.3, which was during the early 1970s the world's fastest production sedan.
AMG-modified 6.3s were also raced with the stock swing axle.
Tyre pressure differential:  The Renault Dauphine, Volkswagen Beetle and first generation Chevrolet Corvair (1960–1964) used a tyre pressure differential strategy to eliminate oversteer characteristics of their swing axle suspensions—specifically low front and high rear tyre pressure—which induced understeer.
The tyre pressure differential strategy offered a significant disadvantage: owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re-introduce oversteer characteristics by over-inflating the front tyres (that is, to typical pressures for other cars with other suspension systems) or by inflating all four tyres to the same pressure.
The effectiveness of this option was criticized in lawsuits in the US during the 1960s.
Z-bar and roll-inducing springs:
Mercedes-Benz introduced, to help their low-pivot swing-axle, a coil spring mounted transversely above the differential, which would transfer load from one side to the other, so as to force down one wheel when the other side went up.
This coil spring increases the load bearing capacity of the rear suspension, so a new lower pressure set of springs was substituted for the usual ones to maintain ride suppleness.
A similar effect was achieved by VW's Z-bar, as opposed to anti-roll bar.
Both devices distribute the response of the rear axles to input on one wheel, thus reducing the tendency for excessive camber to occur on one wheel.
These solutions represent a compromise between swing axle and beam axle characteristics, at the cost of decreasing ride quality.
Camber compensator:
A transverse leaf spring is connected to the outer ends of the half-shafts and below the suspension assembly, resisting positive camber that could result from cornering forces or rebound.
This was a successful solution introduced on the 1964 Corvair, and also factory-installed on Porsche 356
Super 90s and some later models.
Aftermarket camber compensators are available for Porsche, VW and early Corvairs.
Ralph Nader in his 1965 book Unsafe at Any Speed detailed accidents and lawsuits related to the shortcomings in 1960–1963 models of the first generation Chevrolet Corvair's swing-axle design.
Nader identified a Chevrolet engineer who had fought management after the management had eliminated a front anti-roll bar for cost reasons.
The 1964 models were fitted with a front anti-roll bar as standard equipment, in addition to a rear transverse leaf spring, thus improving stability during emergency maneuvering.
Second-generation Corvairs (1965–1969) used a true independent rear suspension (IRS) system.
The Hillman Imp designers learned from the problems with the Corvair, having crashed one at a relatively low speed, and they designed their rear-engined car with a semi-trailing arm suspension at the rear.
To attain correct handling balance, they actually used swing-axle geometry at the front, with the steering pivots mounted at the outer ends of single swing wishbones.
These caused too much understeer and uneven tyre wear, and modifications were made to reduce the positive camber of the front wheels by lowering the swing-axle pivot points.
Aftermarket kits were also available to do this, and an inexpensive alternative was to insert a tapered shim to change the inclination of the kingpin carrier relative to the wishbone.
Swing axles were supplanted in general use by de Dion tube axles in the late 1960s, though live axles remained the most common.
Most rear suspensions have been replaced by more modern independent suspensions in recent years, and both swing and de Dion types are virtually unused today.
One exception is the Czech truck manufacturer Tatra, which has been using swing axles on a central 'backbone' tube since 1923 (model Tatra 11) instead of more common solid axles.
This system is claimed to give greater rigidity and better performance on poor quality roads and off-road.
There the inherent reduced stability on roads is compensated by an increased stability on rough terrain, allowing for higher off-road speeds, all else being equal.
This is especially manifested in long 6+ wheel vehicles where off-road chassis twisting can be a major issue.
Another use of the swing axle concept is Ford's "Twin I-Beam" front suspension for trucks.
This system has solid axles, and may transmit power in four-wheel-drive versions, where it is called "Twin Traction Beam".
It is an independent suspension system, as each tyre rises and falls without affecting the position of the other.
Although each tyre still moves in an arc as in a standard swing-axle suspension, the lower control arms effectively are lengthened by attaching the axle pivot point to the bottom of the opposite frame rail (i.e., the left lower control arm pivots on the right frame rail and vice versa).
The lowered pivot point and longer arm length reduce the change in camber and the effect is far less hazardous than powered swing axles for the rear wheels listed above, where the pivot point is approximately on the same side frame rail.
The Twin I-Beam suspension includes an additional radius arm link on each side to control caster.
Although the camber change is reduced with the Twin I-Beam suspension, the A-arm suspension system constrains the wheel into a parallelogram motion, further minimizing camber changes throughout suspension travel.
The 1956 Series 1 Lotus Eleven sports racers used a swing-axle front suspension, derived from the Ford E93 sedan.
A T-top (UK: T-bar) is an automobile roof with a removable panel on each side of a rigid bar running from the center of one structural bar between pillars to the center of the next structural bar.
The panels of a traditional T-top are usually made of auto grade safety glass (tempered or laminated), or acrylic – but they can also be black or body-colored and made of other (often light-weight) materials.
The 1968 Chevrolet Corvette coupe was the first  U.S.-built production automobile to feature a T-top roof.
This increased the popularity of the coupe, such that it outsold the convertible and later led to the discontinuation of the Corvette convertible after 1975 until it was revived in 1986.
Post-C3 models were built with a targa top instead of a T-top.
Swimming is a popular recreational activity and competitive sport that involves moving through water using various techniques.
It offers numerous health benefits, such as strengthened cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and increased flexibility.
It is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels.
Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.
As a formalized sport, swimming is featured in various local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.
Swimming involves repeated motions known as strokes to propel the body forward.
While the front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest of the four main strokes, other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as training.
Swimming comes with certain risks, mainly because of the aquatic environment where it takes place.
By way of example, swimmers may find themselves incapacitated by panic and exhaustion, both potential causes of death by drowning.
Other dangers may arise from exposure to infection or hostile aquatic fauna.
To minimize such eventualities, most facilities employ a lifeguard to keep alert for any signs of distress.
Swimmers often wear specialized swimwear, although depending on the area's culture, some swimmers may also swim nude or wear their day attire.
In addition, a variety of equipment can be used to enhance the swimming experience or performance, including but not limited to the use of swimming goggles, floatation devices, swim fins, and snorkels.
Since the human body is less dense than water, water can support the body's weight during swimming.
As a result, swimming is "low-impact" compared to land activities such as running.
The density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water.
Swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates drag on the body.
Hydrodynamics is important to stroke technique for swimming faster, and swimmers who want to swim faster or exhaust less try to reduce the drag of the body's motion through the water.
To be more hydrodynamically effective, swimmers can either increase the power of their strokes or reduce water resistance.
However, power must increase by a factor of three to achieve the same effect as reducing resistance.
Efficient swimming by reducing water resistance involves a horizontal water position, rolling the body to reduce the breadth of the body in the water, and extending the arms as far as possible to reduce wave resistance.
Just before plunging into the pool, swimmers may perform exercises such as squatting.
Squatting helps enhance a swimmer's start by warming up the thigh muscles.
Human babies demonstrate an innate swimming or diving reflex from newborn until approximately ten months.
Other mammals also demonstrate this phenomenon (see mammalian diving reflex).
The diving response involves apnea, reflex bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction; in other words, babies immersed in water spontaneously hold their breath, slow their heart rate, and reduce blood circulation to the extremities (fingers and toes).
Because infants are innately able to swim, classes for babies about six months old are offered in many locations.
This helps build muscle memory and makes strong swimmers from a young age.
Swimming can be undertaken using a wide range of styles, known as 'strokes,' and which are used for different purposes or to distinguish between classes in competitive swimming.
Using a defined stroke for propulsion through the water is unnecessary, and untrained swimmers may use a 'doggy paddle' of arm and leg movements, similar to how four-legged animals swim.
Four main strokes are used in competition and recreational swimming: the front crawl, freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly.
Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke, which started as the current breaststroke arms and the legs of the butterfly stroke.
In 1873, John Arthur Trudgen introduced the trudgen to Western swimming competitions.
The butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was considered a variant of the breaststroke until it was accepted as a separate style in 1953.
Butterfly is considered the hardest stroke by many people, but it is the most effective for all-around toning and the building of muscles.
It also burns the most calories and can be the second fastest stroke if practiced regularly.
In non-competitive swimming, there are some swimming strokes, including sidestroke.
The sidestroke, toward the end of the 19th century, changed this pattern by raising one arm above the water first, then the other, and then each in turn.
It is still used in lifesaving and recreational swimming.
Other strokes exist for particular reasons, such as training, school lessons, and rescue, and it is often possible to change strokes to avoid using parts of the body, either to separate specific body parts, such as swimming with only arms or legs to exercise them harder, or for amputees or those affected by paralysis.
Swimming has been recorded since prehistoric times, and the earliest records of swimming date back to Stone Age paintings from around 7,000 years ago.
Written references date from 2000 BCE.
Some earliest references include the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible (Ezekiel 47:5, Acts 27:42, Isaiah 25:11), Beowulf, and other sagas.
In 450 BC, Herodotus described a failed seaborne expedition of Mardonius with the words "…those who could not swim perished from that cause, others from the cold".
The [British Celts] thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of [Batavii], who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. ...
Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake.
This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found, but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful.
However, the [Batavii] swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them.
In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss–German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu (The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read).
There are many reasons why people swim, from a recreational pursuit to swimming as a necessary part of a job or other activity.
Swimming may also be used to rehabilitate injuries, especially various cardiovascular and muscle injuries.
People may also pursue swimming as a career or field of interest.
Some may be gifted and choose to compete professionally and go on to claim fame.
Many swimmers swim for recreation, with swimming consistently ranking as one of the physical activities people are most likely to participate in.
Recreational swimming can also be used for exercise, relaxation, or rehabilitation.
The support of the water and the reduction in impact make swimming accessible for people unable to undertake activities such as running.
Swimming is one of the most relaxing activities, and water is known to calm us and help reduce stress.
Swimming is primarily a cardiovascular/aerobic exercise due to the long exercise time, requiring a constant oxygen supply, except for short sprints where the muscles work anaerobically.
Furthermore, swimming can help tone and strengthen muscles.
Regular swimming can help in weight management and contribute to maintaining a healthy body weight.
(Robinson 2022)
Swimming allows sufferers of arthritis to exercise affected joints without worsening their symptoms.
Swimming is often recommended for individuals with joint conditions or injuries, as the buoyancy of water reduces stress on the joints.
However, swimmers with arthritis may wish to avoid swimming breaststroke, as improper technique can exacerbate arthritic knee pain.
As with most aerobic exercise, swimming reduces the harmful effects of stress.
Swimming also improves health for people with cardiovascular problems and chronic illnesses.
It is proven to impact the mental health of pregnant women and mothers positively.
Swimming can even improve mood.
Although many forms of physical activity have been shown to improve bone density and health, this is where swimming has its downfalls.
Due to the low-impact nature of the sport, studies have demonstrated that bone mass acquisition will be negatively impacted, which could be an issue for adolescent athletes in particular.
Since 2010, the Americans with Disabilities Act has required that swimming pools in the United States be accessible to disabled swimmers.
Swimming is an ideal workout for the elderly, as it is a low-impact sport with very little risk of injury.
Exercise in the water works out all muscle groups, helping with conditions such as muscular dystrophy which is common in seniors.
It is also a common way to relieve pain from arthritis.
Swimming as a sport predominantly involves participants competing to be the fastest over a given distance in a certain period of time.
Competitors swim different distances in different levels of competition.
For example, swimming has been an Olympic sport since 1896, and the current program includes events from 50 m to 1500 m in length, across all four main strokes and medley.
During the season competitive swimmers typically train multiple times per day and week to increase endurance, strength, and preserve fitness.
Furthermore when the cycle of work is completed swimmers go through a stage called taper where intensity is reduced in preparation for competition season.
During taper, focus is on power and water feel.
The sport is governed internationally by the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), and competition pools for FINA events are 25 or 50 meters in length.
In the United States, a pool 25 yards in length is commonly used for competition.
Other swimming and water-related sporting disciplines include open water swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, water polo, triathlon, and the modern pentathlon.
As a popular leisure activity done all over the world, one of the primary risks of swimming is drowning.
Drowning may occur from a variety of factors, from swimming fatigue to simply inexperience in the water.
From 2005 to 2014, an average of 3,536 fatal unintentional drownings occurred in the United States, approximating 10 deaths a day.
Learning basic water safety skills, such as swimming with a buddy and knowing how to respond to emergencies, is essential for swimmers of all levels.
Some occupations require workers to swim, such as abalone and pearl diving, and spearfishing.
Swimming is used to rescue people in the water who are in distress, including exhausted swimmers, non-swimmers who have accidentally entered the water, and others who have come to harm on the water.
Lifeguards or volunteer lifesavers are deployed at many pools and beaches worldwide to fulfil this purpose, and they, as well as rescue swimmers, may use specific swimming styles for rescue purposes.
Swimming is also used in marine biology to observe plants and animals in their natural habitat.
Other sciences use swimming; for example, Konrad Lorenz swam with geese as part of his studies of animal behavior.
Swimming also has military purposes.
Military swimming is usually done by special operation forces, such as Navy SEALs and US Army Special Forces.
Swimming is used to approach a location, gather intelligence, engage in sabotage or combat, and subsequently depart.
This may also include airborne insertion into water or exiting a submarine while it is submerged.
Due to regular exposure to large bodies of water, all recruits in the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard are required to complete basic swimming or water survival training.
Swimming is also a professional sport.
Companies sponsor swimmers who have the skills to compete at the international level.
Many swimmers compete competitively to represent their home countries in the Olympics.
Professional swimmers may also earn a living as entertainers, performing in water ballets.
Locomotion by swimming over brief distances is frequent when alternatives are precluded.
There have been cases of political refugees swimming in the Baltic Sea and of people jumping in the water and swimming ashore from vessels not intended to reach land where they planned to go.
There are many risks associated with voluntary or involuntary human presence in water, which may result in death directly or through drowning asphyxiation.
Swimming is both the goal of much voluntary presence and the prime means of regaining land in accidental situations.
Panic occurs when an inexperienced swimmer or a nonswimmer becomes mentally overwhelmed by the circumstances of their immersion, leading to sinking and drowning.
Occasionally, panic kills through hyperventilation, even in shallow water.
Exhaustion can make a person unable to sustain efforts to swim or tread water, often leading to death through drowning.
An adult with fully developed and extended lungs has generally positive or at least neutral buoyancy, and can float with modest effort when calm and in still water.
A small child has negative buoyancy and must make a sustained effort to avoid sinking rapidly.
Hypothermia, in which a person loses critical core temperature, can lead to unconsciousness or heart failure.
Dehydration from prolonged exposure to hypertonic salt water—or, less frequently, salt water aspiration syndrome where inhaled salt water creates foam in the lungs that restricts breathing—can cause loss of physical control or kill directly without actual drowning.
Hypothermia and dehydration also kill directly, without causing drowning, even when the person wears a life vest.
Blunt trauma in a fast moving flood or river water can kill a swimmer outright, or lead to their drowning.
Around any pool area, safety equipment is often important, and is a zoning requirement for most residential pools in the United States.
Supervision by personnel trained in rescue techniques is required at most competitive swimming meets and public pools.
although now infant swimming lessons are recommended to prevent drowning.
In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Estonia and Finland, the curriculum for the fifth grade (fourth grade in Estonia) states that all children should learn to swim as well as how to handle emergencies near water.
Most commonly, children are expected to be able to swim 200 metres (660 ft)—of which at least 50 metres (160 ft) on their back – after first falling into deep water and getting their head under water.
Even though about 95 percent of Swedish school children know how to swim, drowning remains the third most common cause of death among children.
In both the Netherlands and Belgium swimming lessons under school time (schoolzwemmen, school swimming) are supported by the government.
Most schools provide swimming lessons.
There is a long tradition of swimming lessons in the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch translation for the breaststroke swimming style is even schoolslag (schoolstroke).
In France, swimming is a compulsory part of the curriculum for primary schools.
Children usually spend one semester per year learning swimming during CP/CE1/CE2/CM1 (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade).
In many places, swimming lessons are provided by local swimming pools, both those run by the local authority and by private leisure companies.
Many schools also include swimming lessons into their Physical Education curricula, provided either in the schools' own pool or in the nearest public pool.
In the UK, the "Top-ups scheme" calls for school children who cannot swim by the age of 11 to receive intensive daily lessons.
Children who have not reached Great Britain's National Curriculum standard of swimming 25 meters by the time they leave primary school receive a half-hour lesson every day for two weeks during term-time.
In Canada and Mexico there has been a call to include swimming in public school curriculum.
In the United States there is the Infant Swimming Resource (ISR) initiative that provides lessons for infant children, to cope with an emergency where they have fallen into the water.
They are taught how to roll-back-to-float (hold their breath underwater, to roll onto their back, to float unassisted, rest and breathe until help arrives), while clothed and unclothed.
In ISR they teach the children how to roll with their clothes on, as a simulation, if they were to actually fall in walking or crawling by.
In Switzerland, swimming lessons for babies are popular, to help them getting used to be in another element.
At the competition level, unlike in other countries - such as the Commonwealth countries, swimming teams are not related to educational institutions (high-schools and universities), but rather to cities or regions.
Standard everyday clothing is usually impractical for swimming and is unsafe under some circumstances.
Most cultures today expect swimmers to wear swimsuits.
Men's swimsuits commonly resemble shorts, or briefs.
Men's casual swimsuits (for example, boardshorts) are rarely skintight, unlike competitive swimwear, like jammers or diveskins.
In most cases, boys and men swim with their upper body exposed, except in countries where custom or law prohibits it in a public setting, or for practical reasons such as sun protection.
Modern women's swimsuits are generally skintight, covering the pubic region and the breasts (See bikini).
Women's swimwear may also cover the midriff as well.
Women's swimwear is often a fashion statement, and whether it is modest or not is a subject of debate by many groups, religious and secular.
Competitive swimwear is built so that the wearer can swim faster and more efficiently.
Modern competitive swimwear is skintight and lightweight.
There are many kinds of competitive swimwear for each gender.
It is used in aquatic competitions, such as water polo, swim racing, diving, and rowing.
Wetsuits provide both thermal insulation and flotation.
Many swimmers lack buoyancy in the leg.
The wetsuit provides additional volume at a lower density and therefore improves buoyancy and trim while swimming.
It provides insulation between the skin and water which reduces heat loss.
The wetsuit is the usual choice for those who swim in cold water for long periods of time, as it reduces susceptibility to hypothermia.
Some people also choose to wear no clothing while swimming.
In some European countries public pools allow clothes-free swimming and many countries have beaches where one can swim naked.
It is legal to swim naked in the sea at all UK beaches.
It was common for males to swim naked in a public setting up to the early 20th century.
Today, swimming naked can be a rebellious activity or merely a casual one.
Ear plugs can prevent water from getting in the ears.
Noseclips can prevent water from getting in the nose.
However, using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause disadvantage, so many competitive swimmer choose not to use one.
For this reason, nose clips are primarily used for synchronized swimming and recreational swimming.
Goggles protect the eyes from chlorinated water, and improve underwater visibility.
Tinted goggles protect the eyes from sunlight that reflects from the bottom of the pool.
Swim caps keep the body streamlined and protect the hair from chlorinated water, though they are not entirely watertight.
Kickboards are used to keep the upper body afloat while exercising the lower body.
Pull buoys are used to keep the lower body afloat while exercising the upper body.
Hand paddles are used to increase resistance during arm movements, with the goal of improving technique and power.
Finger paddles have a similar effect to handle paddles however due to their smaller size create less resistance.
They also help with improving a swimmers 'catch' in the water.
Snorkels are used to help improve and maintain a good head position in the water.
They may also be used by some during physical therapy.
Pool noodles are used to keep the user afloat during the time in the water.
Safety fencing and equipment is mandatory at public pools and a zoning requirement at most residential pools in the United States.
Swimming Parachutes are used in competitive training, adding an element of resistance in the water helping athletes to increase power in the strokes central movements.
Inflatable armbands are swimming aids designed to provide buoyancy for the swimmer which helps the wearer to float.
Stuttgart (German: [ˈʃtʊtɡaʁt] ; Swabian:
Schduagert [ˈʒ̊d̥ua̯ɡ̊ɛʕd̥]; names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg.
It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known as the Stuttgarter Kessel (Stuttgart Cauldron) and lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest.
Stuttgart has a population of 632,865 as of 2022, making it the sixth largest city in Germany, while over 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and nearly 5.5 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany.
The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 4 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living; innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities in its Innovation Cities Index; and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status global city in their 2020 survey.
Stuttgart was one of the host cities for the official tournaments of the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.
Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities.
It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks.
The city is known as the "cradle of the automobile".
As such, it is home to famous automobile museums like the Mercedes-Benz Museum and Porsche Museum, as well as numerous auto-enthusiast magazines, which contributes to Stuttgart's status as Germany's "Autohauptstadt" ("car capital city/capital of cars").
The city's tourism slogan is "Stuttgart offers more".
Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo and slogan in March 2008, describing itself as "Das neue Herz Europas" ("The new Heart of Europe").
For business, it describes itself as "Where business meets the future".
In July 2010, the city unveiled a new logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.
Since the seventh millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley.
The Roman Empire conquered the area in AD 83 and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries.
Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the tenth century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses.
Initially overshadowed by nearby Bad Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320.
The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of Württemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918.
Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II.
However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and became the major cultural, economic, industrial, financial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.
Stuttgart is known for its strong high-tech industry, especially in the automotive sector.
It has the highest general standard of prosperity of any German city.
In addition to many medium-sized companies, several major corporations are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, and Mercedes-Benz Group.
Stuttgart is an important financial center; the Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt), and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) is Germany's largest Landesbank.
Stuttgart is also a major transport junction; it is among the most congested conurbations of Europe, and its airport is the sixth-busiest in Germany (2019).
Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants; according to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, "In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner."
40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.
In the rest of Germany, 28.7 % of people are of immigrant background, with a relatively higher percentage living in cities and former western Germany (such as Stuttgart).
Stuttgart, often nicknamed the "Schwabenmetropole" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or "stud farm", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.
In the local dialects of Alemannic German it can be "Schtuegert", and in Swabian German "Stuagart"; with similar variant spellings, usually dropping the central T sound.
As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east.
When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery.
When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the third century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the seventh century.
In 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a "Chan Stada" in a document regarding property.
Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.
Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as "Canstat ad Neccarum" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708.
The etymology of the name "Cannstatt" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita ("foundation"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix "Condi-".
Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near Öhringen.
There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kondâti- "confluence".
In AD 950, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 km (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum.
The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later.
In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.
Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year AD 1108, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes.
Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a "Hugo de Stuokarten".
A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX.
In AD 1219, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden.
In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220.
In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von Württemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry.
His son, Eberhard I "the Illustrious", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of Württemberg.
Eberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men.
After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315.
Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king.
Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain.
With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of Württemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses.
The early 1320s were important years for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the Württemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321.
A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of Württemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights.
At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well.
Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche.
In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of Württemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg.
After the temporary partitions of the County of Württemberg by the Treaties of Nürtingen, Münsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.
In 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle.
Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of Württemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of Württemberg in addition to the County thereof.
All this would be lost to the Württembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich.
Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian
I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514.
Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria.
In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice.
When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene.
That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of Württemberg.
Württemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs.
When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525.
Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart.
He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548.
Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph.
He had grown up in a Württemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image.
To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisekönigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542 to 1544, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square.
Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 ft (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566 to 1575.
In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus.
But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.
The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on.
After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at Nörlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces.
The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia.
Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize Württemberg.
The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population.
The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war.
In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 – about 57% of the population of Württemberg.
Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686.
This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ezéchiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over Württemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.
For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the "Versailles of Swabia", was still under construction.
When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne.
Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine.
When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart.
He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770.
The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here.
Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock.
Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of Württemberg was not present in the city.
In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.
Stuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when Württemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of Württemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.
King Frederick I's Württemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states.
Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the Königsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818.
King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest.
Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the Württemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.
From the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846.
Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822–1830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834–1840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857.
Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well.
When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz.
Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and Württemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.
Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard Mörike.
From 1841 to 1846, the Jubiläumssäule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the Königsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall.
Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim on 22 October 1845.
The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871.
By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark.
This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904.
In 1871, Württemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.
Stuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887.
As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle.
The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first "Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering" in Stuttgart.
In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people.
In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded.
Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.
During World War I, the city was a target of air raids.
In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Rotebühlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians.
The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.
At the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway.
Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne.
When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of Württemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital.
On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly.
In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch.
Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.
Due to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region.
Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker "City of the Abroad Germans" in 1936.
The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.
The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents.
The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps.
The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstraße) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls.
Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery.
The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau.
Other Jews from around Württemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg.
As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over Württemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica.
Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.
Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was ravaged throughout the war by Allied air raids.
For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog.
Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people.
With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front.
In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to Allied bombing raids that could now more easily attack the city.
The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs – including 75 blockbusters – levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm.
In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people.
The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men.
To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.
Today Stuttgart consists to over 40 % of buildings from before World War II, besides all destruction.
The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945.
Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions.
Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945.
Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage of the city.
The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance.
The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed.
The circumstances of what later became known as "The Stuttgart Crisis" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House.
President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established.
The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew.
Stuttgart then became capital of Württemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-Württemberg, from 1945 until 1952.
The military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area.
There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.
An early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House.
His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state).
In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn.
All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949.
The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.
The immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city.
Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter.
Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries.
In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friedrich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstraße 14.
Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations.
It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today.
Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.
On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and Württemberg, South Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital.
Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich.
The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city.
Economic migrants, called "Gastarbeiter", from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the "Wirtschaftswunder" unfolding in West Germany.
These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.
In May 1965 Queen Elizabeth II made a state visit to Stuttgart and nearby Marbach and Schwäbisch Hall.
Her great-grandfather Duke Francis (1837–1900) had been a member of the Württemberg royal family.
In the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history.
Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975.
Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the "German Autumn" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181.
When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the "Todesnacht von Stammheim", "Night of Death at Stammheim".
The trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes.
from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union.
In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Neckarstadion.
Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.
Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world.
In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city.
At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records.
In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany.
Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.
Stuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War.
In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.
Since shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart.
At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city.
Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.
In March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a headquarters at Kurmärker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart.
These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established.
In 1948 the headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart.
In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks.
The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army.
As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.
In 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart.
After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated.
The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States.
The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.
Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM.
In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks.
Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few "enduring communities" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany.
The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks.
From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly "Purple"—as in joint service—since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.
The core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 ft (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48°47′N 9°11′E 115 mi (185 km) to the west and north of Munich.
The city is often described as being "zwischen Wald und Reben" ("between forest and vines") because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.
Stuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartshöhe hill – something rather unique in large German cities.
The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the Württemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Grüner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.
Stuttgart is one of 14 regional centers in Baden-Württemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 km2 (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014.
In addition, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt as well as Ditzingen, Gerlingen, and Korntal-Münchingen in Ludwigsburg District.
Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.
Stuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb).
Its summers are warm, with average highs around 25 °C (77 °F), while its winters are chilly, with daily means just above freezing.
Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain.
On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 °C (48 °F).
Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, the Black Forest, Schurwald, and the Swabian-Franconian Forest act as shields from harsh weather, nevertheless the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days.
Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it had lasted several weeks at a time as recently as 2010.
Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013.
In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as "Hagelflieger" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.
At the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz.
As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west.
Königstraße, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.
The Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534.
Exterior: Romanesque/Gothic; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern.
Reconstructed with simplified interior after World War II.
Altes Schloss (the Old Castle), mostly dating from the late 15th century, some parts date back to 1320.
Renaissance style; reconstructed.
Neues Schloss (the New Castle), completed in 1807.
Baroque/Classicism); reconstructed with modern interior, currently houses government offices.
The cellars with a collection of stone fragments from the Roman times are open to visitors.
Königsbau (the King's Building), 1850.
Classicism; reconstructed; has been housing the "Königsbau Passagen" shopping centre since 2006.
The Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) was designed in 1920; its stark, functional lines are typical of the artistic trend 'Neue Sachlichkeit' (New Objectivity).
Castle Solitude, 1700–1800.
In Baroque/Rococo style.
Ludwigsburg Palace, 1704–1758.
Baroque, with its enormous Baroque garden.
Stuttgart Airport Terminal Building, 2000.
In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen.
At the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists.
Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U.
The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350.
The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens – a total of 61 hectares.
The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.
At the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens.
Planted by King William I of Württemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany.
In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.
Beyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'Höhenpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps).
The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults.
The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.
On the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden.
The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of Württemberg.
It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.
Other parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universität Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-Württemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandshöhe hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Weißenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 m (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300–400 years old).
There are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart.
The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve.
It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [Mühlhausen].
There are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers.

Sustainable transport refers to ways of transportation that are sustainable in terms of their social and environmental impacts.
Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road, water or air transport; the source of energy; and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport (roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and terminals).
Transport operations and logistics as well as transit-oriented development are also involved in evaluation.
Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the environmental and climate impacts of the system.
Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels.
In 2019, about 95% of the fuel came from fossil sources.
The main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union is transportation.
In 2019 it contributes to about 31% of global emissions and 24% of emissions in the EU.
In addition, up to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions have only increased in this one sector.
Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector.
Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smog.
Sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the communities they serve.
Transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections, and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased mobility, with poor households benefiting greatly from low carbon transport options.
The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental, social and economic costs that transport systems pose.
Short-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions controls while long-term goals include migrating transportation from fossil-based energy to other alternatives such as renewable energy and use of other renewable resources.
The entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to sustainability measurement and optimization.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that each year 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided.
Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon, a component of particulate matter, which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change.
The links between greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter make low carbon transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level—both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change; and by improving public health through better air quality.
The term "green mobility" also refers to clean ways of movement or sustainable transport.
The social costs of transport include road crashes, air pollution, physical inactivity, time taken away from the family while commuting and vulnerability to fuel price increases.
Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.
Traffic congestion imposes economic costs by wasting people's time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services.
Traditional transport planning aims to improve mobility, especially for vehicles, and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts.
But the real purpose of transport is access – to work, education, goods and services, friends and family – and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts, and managing traffic congestion.
Communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider program of creating more vibrant, livable, sustainable cities.
Allows the basic access and development needs of individuals, companies and society to be met safely and in a manner consistent with human and ecosystem health, and promotes equity within and between successive generations.
Is affordable, operates fairly and efficiently, offers a choice of transport mode, and supports a competitive economy, as well as balanced regional development.
Limits emissions and waste within the planet's ability to absorb them, uses renewable resources at or below their rates of generation, and uses non-renewable resources at or below the rates of development of renewable substitutes, while minimizing the impact on the use of land and the generation of noise.
Sustainability extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions.
A life-cycle assessment involves production, use and post-use considerations.
A cradle-to-cradle design is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency.
Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development.
According to a series of serious reports by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), sustainable transport can help create jobs, improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes, pedestrian pathways and non-pedestrian pathways, make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient.
It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets, making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.
Transport systems are major emitters of greenhouse gases, responsible for 23% of world energy-related GHG emissions in 2004, with about three-quarters coming from road vehicles.
Data from 2011 stated that one-third of all greenhouse gases produced are due to transportation.
Currently 95% of transport energy comes from petroleum.
Energy is consumed in the manufacture as well as the use of vehicles, and is embodied in transport infrastructure including roads, bridges and railways.
Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.
The first historical attempts of evaluating the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to Theodore Von Karman.
After decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the Von Karman model, Dewulf and Van Langenhove have introduced a model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis.
Chester and Orwath, have developed a similar model based on the first law that accounts the necessary costs for the infrastructure.
The environmental impacts of transport can be reduced by reducing the weight of vehicles, sustainable styles of driving, reducing the friction of tires, encouraging electric and hybrid vehicles, improving the walking and cycling environment in cities, and by enhancing the role of public transport, especially electric rail.
Green vehicles are intended to have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when the environmental impact of a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle this may not be the case.
Electric vehicle technology significantly reduces transport CO2 emissions when comparing battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs).
The extent to which it does this depends on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity.
Lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reductions from BEVs are significant, even in countries with relatively high shares of coal in their electricity generation mix, such as China and India.
As a specific example, a Nissan Leaf in the UK in 2019 produced one third of the greenhouse gases than the average internal combustion car.
The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station.
The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24 km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100 kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17 cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface.
At that power, only a few sections of the road need embedded cables.
Hybrid vehicles, which use an internal combustion engine combined with an electric engine to achieve better fuel efficiency than a regular combustion engine, are already common.
Natural gas is also used as a transport fuel, but is a less promising technology as it is still a fossil fuel and still has significant emissions (though lower than gasoline, diesel, etc.).
Brazil met 17% of its transport fuel needs from bioethanol in 2007, but the OECD has warned that the success of (first-generation) biofuels in Brazil is due to specific local circumstances.
Internationally, first-generation biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions, at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures.
The later generation biofuels however (2nd to 4th generation) do have significant environmental benefit, as they are no driving force for deforestation or struggle with the food vs fuel issue.
In practice there is a sliding scale of green transport depending on the sustainability of the option.
Green vehicles are more fuel-efficient, but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes.
Well-patronized public transport networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles.
Green public transport vehicles including electric trains, trams and electric buses combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices.
Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are cycling and other human-powered vehicles, and animal powered transport.
The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is walking.
Transport on rails boasts an excellent efficiency (see fuel efficiency in transportation).
Cities with overbuilt roadways have experienced unintended consequences, linked to radical drops in public transport, walking, and cycling.
In many cases, streets became void of "life."
Stores, schools, government centers and libraries moved away from central cities, and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services.
As schools were closed their mega-school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic; the number of cars on US roads between 7:15 and 8:15 a.m. increases 30% during the school year.
Yet another impact was an increase in sedentary lifestyles, causing and complicating a national epidemic of obesity, and accompanying dramatically increased health care costs.
Car-based transport systems present barriers to employment in low-income neighbourhoods, with many low-income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford to maintain their income.
In developing countries such as Uganda, researchers have sought to determine factors that could possibly influence travelers to opt for bicycles as an alternative to motorcycle taxis (Bodaboda).
The findings suggest that generally, the age, gender, and ability of the individual to cycle in the first place are key determinants of their willingness to shift to a more sustainable mode.
Transport system improvements that could reduce the perceived risks of cycling were also seen to be the most impactful changes that could contribute towards the greater use of bicycles.
Cities are shaped by their transport systems.
In The City in History, Lewis Mumford documented how the location and layout of cities was shaped around a walkable center, often located near a port or waterway, and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or, later, by rail or tram lines.
In 1939, the New York World's Fair included a model of an imagined city, built around a car-based transport system.
In this "greater and better world of tomorrow", residential, commercial and industrial areas were separated, and skyscrapers loomed over a network of urban motorways.
These ideas captured the popular imagination, and are credited with influencing city planning from the 1940s to the 1970s.
The popularity of the car in the post-war era led to major changes in the structure and function of cities.
There was some opposition to these changes at the time.
The writings of Jane Jacobs, in particular The Death and Life of Great American Cities provide a poignant reminder of what was lost in this transformation, and a record of community efforts to resist these changes.
Lewis Mumford asked "is the city for cars or for people?"
Donald Appleyard documented the consequences for communities of increasing car traffic in "The View from the Road" (1964) and in the UK, Mayer Hillman first published research into the impacts of traffic on child independent mobility in 1971.
Despite these notes of caution, trends in car ownership, car use and fuel consumption continued steeply upward throughout the post-war period.
Mainstream transport planning in Europe has, by contrast, never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility.
For example, the Dutch Transport Structure Scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met "if the contribution to societal welfare is positive", and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic.
Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to land-use planning, notably Curitiba, Brazil, Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Canada.
There are major differences in transport energy consumption between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for private transport than a Chinese urban resident, and almost four times as much as a European urban dweller.
These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of walking, cycling, and public transport use and to enduring features of the city including urban density and urban design.
The cities and nations that have invested most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita fossil fuel use.
The social and economic sustainability of car-based transportation engineering has also been questioned.
Within the United States, residents of sprawling cities make more frequent and longer car trips, while residents of traditional urban neighborhoods make a similar number of trips, but travel shorter distances and walk, cycle and use transit more often.
It has been calculated that New York residents save $19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American.
A less car intensive means of urban transport is carsharing, which is becoming popular in North America and Europe, and according to The Economist, carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles.
Car sharing has also begun in the developing world, where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries.
Companies like Zoom in India, eHi in China, and Carrot in Mexico, are bringing car-sharing to developing countries in an effort to reduce car-related pollution, ameliorate traffic, and expand the number of people who have access to cars.
The European Commission adopted the Action Plan on urban mobility on 30 September 2009 for sustainable urban mobility.
The European Commission will conduct a review of the implementation of the Action Plan in the year 2012, and will assess the need for further action.
In 2007, 72% of the European population lived in urban areas, which are key to growth and employment.
Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants.
Around 85% of the EU's GDP is generated in cities.
Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental (CO2, air pollution, noise) and competitiveness (congestion) terms while at the same time addressing social concerns.
These range from the need to respond to health problems and demographic trends, fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of persons with reduced mobility, families and children.
The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) is a group of 94 cities around the world driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing the health and wellbeing of urban citizens.
In October 2019, by signing the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration, 35 mayors recognized that breathing clean air is a human right and committed to work together to form a global coalition for clean air.
Papers have been written showing with satellite data that cities with subway systems produce much less greenhouse gas.
In 2021 the Institute for Public Policy Research issued a statement saying that car use in the United Kingdom must shrink while active transport and public transport should be used more.
The Department for Transport responded that they will spend 2 billion pounds on active transport, more than ever, including making England and the rest of the UK's railways greener.
UK studies have shown that a modal shift to rail from air could result in a sixty fold reduction in CO2 emissions.
Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.
An example is the modification in available transportation in Freiburg, Germany.
The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.
Improve public transport through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.
Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles.
This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency.
Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.
Other states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidence-based sustainable transportation policies.
In March 2022, an advertising regulation will come into force in France, requiring all advertising materials for automobiles to include one of three standard disclaimers promoting the use of sustainable transport practices.
This applies to all vehicles, including electric vehicles.
In 2028, it will also become illegal to advertise vehicles which emit more than 128 grams of carbon dioxide per-kilometre.
Sustainable transport policies have their greatest impact at the city level.
Some of the biggest cities in Western Europe have a relatively sustainable transport.
In Paris 53% of trips are made by walking, 3% by bicycle, 34% by public transport, and only 10% by car.
In the entire Ile-de-France region, walking is the most popular way of transportation.
In Amsterdam, 28% of trips are made by walking, 31%  by bicycle, 18% by public transport and only 23% by car.
In Copenhagen 62% of people commute to school or work by bicycle.
Outside Western Europe, cities which have consistently included sustainability as a key consideration in transport and land use planning include Curitiba, Brazil; Bogota, Colombia; Portland, Oregon; and Vancouver, Canada.
The state of Victoria, Australia passed legislation in 2010 – the Transport Integration Act – to compel its transport agencies to actively consider sustainability issues including climate change impacts in transport policy, planning and operations.
Many other cities throughout the world have recognized the need to link sustainability and transport policies, for example by joining the Cities for Climate Protection program.
Some cities are trying to become car-free cities, e.g., limit or exclude the usage of cars.
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic pushed several cities to adopt a plan to drastically increase biking and walking; these included Milan, London, Brighton, and Dublin.
These plans were taken to facilitate social distancing by avoiding public transport and at the same time prevent a rise in traffic congestion and air pollution from increase in car use.
A similar plan was adopted by New York City and Paris.
The pandemic's impact on urban public transportation means revenue declines will put a strain on operators' finances and may cause creditworthiness to worsen.
Governments might be forced to subsidize operators with financial transfers, in turn reducing resources available for investment in greener transportation systems.
Sustainable transport is fundamentally a grassroots movement, albeit one which is now recognized as of citywide, national and international significance.
Whereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns, over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues, and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations, including the fast-growing population of older citizens.
Many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise, pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own, or cannot drive cars, and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden.
An organization called Greenxc started in 2011 created a national awareness campaign in the United States encouraging people to carpool by ride-sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage, posts and photography.
Ride-sharing reduces individual's carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars.
At the beginning of the 21st century, some companies are trying to increase the use of sailing ships, even for commercial purposes, for example, Fairtrannsport and New Dawn Traders They have created the Sail Cargo Alliance.
The European Investment Bank committed €314 million between 2018 and 2022 to green marine transport, funding the building of new ships and the retrofitting of current ships with eco-friendly technologies to increase their energy efficiency and lower harmful emissions.
The Bank also offered an average of €11 billion per year from 2012 to 2022 for sustainable transportation solutions and climate-friendly initiatives.
In 2022, railway projects received around 32% of overall transport loans, while urban mobility received approximately 37%.
Car travel increased steadily throughout the twentieth century, but trends since 2000 have been more complex.
Oil price rises from 2003 have been linked to a decline in per capita fuel use for private vehicle travel in the US, Britain and Australia.
In 2008, global oil consumption fell by 0.8% overall, with significant declines in consumption in North America, Western Europe, and parts of Asia.
Other factors affecting a decline in driving, at least in America, include the retirement of Baby Boomers who now drive less, preference for other travel modes (such as transit) by younger age cohorts, the Great Recession, and the rising use of technology (internet, mobile devices) which have made travel less necessary and possibly less attractive.
The term green transport is often used as a greenwash marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability.
Such claims can be legally challenged.
For instance the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman has targeted car manufacturers who claim that their cars are "green", "clean" or "environmentally friendly".
Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words.
The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) describes "green" claims on products as "very vague, inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim, which risks misleading them".
In 2008 the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its green marketing of Saab cars, which was found by the Australian Federal Court to be "misleading".
Several European countries are opening up financial incentives that support more sustainable modes of transport.
The European Cyclists' Federation, which focuses on daily cycling for transport, has created a document containing a non-complete overview.
In the UK, employers have for many years been providing employees with financial incentives.
The employee leases or borrows a bike that the employer has purchased.
You can also get other support.
The scheme is beneficial for the employee who saves money and gets an incentive to get exercise integrated in the daily routine.
The employer can expect a tax deduction, lower sick leave and less pressure on parking spaces for cars.
Since 2010, there has been a scheme in Iceland (Samgöngugreiðslur) where those who do not drive a car to work, get paid a lump of money monthly.
An employee must sign a statement not to use a car for work more often than one day a week, or 20% of the days for a period.
Some employers pay fixed amounts based on trust.
Other employers reimburse the expenses for repairs on bicycles, period-tickets for public transport and the like.
Since 2013, amounts up to ISK 8000 per month have been tax-free.
Most major workplaces offer this, and a significant proportion of employees use the scheme.
Since 2019 half the amount is tax-free if the employee signs a contract not to use a car to work for more than 40% of the days of the contract period.
Most of the tools and concepts of sustainable transport were developed before the phrase was coined.
Walking, the first mode of transport, is also the most sustainable.
Public transport dates back at least as far as the invention of the public bus by Blaise Pascal in 1662.
The first passenger tram began operation in 1807 and the first passenger rail service in 1825.
Pedal bicycles date from the 1860s.
These were the only personal transport choices available to most people in Western countries prior to World War II, and remain the only options for most people in the developing world.
Freight was moved by human power, animal power or rail.
The post-war years brought increased wealth and a demand for much greater mobility for people and goods.
The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between 1950 and 1979, with similar trends in other Western nations.
Most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better-designed roads and motorways, which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity.
Transport planning became a branch of Urban Planning and identified induced demand as a pivotal change from "predict and provide" toward a sustainable approach incorporating land use planning and public transit.
Public investment in transit, walking and cycling declined dramatically in the United States, Great Britain and Australia, although this did not occur to the same extent in Canada or mainland Europe.
Concerns about the sustainability of this approach became widespread during the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis.
The high cost and limited availability of fuel led to a resurgence of interest in alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel.
Transport innovations dating from this period include high-occupancy vehicle lanes, citywide carpool systems and transportation demand management.
Singapore implemented congestion pricing in the late 1970s, and Curitiba began implementing its Bus Rapid Transit system in the early 1980s.
Relatively low and stable oil prices during the 1980s and 1990s led to significant increases in vehicle travel from 1980 to 2000, both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances, and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing, distant from shops and from workplaces, now referred to as urban sprawl.
Trends in freight logistics, including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for just in time deliveries, meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic.
At the same time, the academic foundations of the "predict and provide" approach to transport were being questioned, notably by Peter Newman in a set of comparative studies of cities and their transport systems dating from the mid-1980s.
We recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face.
It would be environmentally irresponsible – and would not work.
A companion document to the White Paper called "Smarter Choices" researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across Britain, and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over 20%.
A similar study by the United States Federal Highway Administration, was also released in 2004 and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy.
An earlier use of the term was for part of the valve gear in beam engines beginning in 1715.
The term is also used for components in pneumatic cylinders and weaving loom.
This operation by tappets on a plug rod continued into the early twentieth century with the Cornish engine.
From the 19th century onwards, most steam engines used slide valves or piston valves, which do not require the use of tappets.
The principal types of tappets used in automotive engines are solid, hydraulic, and roller.
To reduce wear from the rotating camshaft, tappets are usually circular and allowed, or even encouraged, to rotate in place.
This minimizes wear caused by the camshaft contacting the same point on the base of the tappet each valve cycle, which can result in grooving.
However, in some relatively small engines with many cylinders (such as the Daimler '250' V8 engine), the tappets were small and non-rotating.
The base of most plain tappets is given a slight convex profile  to soften contact of the leading edge of the camshaft lobe.
An alternative to the tappet is the “finger follower”, which is a pivoting beam that is used to convert the camshaft rotation into opening and closing of a valve.
Finger followers are used in some high-performance dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) engines, most commonly in motorcycles and sports cars.
A locknut secures the set screw-in place.
Loose set screws can cause catastrophic engine failure, which has led to fatal aircraft crashes.
On some OHV engines in the 1960s, such as the Ford Taunus V4 engine and Opel CIH engine, the tappet adjustment was done by setting the height of the rocker pivot point (rather than the typical method of a rocker-end adjustment screw).
On the 1965-1970 versions of the Opel CIH engine with solid tappets, the tappet adjustment was conducted with the engine running.
A hydraulic tappet, also known as a "hydraulic valve lifter" and "hydraulic lash adjuster", contains a small hydraulic piston that becomes filled with pressurised engine oil.
The piston acts as a hydraulic spring that automatically adjusts the tappet clearance according to the oil pressure.
Although the movements of the piston are small and infrequent, they are sufficient to make the valve actuation self-adjusting so that there is no need to manually adjust the clearance of the tappets.
Hydraulic tappets depend on a supply of clean oil at the appropriate pressure.
When starting a cold engine, with low oil pressure, hydraulic tappets are often noisy for a few seconds, until they position themselves correctly.
Early automotive engines used a roller at the contact point with the camshaft,: 44  however as engine speeds increased, 'flat tappets' with plain ends became far more common than tappets with rollers.
However in recent times, roller tappets and rocker arms with roller tappet ends have made a resurgence due to the lower friction providing greater efficiency and reducing drag.
In a sidevalve engine— a common design for car engines until the 1950s— the valves are mounted at the sides of the cylinder and face upwards.
This means that the camshaft could be placed directly beneath the valves, without the need for a rocker.
With lower cylinder blocks, the tappets could drive the valves directly without needing even a push rod.
Sidevalve engines also required regular adjustment of the tappet clearance, and in this case it was the tappets themselves that were adjusted directly.
Small access plates were provided on the sides of the cylinder block, giving access to the gap between the valves and tappets.
Some tappets had a threaded adjuster, but simpler engines could be adjusted by grinding down the ends of the valve stem directly.
As the tappet adjustment always consisted of expanding the clearance (re-grinding valves into their valve seats during de-coking makes them sit lower, thus reducing the tappet clearance), adjustment by shortening the valve stems was a viable method.
Eventually the valves would be replaced entirely, a relatively common operation for engines of this era.
In a pushrod engine, the tappets are located down in the engine block and operate long, thin pushrods which transfer the motion (via the rocker arms) to the valves located at the top of the engine.
In a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) engine, the tappets are integrated into the design of the rocker arms as one piece, since the camshaft interacts with the rocker arm directly.
Mass-production of SOHC engines for passenger cars became more common in the 1970s, in the form of crossflow cylinder heads with overhead rockers located directly above a single overhead camshaft, as a more efficient design which could be cost-effectively manufactured.
The 1970-2001 Ford Pinto engine was one of the first mass-production engines to use an SOHC design with a toothed cambelt.
In this configuration, the rockers combine the function of sliding tappet, rocker and adjustment device.
Adjustment of the valve clearance was usually by a threaded stud at the valve end of the rocker.
The linear sliding tappet side often had a high rate of wear and demanded careful lubrication with oil containing zinc additives.
A relatively uncommon design of an SOHC camshaft with four valves per cylinder was first used in the 1973-1980 Triumph Dolomite Sprint inline-four engine, which used a camshaft with 8 lobes that actuated the 16 valves via a clever arrangement of rocker arms.
Double overhead camshaft (DOHC) engines were first developed as high performance aircraft and racing engines, with the camshafts mounted directly over the valves and driving them through a simple 'bucket tappet'.
Most engines used a crossflow cylinder head with the valves in two rows in line with their corresponding camshaft.
The tappet clearance adjustment is typically set using a small shim, located either above or below the tappet.
Shims were made in a range of standard thicknesses and a mechanic would swap them to change the tappet gap.
In early DOHC engines, the engine would first be assembled with a default shim of known thickness, then the gap measured.
This measurement would be used to calculate the thickness of shim that would result in the desired gap.
After installation of the new shim, the gaps would then be measured again to verify that the clearance was correct.
As the camshaft had to be removed to change the shims, this was a very time consuming operation (especially since the position of the camshaft could vary slightly each time it was re-installed).
Later engines used an improved design where the shims were located above the tappets, which allowed each shim to be changed without removing either the tappet or camshaft.
A drawback of this design is that the rubbing surface of the tappet becomes the surface of the shim, which is a difficult problem of mass-production metallurgy.
The first mass production engine to use this system was the 1966-2000 Fiat Twin Cam engine, followed by engines from Volvo and the water-cooled Volkswagens.
The term 'tappet' is also used, obscurely, as a component of valve systems for other machinery, particularly as part of a bash valve in pneumatic cylinders.
Where a reciprocating action is produced, such as for a pneumatic drill or jackhammer, the valve may be actuated by inertia or by the movement of the working piston.
As the piston hammers back and forth, it impacts a small tappet, which in turn moves the air valve and so reverses the flow of air to the piston.
which the weft threads (side to side or short direction) are passed.
The tappets form the basic patterns in the material such as plain weave, twill, denim, or satin weaves.
Harris tweed is still woven on looms in which tappets are still used.
A tachometer (revolution-counter, tach, rev-counter, RPM gauge) is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a shaft or disk, as in a motor or other machine.
The device usually displays the revolutions per minute (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, but digital displays are increasingly common.
The word comes from Greek τάχος (táchos "speed") and μέτρον (métron "measure").
Essentially the words tachometer and speedometer have identical meaning: a device that measures speed.
It is by arbitrary convention that in the automotive world one is used for engine revolutions and the other for vehicle speed.
In formal engineering nomenclature, more precise terms are used to distinguish the two.
The first tachometer was described by Bryan Donkin in a paper to the Royal Society of Arts in 1810 for which he was awarded the Gold medal of the society.
This consisted of a bowl of mercury constructed in such a way that centrifugal force caused the level in a central tube to fall when it rotated and brought down the level in a narrower tube above filled with coloured spirit.
The bowl was connected to the machinery to be measured by pulleys.
The first mechanical tachometers were based on measuring the centrifugal force, similar to the operation of a centrifugal governor.
The inventor is assumed to be the German engineer Dietrich Uhlhorn; he used it for measuring the speed of machines in 1817.
Since 1840, it has been used to measure the speed of locomotives.
Tachometers or revolution counters on cars, aircraft, and other vehicles show the rate of rotation of the engine's crankshaft, and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds.
This can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions.
Prolonged use at high speeds may cause inadequate lubrication, overheating (exceeding capability of the cooling system), exceeding speed capability of sub-parts of the engine (for example spring retracted valves) thus causing excessive wear or permanent damage or failure of engines.
On analogue tachometers, speeds above maximum safe operating speed are typically indicated by an area of the gauge marked in red, giving rise to the expression of "redlining" an engine — revving the engine up to the maximum safe limit.
Most modern cars typically have a revolution limiter which electronically limits engine speed to prevent damage.
Diesel engines with traditional mechanical injector systems have an integral governor which prevents over-speeding the engine, so the tachometers in vehicles and machinery fitted with such engines sometimes lack a redline.
In vehicles such as tractors and trucks, the tachometer often has other markings, usually a green arc showing the speed range in which the engine produces maximum torque, which is of prime interest to operators of such vehicles.
Tractors fitted with a power take-off (PTO) system have tachometers showing the engine speed needed to rotate the PTO at the standardized speed required by most PTO-driven implements.
In many countries, tractors are required to have a speedometer for use on a road.
To save fitting a second dial, the vehicle's tachometer is often marked with a second scale in units of speed.
This scale is only accurate in a certain gear, but since many tractors only have one gear that is practical for use on-road, this is sufficient.
Tractors with multiple 'road gears' often have tachometers with more than one speed scale.
Aircraft tachometers have a green arc showing the engine's designed cruising speed range.
In older vehicles, the tachometer is driven by the RMS voltage waves from the low tension (LT contact breaker) side of the ignition coil, while on others (and nearly all diesel engines, which have no ignition system) engine speed is determined by the frequency from the alternator tachometer output.
This is from a special connection called an "AC tap" which is a connection to one of the stator's coil output, before the rectifier.
Tachometers driven by a rotating cable from a drive unit fitted to the engine (usually on the camshaft) exist - usually on simple diesel-engined machinery with basic or no electrical systems.
On recent EMS found on modern vehicles, the signal for the tachometer is usually generated from an ECU which derives the information from  either the crankshaft or camshaft speed sensor.
Tachometers are used to estimate traffic speed and volume (flow).
A vehicle is equipped with the sensor and conducts "tach runs" which record the traffic data.
These data are a substitute or complement to loop detector data.
To get statistically significant results requires a high number of runs, and bias is introduced by the time of day, day of week, and the season.
However, because of the expense, spacing (a lower density of loop detectors diminishes data accuracy), and relatively low reliability of loop detectors (often 30% or more are out of service at any given time), tach runs remain a common practice.
Speed sensing devices, termed variously "wheel impulse generators" (WIG), pulse generators, speed probes, or tachometers are used extensively in rail vehicles.
Common types include opto-isolator slotted disk sensors and Hall effect sensors.
Hall effect sensors typically use a rotating target attached to a wheel, gearbox or motor.
This target may contain magnets, or it may be a toothed wheel.
The teeth on the wheel vary the flux density of a magnet inside the sensor head.
The probe is mounted with its head a precise distance from the target wheel and detects the teeth or magnets passing its face.
One problem with this system is that the necessary air gap between the target wheel and the sensor allows ferrous dust from the vehicle's underframe to build up on the probe or target, inhibiting its function.
Opto-isolator sensors are completely encased to prevent ingress from the outside environment.
The only exposed parts are a sealed plug connector and a drive fork, which is attached to a slotted disk internally through a bearing and seal.
The slotted disk is typically sandwiched between two circuit boards containing a photo-diode, photo-transistor, amplifier, and filtering circuits which produce a square wave pulse train output customized to the customers voltage and pulses per revolution requirements.
These types of sensors typically provide 2 to 8 independent channels of output that can be sampled by other systems in the vehicle such as automatic train control systems and propulsion/braking controllers.
The sensors mounted around the circumference of the disk provide quadrature encoded outputs and thus allow the vehicle's computer to determine the direction of rotation of the wheel.
This is a legal requirement in Switzerland to prevent rollback when starting from standstill.
Strictly, such devices are not tachometers since they do not provide a direct reading of the rotational speed of the disk.
The speed has to be derived externally by counting the number of pulses in a time period.
It is difficult to prove conclusively that the vehicle is stationary, other than by waiting a certain time to ensure that no further pulses occur.
This is one reason why there is often a time delay between the train stopping, as perceived by a passenger, and the doors being released.
Slotted-disk devices are typical sensors used in odometer systems for rail vehicles, such as are required for train protection systems — notably the European Train Control System.
As well as speed sensing, these probes are often used to calculate distance travelled by multiplying wheel rotations by wheel circumference.
They can be used to automatically calibrate wheel diameter by comparing the number of rotations of each axle against a master wheel that has been measured manually.
Since all wheels travel the same distance, the diameter of each wheel is proportional to its number of rotations compared to the master wheel.
This calibration must be done while coasting at a fixed speed to eliminate the possibility of wheel slip/slide introducing errors into the calculation.
Automatic calibration of this type is used to generate more accurate traction and braking signals, and to improve wheel slip detection.
A weakness of systems that rely on wheel rotation for tachometry and odometry is that the train wheels and the rails are very smooth and the friction between them is low, leading to high error rates if the wheels slip or slide.
To compensate for this, secondary odometry inputs employ Doppler radar units beneath the train to measure speed independently.
In analogue audio recording, a tachometer is a device that measures the speed of audiotape as it passes across the head.
On most audio tape recorders the tachometer (or simply "tach") is a relatively large spindle near the ERP head stack, isolated from the feed and take-up spindles by tension idlers.
On many recorders the tachometer spindle is connected by an axle to a rotating magnet that induces a changing magnetic field upon a Hall effect transistor.
Other systems connect the spindle to a stroboscope, which alternates light and dark upon a photodiode.
Having perfectly regulated tape speed is important because the human ear is very sensitive to changes in pitch, particularly sudden ones, and without a self-regulating system to control the speed of tape across the head, the pitch could drift several percent.
This effect is called a wow-and-flutter, and a modern, tachometer-regulated cassette deck has a wow-and-flutter of 0.07%.
Tachometers are acceptable for high-fidelity sound playback, but not for recording in synchronization with a movie camera.
For such purposes, special recorders that record pilottone must be used.
Tachometer signals can be used to synchronize several tape machines together, but only if in addition to the tach signal, a directional signal is transmitted, to tell slave machines in which direction the master is moving.
Targa top, or targa for short, is a semi-convertible car body style with a removable roof section and a full-width roll bar behind the seats.
The term was first used on the 1966 Porsche 911 Targa, and it remains a registered trademark of Porsche AG.
The rear window is normally fixed, but on some targa models, it is a removable plastic foldable window, making it a convertible-type vehicle.
Any piece of normally fixed metal or trim which rises up from one side, over the roof and down the other side is sometimes called a targa band, targa bar, or wrapover band.
Targa tops are different from T-tops, which have a solid, non-removable bar running between the top of the windscreen and the rear roll-bar, and generally have two separate roof panels above the seats that fit between the window and central t-bar.
The word targa first came into use from the 1965 Porsche 911 Targa, though it was not the first to use the removable roof panel system.
The system first appeared in 1957 on the limited-production Fiat 1200 "Wonderful" by Vignale, designed by Giovanni Michelotti.
The later Triumph TR4 from 1961, another Michelotti design, also featured a similar system, defined by Triumph as a surrey top.
The 1964 SAAB Catherina prototype and the 1965 Toyota Sports 800 both used similar systems before the 1967 Porsche 911 Targa.
The targa style roof opening became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, when there were fears that the Department of Transportation (DOT) in the United States would ban convertibles, due to concerns over the safety of occupants when a car overturns.
As a result, manufacturers adopted Targa tops or T-tops.
As Porsche helped to popularise this body style, they took out a trademark for the Targa name and manufacturers sought for alternative names for their removable tops.
Porsche got the name "Targa" from the Targa Florio, the road race in Sicily where Porsche was very successful.
Targa means "plate" (or placard) in Italian.
Targa and T-top numbers have slowly declined as manufacturers discontinued them in favour of full convertibles with retractable hardtops and folding metal roofs such as the Mercedes-Benz SLK, and by better structural engineering with pop-up roll-over bars behind the seats and front roll-over bars incorporated into the front windscreen.
The year 1996 saw the debut of a retractable glass roof in the Porsche 993 Targa, a design continued on the 996 and 997 Targa.
The glass roof retracted underneath the rear window revealing a large opening.
A shade was there to help prevent the greenhouse effect of the closed roof.
This system was a complete redesign, as previous Targa models had a removable roof section and a wide B-pillar functioning as a roll bar.
The new glass roof design allowed the 993 Targa to retain nearly the same side-on profile as the other 911 Carrera variants and eliminated the inconvenience of storing the removed top of the old system.
The Targa had the body of the Cabriolet with the Targa glass roof replacing the fabric roof.
The 911 Targa continued with the all-new 996-model and gained a lifting hatchback glass window.
This, in turn, was used on the later 997 model of 911.
With the introduction and production of the latest two generations of 911, the Type 991 and 992, Porsche decided to take the Targa in a different direction from that of the previous water-cooled Type 996/997 cars.
The latest Targas were introduced in 2013 and 2019, and unlike the Type 993/996/997 Targas, the newer cars have somewhat returned to their earliest Targa roots by utilizing a solid roof panel spanning over the front seats.
However unlike the manual lift-out panels of earlier 911s, the Type 991 and 992 Targa's roof panels are mechanized for automated lift-away and storage under the rear glass roof, which itself is mechanized to lift up and out of the way as the roof panel is placed into its stowed position.
The Type 991 Targa also brought back the styling feature of the 'Targa bar' that was perhaps the most obvious and overt design cue of the air-cooled generation Targas.
But unlike the previous Targa hoops, the one used on the Type 991 is in sections, where the horizontal span member is a physically separate piece that itself is mechanized to lift off of its vertical supports in order to allow the solid roof panel and its motorized components to slide rearwards as the panel is being stored within the car.
Ferrari introduced a hybrid variation of the targa roof and folding metal roof with the 180 degree rotating roof featured on the 2005 Ferrari Superamerica designed by Leonardo Fioravanti, which was previewed on his Alfa Romeo Vola concept in 2000.
The concept was also used in the 2010 Renault Wind.
Suspension is the system of tires, tire air, springs, shock absorbers and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allows relative motion between the two.
Suspension systems must support both road holding/handling and ride quality, which are at odds with each other.
The tuning of suspensions involves finding the right compromise.
It is important for the suspension to keep the road wheel in contact with the road surface as much as possible, because all the road or ground forces acting on the vehicle do so through the contact patches of the tires.
The suspension also protects the vehicle itself and any cargo or luggage from damage and wear.
The design of front and rear suspension of a car may be different.
An early form of suspension on ox-drawn carts had the platform swing on iron chains attached to the wheeled frame of the carriage.
This system remained the basis for most suspension systems until the turn of the 19th century, although the iron chains were replaced with the use of leather straps called thoroughbraces by the 17th century.
No modern automobiles have used the thoroughbrace suspension system.
By approximately 1750, leaf springs began appearing on certain types of carriage, such as the Landau.
By the middle of the 19th century, elliptical springs might additionally start to be used on carriages.
Automobiles were initially developed as self-propelled versions of horse-drawn vehicles.
However, horse-drawn vehicles had been designed for relatively slow speeds, and their suspension was not well suited to the higher speeds permitted by the internal combustion engine.
The first workable spring-suspension required advanced metallurgical knowledge and skill, and only became possible with the advent of industrialisation.
Obadiah Elliott registered the first patent for a spring-suspension vehicle; each wheel had two durable steel leaf springs on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the springs which were attached to the axles.
Within a decade, most British horse carriages were equipped with springs; wooden springs in the case of light one-horse vehicles to avoid taxation, and steel springs in larger vehicles.
These were often made of low-carbon steel and usually took the form of multiple layer leaf springs.
Leaf springs have been around since the early Egyptians.
Ancient military engineers used leaf springs in the form of bows to power their siege engines, with little success at first.
The use of leaf springs in catapults was later refined and made to work years later.
Springs were not only made of metal; a sturdy tree branch could be used as a spring, such as with a bow.
Horse-drawn carriages and Ford Model T used this system, and it is still used today in larger vehicles, mainly mounted in the rear suspension.
Leaf springs were the first modern suspension system, and, along with advances in the construction of roads, heralded the single greatest improvement in road transport until the advent of the automobile.
The British steel springs were not well-suited for use on America's rough roads of the time, so the Abbot-Downing Company of Concord, New Hampshire re-introduced leather strap suspension, which gave a swinging motion instead of the jolting up-and-down of spring suspension.
In 1901, Mors of Paris first fitted an automobile with shock absorbers.
With the advantage of a damped suspension system on his 'Mors Machine', Henri Fournier won the prestigious Paris-to-Berlin race on 20 June 1901.
Fournier's superior time was 11 hrs 46 min 10 sec, while the best competitor was Léonce Girardot in a Panhard with a time of 12 hours, 15 minutes, and 40 seconds.
Coil springs first appeared on a production vehicle in 1906 in the Brush Runabout made by the Brush Motor Company.
Today, coil springs are used in most cars.
In 1920, Leyland Motors used torsion bars in a suspension system.
In 1922, independent front suspension was pioneered on Lancia Lambda, and became more common in mass market cars from 1932.
Today, most cars have independent suspension on all four wheels.
The part on which pre-1950 springs were supported is called a dumb iron.
In 2002, a new passive suspension component, the inerter, was invented by Malcolm C. Smith.
This has the ability to increase the effective inertia of wheel suspension using a geared flywheel, but without adding significant mass.
It was initially employed in Formula One in secrecy, but has since spread to wider motorsport.
For front-wheel drive cars, rear suspension has few constraints, and a variety of beam axles and independent suspensions are used.
For rear-wheel drive cars, rear suspension has many constraints, and the development of the superior, but more expensive independent suspension layout has been difficult.
Henry Ford's Model T used a torque tube to restrain this force, for his differential was attached to the chassis by a lateral leaf spring and two narrow rods.
The torque tube surrounded the true driveshaft and exerted the force to its ball joint at the extreme rear of the transmission, which was attached to the engine.
A similar method like this was used in the late 1930s by Buick and by Hudson's bathtub car in 1948, which used helical springs that could not take fore-and-aft thrust.
The Hotchkiss drive, invented by Albert Hotchkiss, was the most popular rear suspension system used in American cars from the 1930s to the 1970s.
The system uses longitudinal leaf springs attached both forward and behind the differential of the live axle.
These springs transmit torque to the frame.
Although scorned by many European car makers of the time, it was accepted by American car makers, because it was inexpensive to manufacture.
Also, the dynamic defects of this design were suppressed by the enormous weight of U.S. passenger vehicles before the implementation of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard.
Another Frenchman invented the De Dion tube, which is sometimes called "semi-independent".
Like true independent rear suspension, this employs two universal joints, or their equivalent from the centre of the differential to each wheel.
But the wheels cannot entirely rise and fall independently of each other; they are tied by a yoke that goes around the differential, below and behind it.
This method has had little use in the United States.
Its use around 1900 was probably due to the poor quality of tires, which wore out quickly.
By removing a good deal of unsprung weight, as independent rear suspensions do, it made them last longer.
Rear-wheel drive vehicles today frequently use a fairly complex fully-independent, multi-link suspension to locate the rear wheels securely, while providing decent ride quality.
The spring rate (or suspension rate) is a component in setting the vehicle's ride height or its location in the suspension stroke.
When a spring is compressed or stretched, the force it exerts, is proportional to its change in length.
The spring rate or spring constant of a spring is the change in the force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring.
Vehicles that carry heavy loads, will often have heavier springs to compensate for the additional weight that would otherwise collapse a vehicle to the bottom of its travel (stroke).
Heavier springs are also used in performance applications, where the loading conditions experienced are more significant.
Springs that are too hard or too soft cause the suspension to become ineffective – mostly because they fail to properly isolate the vehicle from the road.
Vehicles that commonly experience suspension loads heavier than normal, have heavy or hard springs, with a spring rate close to the upper limit for that vehicle's weight.
This allows the vehicle to perform properly under a heavy load, when control is limited by the inertia of the load.
Riding in an empty truck meant for carrying loads can be uncomfortable for passengers, because of its high spring rate relative to the weight of the vehicle.
A race car could also be described as having heavy springs, and would also be uncomfortably bumpy.
However, even though we say they both have heavy springs, the actual spring rates for a 2,000 lb (910 kg) racecar and a 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) truck are very different.
A luxury car, taxi, or passenger bus would be described as having soft springs, for the comfort of their passengers or driver.
Vehicles with worn-out or damaged springs ride lower to the ground, which reduces the overall amount of compression available to the suspension, and increases the amount of body lean.
Performance vehicles can sometimes have spring rate requirements other than vehicle weight and load.
Wheel rate is the effective spring rate when measured at the wheel, as opposed to simply measuring the spring rate alone.
Wheel rate is usually equal to or considerably less than the spring rate.
Commonly, springs are mounted on control arms, swing arms or some other pivoting suspension member.
Consider the example above, where the spring rate was calculated to be 500 lbs/inch (87.5 N/mm), if one were to move the wheel 1 in (2.5 cm) (without moving the car), the spring more than likely compresses a smaller amount.
If the spring moved 0.75 in (19 mm), the lever arm ratio would be 0.75:1.
The wheel rate is calculated by taking the square of the ratio (0.5625) times the spring rate, thus obtaining 281.25 lbs/inch (49.25 N/mm).
The ratio is squared because it has two effects on the wheel rate: it applies to both the force and the distance traveled.
Wheel rate on independent suspension is fairly straightforward.
However, special consideration must be taken with some non-independent suspension designs.
Take the case of the straight axle.
When viewed from the front or rear, the wheel rate can be measured by the means above.
Yet, because the wheels are not independent, when viewed from the side under acceleration or braking, the pivot point is at infinity (because both wheels have moved) and the spring is directly inline with the wheel contact patch.
The result is often, that the effective wheel rate under cornering is different from what it is under acceleration and braking.
This variation in wheel rate may be minimised by locating the spring as close to the wheel as possible.
Wheel rates are usually summed and compared with the sprung mass of a vehicle to create a "ride rate" and the corresponding suspension natural frequency in  ride (also referred to as "heave").
This can be useful in creating a metric for suspension stiffness and travel requirements for a vehicle.
Roll rate is analogous to a vehicle's ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing a vehicle's sprung mass to roll.
It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the vehicle sprung mass.
It is influenced by factors including but not limited to vehicle sprung mass, track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll centre heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction.
The roll rate of a vehicle can, and usually, does differ front-to-rear, which allows for the tuning ability of a vehicle for transient and steady-state handling.
The roll rate of a vehicle does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis.
Generally, the higher the roll rate on an axle of a vehicle, the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.
By 2021, some vehicles were offering dynamic roll control with ride-height adjustable air suspension and adaptive dampers.
Roll couple percentage is a simplified method of describing lateral load transfer distribution front to rear, and subsequently handling balance.
It is the effective wheel rate, in roll, of each axle of the vehicle as a ratio of the vehicle's total roll rate.
It is commonly adjusted through the use of anti-roll bars, but can also be changed through the use of different springs.
Weight transfer during cornering, acceleration, or braking is usually calculated per individual wheel, and compared with the static weights for the same wheels.
The total amount of weight transfer is only affected by four factors: the distance between wheel centers (wheelbase in the case of braking, or track width in the case of cornering), the height of the center of gravity, the mass of the vehicle, and the amount of acceleration experienced.
The speed at which weight transfer occurs, as well as through which components it transfers, is complex, and is determined by many factors; including, but not limited to: roll center height, spring and damper rates, anti-roll bar stiffness, and the kinematic design of suspension links.
In most conventional applications, when weight is transferred through intentionally compliant elements, such as springs, dampers, and anti-roll bars, the weight transfer is said to be "elastic", while the weight which is transferred through more rigid suspension links, such as A-arms and toe links, is said to be "geometric".
Unsprung weight transfer is calculated based on weight of the vehicle's components that are not supported by the springs.
This includes tires, wheels, brakes, spindles, half the control arm's weight, and other components.
These components are then (for calculation purposes) assumed to be connected to a vehicle with zero sprung weight.
They are then put through the same dynamic loads.
The weight transfer for cornering in the front would be equal to the total unsprung front weight times the G-force times the front unsprung center of gravity height divided by the front track width.
The same is true for the rear.
Sprung weight transfer is the weight transferred by only the weight of the vehicle resting on its springs, and not by total vehicle weight.
Calculating this requires knowing the vehicle's sprung weight (total weight less the unsprung weight), the front and rear roll center heights, and the sprung center of gravity height (used to calculate the roll moment arm length).
Calculating the front and rear sprung weight transfer will also require knowing the roll couple percentage.
The roll axis is the line through the front and rear roll centers that the vehicle rolls around during cornering.
The distance from this axis to the sprung center of gravity height is the roll moment arm length.
The total sprung weight transfer is equal to the G-force times the sprung weight times the roll moment arm length divided by the effective track width.
The front sprung weight transfer is calculated by multiplying the roll couple percentage times the total sprung weight transfer.
The rear is the total minus the front transfer.
Jacking forces are the sum of the vertical force components experienced by suspension links.
The resultant force acts to lift the sprung mass, if the roll center is above ground, or compress it, if underground.
Generally, the higher the roll center, the more jacking force is experienced.
Many off-road vehicles, such as desert racers, use straps called "limiting straps" to limit the suspensions' downward travel to a point within safe limits for the linkages and shock absorbers.
This is necessary, since these trucks are intended to travel over very rough terrain at high speeds, and even become airborne at times.
Without something to limit the travel, the suspension bushings would take all the force, when suspension reaches "full droop", and it can even cause the coil springs to come out of their "buckets", if they are held in by compression forces only.
A limiting strap is a simple strap, often from nylon of a predetermined length, that stops downward movement at a pre-set point before theoretical maximum travel is reached.
The opposite of this is the "bump-stop", which protects the suspension and the vehicle (as well as the occupants) from the violent "bottoming" of the suspension, caused when an obstruction (or a hard landing) causes suspension to run out of upward travel without fully absorbing the energy of the stroke.
Without bump-stops, a vehicle that "bottoms out", will experience a very hard shock when the suspension contacts the bottom of the frame or body, which is transferred to the occupants and every connector and weld on the vehicle.
Factory vehicles often come with plain rubber "nubs" to absorb the worst of the forces, and insulate the shock.
A desert race vehicle, which must routinely absorb far higher impact forces, might be provided with pneumatic or hydro-pneumatic bump-stops.
These are essentially miniature shock absorbers (dampers) that are fixed to the vehicle in a location, such, that the suspension will contact the end of the piston when it nears the upward travel limit.
These absorb the impact far more effectively than a solid rubber bump-stop will, essential, because a rubber bump-stop is considered a "last-ditch" emergency insulator for the occasional accidental bottoming of the suspension; it is entirely insufficient to absorb repeated and heavy bottoming, such as a high-speed off-road vehicle encounters.
Damping is the control of motion or oscillation, as seen with the use of hydraulic gates and valves in a vehicle's shock absorber.
This may also vary, intentionally or unintentionally.
Like spring rate, the optimal damping for comfort may be less, than for control.
Damping controls the travel speed and resistance of the vehicle's suspension.
An undamped car will oscillate up and down.
With proper damping levels, the car will settle back to a normal state in a minimal amount of time.
Most damping in modern vehicles can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the resistance to fluid flow in the shock absorber.
See dependent and independent below.
Camber changes due to wheel travel, body roll and suspension system deflection or compliance.
In general, a tire wears and brakes best at -1 to -2° of camber from vertical.
Depending on the tire and the road surface, it may hold the road best at a slightly different angle.
Small changes in camber, front and rear, can be used to tune handling.
Some racecars are tuned with -2 to -7° camber, depending on the type of handling desired, and tire construction.
Often, too much camber will result in the decrease of braking performance due to a reduced contact patch size through excessive camber variation in suspension geometry.
The amount of camber change in bump is determined by the instantaneous front view swing arm (FVSA) length of suspension geometry, or in other words, the tendency of the tire to camber inward when compressed in bump.
Roll center height is a product of suspension instant center heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear roll stiffness distribution.
Conventionally, roll stiffness distribution is tuned adjusting antiroll bars rather than roll center height (as both tend to have a similar effect on the sprung mass), but the height of the roll center is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.
Due to the fact that the wheel and tire's motion is constrained by the vehicle's suspension links, the motion of the wheel package in the front view will scribe an imaginary arc in space with an "instantaneous center" of rotation at any given point along its path.
The instant center for any wheel package can be found by following imaginary lines drawn through suspension links to their intersection point.
A component of the tire's force vector points from the contact patch of the tire through instant center.
The larger this component is, the less suspension motion will occur.
Theoretically, if the resultant of the vertical load on the tire and the lateral force generated by it points directly into the instant center, the suspension links will not move.
In this case, all weight transfer at that end of the vehicle will be geometric in nature.
This is key information used in finding the force-based roll center as well.
In this respect, the instant centers are more important to the handling of the vehicle, than the kinematic roll center alone, in that the ratio of geometric-to-elastic weight transfer is determined by the forces at the tires and their directions in relation to the position of their respective instant centers.
Anti-dive and anti-squat are percentages that indicate the degree to which the front dives under braking, and the rear squats under acceleration.
They can be thought of as the counterparts for braking and acceleration, as jacking forces are to cornering.
The main reason for the difference is due to the different design goals between front and rear suspension, whereas suspension is usually symmetrical between the left and the right of the vehicle.
The method of determining anti-dive or anti-squat depends on whether suspension linkages react to the torque of braking and accelerating.
For example, with inboard brakes and half-shaft-driven rear wheels, the suspension linkages do not react, but with outboard brakes and a swing-axle driveline, they do.
To determine the percentage of front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, it is first necessary to determine the tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal.
In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known.
Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase.
A value of 50% would mean, that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels; during braking, it is being transmitted through front suspension linkage, and half is being transmitted through front suspension springs.
For inboard brakes, the same procedure is followed, but using the wheel center instead of contact patch center.
Forward acceleration anti-squat is calculated in a similar manner and with the same relationship between percentage and weight transfer.
Anti-squat values of 100% and more are commonly used in drag racing, but values of 50% or less are more common in cars that have to undergo severe braking.
Higher values of anti-squat commonly cause wheel hop during braking.
It is important to note, that the value of 100% means, that all of the weight transfer is being carried through suspension linkage.
However, this does not mean that the suspension is incapable of carrying additional loads (aerodynamic, cornering, etc.)
during an episode of braking, or forward acceleration.
In other words, no "binding" of the suspension is to be implied.
In some modern cars, flexibility is mainly in rubber bushings, which are subject to decay over time.
For high-stress suspensions, such as off-road vehicles, polyurethane bushings are available, which offer more longevity under greater stresses.
However, due to weight and cost considerations, structures are not made more rigid than necessary.
Some vehicles exhibit detrimental vibrations involving the flexing of structural parts, such as when accelerating while turning sharply.  Flexibility of structures, such as frames and suspension links, can also contribute to springing, especially to damping out high-frequency vibrations.
The flexibility of wire wheels contributed to their popularity in times when cars had less advanced suspensions.
Automobiles can be heavily laden with luggage, passengers, and trailers.
This loading will cause a vehicle's tail to sink downwards.
Maintaining a steady chassis level is essential to achieving the proper handling that the vehicle was designed for.
Oncoming drivers can be blinded by the headlight beam.
Self-levelling suspension counteracts this by inflating cylinders in the suspension to lift the chassis higher.
These are usually small, except that the suspension is related to whether the brakes and differential(s) are sprung.
This is the main functional advantage of aluminum wheels over steel wheels.
Aluminum suspension parts have been used in production cars, and carbon fiber suspension parts are common in racing cars.
Designs differ as to how much space they take up, and where it is located.
It is generally accepted, that MacPherson struts are the most compact arrangement for front-engined vehicles, where space between the wheels is required to place the engine.
Inboard brakes (which reduce unsprung weight) are probably avoided more due to space considerations than to cost.
The suspension attachment must match the frame design in geometry, strength and rigidity.
Certain modern vehicles have height adjustable suspension in order to improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency.
Modern formula cars that have exposed wheels and suspension typically use streamlined tubing rather than simple round tubing for their suspension arms to reduce aerodynamic drag.
Also typical is the use of rocker-arm, push rod, or pull rod-type suspensions, that, among other things, place the spring/damper unit inboard and out of the air stream to further reduce air resistance.
Production methods improve, but cost is always a factor.
The continued use of the solid rear axle, with unsprung differential, especially on heavy vehicles, seems to be the most obvious example.
Most conventional suspensions use passive springs to absorb impacts and dampers (or shock absorbers) to control spring motions.
Traditional springs and dampers are referred to as passive suspensions — most vehicles are suspended in this manner.
Shock absorbers damp out the (otherwise simple harmonic) motions of a vehicle up and down on its springs.
They must also damp out much of the wheel bounce when the unsprung weight of a wheel, hub, axle, and sometimes brakes and the differential bounces up and down on the springiness of a tire.
If suspension is externally controlled, then it is a semi-active or active suspension — the suspension is reacting to signals from an electronic controller.
For example, a hydropneumatic Citroën will "know" how far off the ground the car is supposed to be, and constantly resets to achieve that level, regardless of load.
However, this type of suspension will not instantly compensate for body roll due to cornering.
Citroën's system adds about 1% to the cost of the car versus passive steel springs.
Semi-active suspensions include devices, such as air springs and switchable shock absorbers, various self-levelling solutions, as well as systems, like hydropneumatic, hydrolastic, and hydragas suspensions.
Toyota introduced switchable shock absorbers in the 1983 Soarer.
Delphi currently sells shock absorbers filled with a magneto-rheological fluid, whose viscosity can be changed electromagnetically — thereby giving variable control without switching valves, which is faster and thus more effective.
Fully active suspension systems use electronic monitoring of vehicle conditions, coupled with the means to change the behavior of vehicle suspension in real time to directly control the motion of the car.
Lotus Cars developed several prototypes from 1982 onwards, and introduced them to Formula One, where they have been fairly effective, but have now been banned.
Nissan introduced low-bandwidth active suspension circa 1990 as an option that added an extra 20% to the price of luxury models.
Citroën has also developed several active suspension models (see hydractive).
A fully active system from Bose Corporation, announced in 2009, uses linear electric motors in place of hydraulic or pneumatic actuators that have generally been used up until recently.
Mercedes introduced an active suspension system called Active Body Control in its top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz CL-Class in 1999.
Several electromagnetic suspensions have also been developed for vehicles.
Examples include the electromagnetic suspension of Bose, and the electromagnetic suspension developed by prof.
Laurentiu Encica.
In addition, the new Michelin wheel with embedded suspension functioning on an electric motor is also similar.
With the help of a control system, various semi-active/active suspensions realize an improved design compromise among different vibration modes of the vehicle; namely: bounce, roll, pitch and warp modes.
However, the applications of these advanced suspensions are constrained by cost, packaging, weight, reliability, and/or other challenges.
Interconnected suspension, unlike semi-active/active suspensions, could easily decouple different vehicle vibration modes in a passive manner.
Interconnections can be realized by various means, such as mechanical, hydraulic, and pneumatic.
Anti-roll bars are one of the typical examples of mechanical interconnections, while it has been stated, that fluidic interconnections offer greater potential and flexibility in improving both the stiffness and damping properties.
Considering the considerable commercial potentials of hydro-pneumatic technology (Corolla, 1996), interconnected hydropneumatic suspensions have also been explored in some recent studies, and their potential benefits in enhancing vehicle ride and handling have been demonstrated.
The control system can also be used for further improving performance of interconnected suspensions.
Apart from academic research, an Australian company Kinetic had some success with various passive or semi-active systems (WRC: three Championships; the Dakar Rally: two Championships; Lexus GX470 2004 as the 4×4 of the year with KDSS; the 2005 PACE award).
These systems by Kinetic generally decouple at least two vehicle modes (roll, warp (articulation), pitch, and/or heave (bounce)) to simultaneously control each mode's stiffness and damping by using interconnected shock absorbers, and other methods.
In 1999, Kinetic was bought out by Tenneco.
Later developments by the Catalan company Creuat have devised a simpler system design based on single-acting cylinders.
After some projects on competition, Creuat is active in providing retrofit systems for some vehicle models.
Historically, the first mass-production car with front-to-rear mechanical interconnected suspension was the 1948 Citroën 2CV.
Suspension in the 2CV was extremely soft — the longitudinal link was making pitch softer, instead of making roll stiffer.
It relied on extreme anti-dive and anti-squat geometries to compensate for that.
This resulted in a softer axle-crossing stiffness that anti-roll bars would have otherwise compromised.
The leading arm / trailing arm swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system, together with in-board front brakes, had a much smaller unsprung weight than existing coil spring or leaf designs.
The interconnection transmitted some of the force deflecting a front wheel up over a bump, to push the rear wheel down on the same side.
When the rear wheel met that bump a moment later, it did the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear.
The 2CV had a design brief to be able to be driven at speed over a ploughed field, such as by a farmer transporting chicken eggs.
It originally featured friction dampers and tuned mass dampers.
Later models had tuned mass dampers at the front with telescopic dampers/shock absorbers front and rear.
British Motor Corporation was also an early adopter of interconnected suspension.
A system dubbed Hydrolastic was introduced in 1962 on Morris 1100, and went on to be used on a variety of BMC models.
Hydrolastic was developed by suspension engineer Alex Moulton, and used rubber cones as the springing medium (these were first used on the 1959 Mini) with suspension units on each side connected to each other by a fluid-filled pipe.
The fluid transmitted the force of road bumps from one wheel to the other (on the same principle as Citroën 2CV's mechanical system described above), and because each suspension unit contained valves to restrict the flow of fluid, also served as a shock absorber.
Moulton went on to develop a replacement for Hydrolastic for BMC's successor British Leyland.
This system, manufactured under licence by Dunlop in Coventry, called Hydragas, worked with the same principle, but instead of rubber spring units, it used metal spheres divided internally by a rubber diaphragm.
The top half contained pressurised gas, and the lower half the same fluid as used on the Hydrolastic system.
The fluid transmitted suspension forces between the units on each side, whilst the gas acted as the springing medium through the diaphragm.
This is the same principle as the Citroën hydropneumatic system, and provides similar ride quality, but is self-contained, and does not require an engine-driven pump to provide hydraulic pressure.
The downside is, that Hydragas is, unlike the Citroën system, not height-adjustable, or self-levelling.
Hydragas was introduced in 1973 on Austin Allegro, and was used on several models; the last car to use it being MG F in 2002.
The system was changed in favour of coil springs over dampers due to cost reasons towards the end of the vehicle's life.
When it was decommissioned in 2006, the Hydragas manufacturing line was over 40 years old.
Some of the last post-war Packard models also featured interconnected suspension.
Suspension systems can be broadly classified into two subgroups: dependent and independent.
These terms refer to the ability of opposite wheels to move independently of each other.
A dependent suspension normally has a beam (a simple 'cart' axle) or a (driven) live axle that holds wheels parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axle.
When the camber of one wheel changes, the camber of the opposite wheel changes in the same way (by convention, on one side, this is a positive change in the camber, and on the other side, this a negative change).
De Dion suspensions are also in this category, as they rigidly connect the wheels together.
Independent suspension allows wheels to rise and fall on their own without affecting the opposite wheel.
Suspensions with other devices, such as sway bars that link the wheels in some way, are still classed as independent.
Semi-dependent suspension is a third type.
In this case, the motion of one wheel does affect the position of the other, but they are not rigidly attached to each other.
Twist-beam rear suspension is such a system.
Dependent systems may be differentiated by the system of linkages used to locate them, both longitudinally and transversely.
Often, both functions are combined in a set of linkages.
Longitudinal semi-elliptical springs used to be common, and are still used in heavy-duty trucks and aircraft.
They have the advantage, that the spring rate can easily be made progressive (non-linear).
A single transverse leaf spring for both front wheels and/or both back wheels, supporting solid axles, was used by Ford Motor Company, before and soon after World War II, even on expensive models.
It had the advantages of simplicity and low unsprung weight (compared to other solid-axle designs).
In a front-engine rear-drive vehicle, dependent rear suspension is either "live-axle" or deDion axle, depending on whether or not differential is carried on the axle.
Live-axle is simpler, but unsprung weight contributes to wheel bounce.
Because it assures constant camber, dependent (and semi-independent) suspension is most common on vehicles that need to carry large loads as a proportion of the vehicle's weight, that have relatively soft springs and that do not (for cost and simplicity reasons) use active suspensions.
The use of dependent front suspension has become limited to heavier commercial vehicles.
Transverse leaf springs when used as a suspension link, or four-quarter elliptics on one end of a car are similar to wishbones in geometry, but are more compliant.
Examples are the front of the original Fiat 500, then Panhard Dyna Z, and the early examples of Peugeot 403, and the backs of AC Ace and AC Aceca.
Because the wheels are not constrained to remain perpendicular to a flat road surface in turning, braking, and varying load conditions, control of the wheel camber is an important issue.
Swinging-arm was common in small cars that were sprung softly, and could carry large loads, because the camber is independent of load.
Some active and semi-active suspensions maintain ride height, and therefore the camber, independent of load.
In sports cars, optimal camber change when turning, is more important.
Wishbone and multi-link allow the engineer more control over the geometry, to arrive at the best compromise, than swing axle, MacPherson strut, or swinging arm do; however, the cost and space requirements may be greater.
Semi-trailing arm is in between, being a variable compromise between the geometries of swinging arm and swing axle.
In semi-independent suspensions, the wheels of an axle are able to move relative to one another, as in an independent suspension, but the position of one wheel has an effect on the position and attitude of the other wheel.
This effect is achieved through the twisting or deflecting of suspension parts under load.
The most common type of semi-independent suspension is the twist beam.
The Tilting Suspension System (also known as the Leaning Suspension System) is not a different type or geometry of construction; moreover, it is a technology addition to the conventional suspension system.
This kind of suspension system mainly consists of independent suspension (e.g., MacPherson strut, A-arm (double wishbone)).
With the addition of these suspension systems, there is a further tilting or leaning mechanism that connects the suspension system with the vehicle body (chassis).
The tilting suspension system improves stability, traction, the turning radius of a vehicle, and the comfort of riders as well.
While turning right or left, passengers or objects on a vehicle feel the G-force or inertial force outward the radius of the curvature, which is why two-wheeler riders (motorbikes) lean towards the center of curvature while turning, which improves stability and decreases the chances of toppling.
But vehicles with more than two wheels, and equipped with a conventional suspension system, could not do the same until now, so the passengers feel the outward inertial force, which reduces the stability of riders and their comfort as well.
This kind of tilting suspension system is the solution to the problem.
If the road does not have super-elevation or banking, it will not affect the comfort with this suspension system, the vehicle tilt and decrease in the height of the center of gravity with an increase in stability.
This suspension is also used in fun vehicles.
Some trains also use tilting suspension (Tilting Train) which increases the speed at cornering.
The rocker-bogie system is a suspension arrangement, in which there are some trailing arms fitted with some idler wheels.
Due to articulation between the driving section and the followers, this suspension is very flexible.
This kind of suspension is appropriate for extremely rough terrain.
This kind of suspension was used in the Curiosity rover.
Some vehicles, such as trains, run on long rail tracks fixed to the ground; and some, such as tractors, snow vehicles, and tanks run on continuous tracks that are part of the vehicle.
Although either sort helps to smooth the path and reduce ground pressure, many of the same considerations apply.
Military armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs), including tanks, have specialized suspension requirements.
They can weigh more than seventy tons, and are required to move as quickly as possible over very rough or soft ground.
Their suspension components must be protected from land mines and antitank weapons.
Tracked AFVs can have as many as nine road wheels on each side.
Many wheeled AFVs have six or eight large wheels.
Some have a Central Tire Inflation System to reduce ground loading on poor surfaces.
Some wheels are too big and too confined to turn, so skid steering is used with some wheeled, as well as with tracked vehicles.
The earliest tanks of World War I had fixed suspension with no designed movement whatsoever.
This unsatisfactory situation was improved with leaf spring or coil spring suspensions adopted from agricultural, automotive, or railway machinery, but even these had very limited travel.
Speeds increased due to more powerful engines, and the quality of ride had to be improved.
In the 1930s, the Christie suspension was developed, which allowed the use of coil springs inside a vehicle's armored hull, by changing the direction of force deforming the spring, using a bell crank.
The T-34's suspension was directly descended from Christie designs.
Horstmann suspension was a variation which used a combination of bell crank and exterior coil springs, in use from the 1930s to the 1990s.
The bogie, but nonetheless independent, suspensions of M3 Lee/Grant and M4 Sherman vehicles was similar to the Hortsmann type, with suspension sequestered within the track oval.
By World War II, the other common type was torsion bar suspension, getting spring force from twisting bars inside the hull — this sometimes had less travel than the Christie type, but was significantly more compact, allowing more space inside the hull, with the consequent possibility to install larger turret rings, and thus, heavier main armament.
Torsion-bar suspension, sometimes including shock absorbers, has been the dominant heavy armored vehicle suspension since World War II.
Torsion bars may take space under or near the floor, which may interfere with making the tank low to reduce exposure.
As with cars, wheel travel and spring rate affect the bumpiness of ride, and the speed at which rough terrain can be negotiated.
It may be significant, that a smooth ride, which is often associated with comfort, increases the accuracy when firing on the move.
It also reduces shock on optics and other equipment.
The unsprung weight and track link weight may limit speed on roads, and can affect the useful lifetime of the vehicle's track, and its other components.
Most German WWII half-tracks and their tanks introduced during the war, such as the Panther tank, had overlapping and sometimes interleaved road wheels to distribute the load more evenly on the tank's track, and therefore on the ground.
This apparently made a significant contribution to speed, range and track life, as well as providing a continuous band of protection.
It has not been used since the end of that war, probably due to the maintenance requirements of more complicated mechanical parts working in mud, sand, rocks, snow, and ice; as well as due to cost.
Rocks and frozen mud often got stuck between the overlapping wheels, which could prevent them from turning, or would cause damage to the road wheels.
If one of the interior road wheels were damaged, it would require other road wheels to be removed in order to access the damaged road wheel, making the process more complicated and time-consuming.
A drive wheel is a wheel of a motor vehicle that transmits force, transforming torque into tractive force from the tires to the road, causing the vehicle to move.
The powertrain delivers enough torque to the wheel to overcome stationary forces, resulting in the vehicle moving forwards or backwards.
A two-wheel drive vehicle has two driven wheels, typically both at the front or back, while a four-wheel drive has four.
A steering wheel is a wheel that turns to change the direction of a vehicle.
A trailer wheel is one that is neither a drive wheel, nor a steer wheel.
Front-wheel drive vehicles typically have the rear wheels as trailer wheels.
Front-wheel drive (FWD) vehicles' engines drive the front wheels.
Using the front wheels for delivery of power as well as steering allows the driving force to act in the same direction as the wheel is pointing.
This layout is commonly used in modern passenger cars.
A rare example of front wheel drive was the Opperman Motocart.
This slow-speed agricultural and light freight vehicle was a tricycle with the front wheel carrying a large tractor tyre.
The wheel was powered by a small single cylinder Douglas engine carried on the front mono fork that formed the steering gear.
See also Front-engine, front-wheel drive layout.
Rear-wheel drive (RWD) typically places the engine in the front of the vehicle, with a driveshaft running the length of the vehicle to the differential transmission.
However, mid engine and rear engine layouts can also be used.
It was a common layout used in automobiles throughout the 20th century.
At this time, FWD designs were not practical due to complexity (in FWD, engine power and steering must both be combined in the front axle).
For four-wheeled vehicles, two-wheel drive describes vehicles that transmit torque to at most two road wheels, referred to as either front- or rear-wheel drive.
The term 4x2 is also used, to indicate four total road-wheels with two being driven.
For vehicles that have partial four-wheel drive, the term two-wheel drive refers to the mode when four-wheel drive is deactivated and torque is applied to only two wheels.
This configuration allows all four road wheels to receive torque from the power plant simultaneously.
It is often used in rally racing on mostly paved roads.
Four-wheel drive is common in off-road vehicles because powering all four wheels provides better control on loose and slippery surfaces.
Four-wheel drive manufacturers have different systems such as "High Range 4WD" and "Low Range 4WD".
These systems may provide added features such as a varying of torque distribution between axles or varying gear ratios.
Common terms for this configuration include four-wheel drive, 4WD, 4x4 (pronounced "four-by-four"), integral, and all-wheel drive (AWD).
Ten-wheel drive (10WD, 10×10) is a drivetrain configuration of ten wheels, all of which are driven simultaneously by the engine.
Unlike four-wheel drive drivetrains, this configuration is only used in extreme off-road and military uses, in particular heavy haulage and missile carriers.
Some severe/extreme duty semi tractors may also have this drive configuration.
The Oshkosh M1074 and M1075 prime mover units in the U.S. Army's Palletized Load System (PLS), the U.S. Marine's 10x10 Oshkosh Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), and the Tatra T816 10×10 cargo carrier are examples of ten-wheel drive vehicles.
10x10's are not as common as 4×4's, 6×6's and 8×8's.
Twelve-wheel drive (12WD, 12×12), refers to a twelve-wheeled vehicle with a drivetrain that allows all twelve wheels to receive power from the engine simultaneously.
This configuration is typically used in heavy-duty and extreme off-road and military purposes.
A tell-tale, sometimes called an idiot light or warning light, is an indicator of malfunction or operation of a system, indicated by a binary (on/off) illuminated light, symbol or text legend.
The "idiot light" terminology arises from popular frustration with automakers' use of lights for crucial functions which could previously be monitored by gauges, so a troublesome condition could be detected and corrected early.
Such early detection of problems with, for example, engine temperature or oil pressure or charging system operation is not possible via an idiot light, which lights only when a fault has already occurred – thus providing no advance warnings or details of the malfunction's extent.
The Hudson automobile company was the first to use lights instead of gauges for oil pressure and the voltmeter, starting in the mid-1930s.
Automotive tell-tales are regulated by automobile safety standards worldwide.
In the United States, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101 includes tell-tales in its specifications for vehicle controls and displays.
In Canada, the analogous Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101 applies.
In Europe and throughout most of the rest of the world, ECE Regulations specify various types of tell-tales.
Different tell-tales can convey different kinds of information.
One type lights or blinks to indicate a failure (as of oil pressure, engine temperature control, charging current, etc.); lighting and blinking indicate progression from warning to failure indication.
Another type lights to alert the need for specific service after a certain amount of time or distance has elapsed (e.g., to change the oil).
Colour may also communicate information about the nature of the tell-tale, for example red may signify that the vehicle cannot continue driving (e.g. oil pressure).)
Many older vehicles used schemes which were specific to the manufacturer, e.g. some British Fords of the 1960s used green for oil pressure warning, while many other makes of the same era used amber for oil pressure.
The oil pressure idiot light lights when engine oil pressure drops below a predetermined level.
The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but the engine is not running, as it detects no oil pressure due to the oil pump not operating (the oil pump is powered off the crankshaft, so only operates when the engine is running).
It normally turns off a few seconds after engine start as the oil pump starts working and building up oil pressure.
This tell-tale can bear the legend oil or a pictogram of an oil can.
Some cars illuminate the light red or yellow, depending on the action needed to be taken.
The engine temperature tell-tale is usually installed singly, but has less commonly been installed in pairs.
A pair of lights indicate insufficient (cold, blue) and excessive (hot, red) engine temperature.
A single light usually indicates only an overheat condition in engine.
In electric cars, it is usually to monitor the EV battery temperature and indicate the EV battery is overheating or is too cold to operate.
One example is in a Nissan Leaf EV.
A "malfunction indicator lamp" (MIL) or "check engine light" (CEL) illuminates, usually in red, amber, or yellow, to indicate malfunction or a service requirement detected by the computerized engine management system.
It is found on the instrument console of most automobiles.
In the United States, an MIL with specified functions is required by environmental protection regulations.
Unlike other types of idiot light, an MIL does not correspond to a condition that would have been read out on a gauge.
On vehicles equipped with OBD-II, the light has two stages: it illuminates steadily to indicate a minor fault such as a loose gas cap or malfunction with the vehicle's emissions controls, and it flashes when a severe condition is detected to alert the driver that continued driving may cause severe damage to the engine or catalytic converter emission control system.
The MIL can present a legend, such as check engine, power limited, engine, or service engine soon; or it also can present a pictogram of an engine.
An idiot light can indicate that the vehicle's alternator or generator is not properly charging the battery.
The battery will then discharge, disabling the car.
The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but the engine is not running, as it detects that no power is coming from the alternator (the alternator is powered off the engine so only generates when the engine is running).
It subsequently extinguishes as soon as the engine starts and the alternator starts generating electricity.
This light presents a pictogram of a battery, or it presents the legend amp or batt or gen.
Some vehicles had a single indicator labeled trouble or engine; this was not a Check Engine Light, but a catch-all warning light to indicate trouble that was serious enough to portend an imminent breakdown.
Early 1980s Fords, such as the LTD Crown Victoria, without the instrument option, had only this light, which indicated low oil pressure, overheating and carburetion problems without distinguishing among them.
This usage of the "engine" light was discontinued in the mid-1980s to prevent confusion with the MIL.
Many vehicles have a red tell-tale to indicate that the parking brake is engaged or that there is a fault with the vehicle's braking system.
This tell-tale in most cases bears the ISO symbols for a parking brake and for a braking system emergency.
In the past, US regulations required this tell-tale to bear the legend brake.
Vehicles with anti-lock braking system (ABS) have a lamp to indicate a detected failure.
Tire pressure monitoring systems are often mandated by law.
As a cost-saving measure, individual readouts for each tire are often substituted with a single tell-tale indicator for all tires.
Dashboard indicator lights or tell-tales are provided for turn signals, high beam, transmission mode in automatic transmission vehicles, and similar devices.
These indicate running status and are not an indication of a fault.
Low fuel/charge or re-fuel/re-charge – Appears when vehicle's fuel tank is nearing empty.
Usually shaped like a gas dispenser, or a light next to "E" on the fuel gauge, and (most later cars) a buzzer.
In an EV when the battery runs low, usually shaped with the EV charger symbol or the EV battery symbol and in most cases a buzzer or chime.
Sometimes a "power low warning" indicator is displayed usually shaped like a turtle with a outline circle when the EV battery is critically low.
In a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) when the battery is depleted and vehicle runs low on fuel, both indicators may show indicating to recharge and to refuel.
Glowplugs operating or wait to start (most diesel engines) – Appears when the engine is switched on to indicate the engine glow plugs are operating, and the driver should wait for the light to extinguish before starting the engine.
Usually shaped like a coiled cord.
Fasten driver or passenger seat-belt (usu. with a buzzer) – Appears when the engine is switched and the driver's and/or passenger's seat belt is not buckled.
A pressure sensor in the passenger seat prevents the passenger warning light from activating if the seat is unoccupied.
Usually shaped like a person wearing a seat belt.
EV light (hybrids/PHEVs) to determine if vehicle is in electric operation and engine shut off.
A submarine (or sub) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater.
It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability.
The term is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the midget submarine and the wet sub.
Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size.
Although experimental submarines had been built earlier, submarine design took off during the 19th century, and they were adopted by several navies.
They were first widely used during World War I (1914–1918), and are now used in many navies, large and small.
Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships (merchant and military) or other submarines, and for aircraft carrier protection, blockade running, nuclear deterrence, reconnaissance, conventional land attack (for example, using a cruise missile), and covert insertion of special forces.
Civilian uses include marine science, salvage, exploration, and facility inspection and maintenance.
Submarines can be modified for specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions and undersea cable repair.
They are used in tourism and undersea archaeology.
Modern deep-diving submarines derive from the bathyscaphe, which evolved from the diving bell.
Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, that houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes.
In modern submarines, this structure is the "sail" in American usage and "fin" in European usage.
A "conning tower" was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the boat that allowed the use of shorter periscopes.
There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins.
Smaller, deep-diving, and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional design.
Submarines dive and resurface by means of diving planes and changing the amount of water and air in ballast tanks to affect their buoyancy.
Submarines encompass a wide range of types and capabilities.
They include small autonomous examples, such as one- or two-person subs that operate for a few hours, to vessels that can remain submerged for six months—such as the Russian Typhoon class, the biggest submarines built.
Submarines can work at greater depths than are survivable or practical for human divers.
The word submarine means 'underwater' or 'under-sea' (as in submarine canyon, submarine pipeline) though as a noun it generally refers to a vessel that can travel underwater.
The term is a contraction of submarine boat.
and occurs as such in several languages, e.g. French (sous-marin), and Spanish (submarino), although others retain the original term, such as Dutch (Onderzeeboot), German (Unterseeboot), Swedish (Undervattensbåt), and Russian (подводная лодка: podvodnaya lodka), all of which mean 'submarine boat'.
By naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as boats rather than as ships, regardless of their size.
Although referred to informally as boats, U.S. submarines employ the designation USS (United States Ship) at the beginning of their names, such as USS Alabama.
In the Royal Navy, the designation HMS can refer to "His Majesty's Ship" or "His Majesty's Submarine", though the latter is sometimes rendered "HMS/m" and submarines are generally referred to as boats rather than ships.
Two Greeks submerged and surfaced in the river Tagus near the City of Toledo several times in the presence of The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, without getting wet and with the flame they carried in their hands still alight.
In 1578, the English mathematician William Bourne recorded in his book Inventions or Devises one of the first plans for an underwater navigation vehicle.
A few years later the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his Secret Inventions (1596) that "These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers, other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform."
It is unclear whether he carried out his idea.
Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont (1553–1613) created detailed designs for two types of air-renovated submersible vehicles.
They were equipped with oars, autonomous floating snorkels worked by inner pumps, portholes and gloves used for the crew to manipulate underwater objects.
Ayanaz planned to use them for warfare, using them to approach enemy ships undetected and set up timed gunpowder charges on their hulls.
The first submersible of whose construction there exists reliable information was designed and built in 1620 by Cornelis Drebbel, a Dutchman in the service of James I of England.
It was propelled by means of oars.
By the mid-18th century, over a dozen patents for submarines/submersible boats had been granted in England.
In 1747, Nathaniel Symons patented and built the first known working example of the use of a ballast tank for submersion.
His design used leather bags that could fill with water to submerge the craft.
A mechanism was used to twist the water out of the bags and cause the boat to resurface.
In 1749, the Gentlemen's Magazine reported that a similar design had initially been proposed by Giovanni Borelli in 1680.
Further design improvement stagnated for over a century, until application of new technologies for propulsion and stability.
The first military submersible was Turtle (1775), a hand-powered acorn-shaped device designed by the American David Bushnell to accommodate a single person.
It was the first verified submarine capable of independent underwater operation and movement, and the first to use screws for propulsion.
In 1800, France built Nautilus, a human-powered submarine designed by American Robert Fulton.
They gave up on the experiment in 1804, as did the British, when they reconsidered Fulton's submarine design.
In 1850, Wilhelm Bauer's Brandtaucher was built in Germany.
It remains the oldest known surviving submarine in the world.
In 1864, late in the American Civil War, the Confederate navy's H. L. Hunley became the first military submarine to sink an enemy vessel, the Union sloop-of-war USS Housatonic, using a gun-powder-filled keg on a spar as a torpedo charge.
The Hunley also sank.
The explosion's shock waves may have killed its crew instantly, preventing them from pumping the bilge or propelling the submarine.
In 1866, Sub Marine Explorer was the first submarine to successfully dive, cruise underwater, and resurface under the crew's control.
The design by German American Julius H. Kroehl (in German, Kröhl) incorporated elements that are still used in modern submarines.
In 1866, Flach was built at the Chilean government's request by Karl Flach, a German engineer and immigrant.
It was the fifth submarine built in the world and, along with a second submarine, was intended to defend the port of Valparaiso against attack by the Spanish Navy during the Chincha Islands War.
Submarines could not be put into widespread or routine service use by navies until suitable engines were developed.
The era from 1863 to 1904 marked a pivotal time in submarine development, and several important technologies appeared.
A number of nations built and used submarines.
Diesel electric propulsion became the dominant power system and equipment such as the periscope became standardized.
Countries conducted many experiments on effective tactics and weapons for submarines, which led to their large impact in World War I.
The first submarine not relying on human power for propulsion was the French Plongeur (Diver), launched in 1863, which used compressed air at 1,200 kPa (180 psi).
Narcís Monturiol designed the first air-independent and combustion-powered submarine, Ictíneo II, which was launched in Barcelona, Spain in 1864.
The submarine became a potentially viable weapon with the development of the Whitehead torpedo, designed in 1866 by British engineer Robert Whitehead, the first practical self-propelled or "locomotive" torpedo.
The spar torpedo that had been developed earlier by the Confederate States Navy was considered to be impracticable, as it was believed to have sunk both its intended target, and H. L. Hunley, the submarine that deployed it.
The Irish inventor John Philip Holland built a model submarine in 1876 and in 1878 demonstrated the Holland I prototype.
This was followed by a number of unsuccessful designs.
In 1896, he designed the Holland Type VI submarine, which used internal combustion engine power on the surface and electric battery power underwater.
Launched on 17 May 1897 at Navy Lt. Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Holland VI was purchased by the United States Navy on 11 April 1900, becoming the Navy's first commissioned submarine, christened USS Holland.
Discussions between the English clergyman and inventor George Garrett and the Swedish industrialist Thorsten Nordenfelt led to the first practical steam-powered submarines, armed with torpedoes and ready for military use.
The first was Nordenfelt I, a 56-tonne, 19.5-metre (64 ft) vessel similar to Garrett's ill-fated Resurgam (1879), with a range of 240 kilometres (130 nmi; 150 mi), armed with a single torpedo, in 1885.
A reliable means of propulsion for the submerged vessel was only made possible in the 1880s with the advent of the necessary electric battery technology.
The first electrically powered boats were built by Isaac Peral y Caballero in Spain (who built Peral), Dupuy de Lôme (who built Gymnote) and Gustave Zédé (who built Sirène) in France, and James Franklin Waddington (who built Porpoise) in England.
Peral's design featured torpedoes and other systems that later became standard in submarines.
Commissioned in June 1900, the French steam and electric Narval employed the now typical double-hull design, with a pressure hull inside the outer shell.
These 200-ton ships had a range of over 160 km (100 mi) underwater.
The French submarine Aigrette in 1904 further improved the concept by using a diesel rather than a gasoline engine for surface power.
Large numbers of these submarines were built, with seventy-six completed before 1914.
The Royal Navy commissioned five Holland-class submarines from Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness, under licence from the Holland Torpedo Boat Company from 1901 to 1903.
Construction of the boats took longer than anticipated, with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on 6 April 1902.
Although the design had been purchased entirely from the US company, the actual design used was an untested improvement to the original Holland design using a new 180 horsepower (130 kW) petrol engine.
These types of submarines were first used during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05.
Due to the blockade at Port Arthur, the Russians sent their submarines to Vladivostok, where by 1 January 1905 there were seven boats, enough to create the world's first "operational submarine fleet".
The new submarine fleet began patrols on 14 February, usually lasting for about 24 hours each.
The first confrontation with Japanese warships occurred on 29 April 1905 when the Russian submarine Som was fired upon by Japanese torpedo boats, but then withdrew.
Military submarines first made a significant impact in World War I. Forces such as the U-boats of Germany saw action in the First Battle of the Atlantic, and were responsible for sinking RMS Lusitania, which was sunk as a result of unrestricted submarine warfare and is often cited among the reasons for the entry of the United States into the war.
At the outbreak of the war, Germany had only twenty submarines available for combat, although these included vessels of the diesel-engined U-19 class, which had a sufficient range of 5,000 miles (8,000 km) and speed of 8 knots (15 km/h) to allow them to operate effectively around the entire British coast.
, By contrast, the Royal Navy had a total of 74 submarines, though of mixed effectiveness.
In August 1914, a flotilla of ten U-boats sailed from their base in Heligoland to attack Royal Navy warships in the North Sea in the first submarine war patrol in history.
The U-boats' ability to function as practical war machines relied on new tactics, their numbers, and submarine technologies such as combination diesel–electric power system developed in the preceding years.
More submersibles than true submarines, U-boats operated primarily on the surface using regular engines, submerging occasionally to attack under battery power.
They were roughly triangular in cross-section, with a distinct keel to control rolling while surfaced, and a distinct bow.
During World War I more than 5,000 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats.
The British responded to the German developments in submarine technology with the creation of the K-class submarines.
However, these submarines were notoriously dangerous to operate due to their various design flaws and poor maneuverability.
During World War II, Germany used submarines to devastating effect in the Battle of the Atlantic, where it attempted to cut Britain's supply routes by sinking more merchant ships than Britain could replace.
These merchant ships were vital to supply Britain's population with food, industry with raw material, and armed forces with fuel and armaments.
Although the U-boats had been updated in the interwar years, the major innovation was improved communications, encrypted using the Enigma cipher machine.
This allowed for mass-attack naval tactics (Rudeltaktik, commonly known as "wolfpack"), which ultimately ceased to be effective when the U-boat's Enigma was cracked.
By the end of the war, almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships, 2,825 merchantmen) had been sunk by U-boats.
Although successful early in the war, Germany's U-boat fleet suffered heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners out of 41,000, a casualty rate of about 70%.
The Imperial Japanese Navy operated the most varied fleet of submarines of any navy, including Kaiten crewed torpedoes, midget submarines (Type A Ko-hyoteki and Kairyu classes), medium-range submarines, purpose-built supply submarines and long-range fleet submarines.
They also had submarines with the highest submerged speeds during World War II (I-201-class submarines) and submarines that could carry multiple aircraft (I-400-class submarines).
They were also equipped with one of the most advanced torpedoes of the conflict, the oxygen-propelled Type 95.
Nevertheless, despite their technical prowess, Japan chose to use its submarines for fleet warfare, and consequently were relatively unsuccessful, as warships were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships.
The submarine force was the most effective anti-ship weapon in the American arsenal.
Submarines, though only about 2 percent of the U.S. Navy, destroyed over 30 percent of the Japanese Navy, including 8 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship and 11 cruisers.
US submarines also destroyed over 60 percent of the Japanese merchant fleet, crippling Japan's ability to supply its military forces and industrial war effort.
Allied submarines in the Pacific War destroyed more Japanese shipping than all other weapons combined.
This feat was considerably aided by the Imperial Japanese Navy's failure to provide adequate escort forces for the nation's merchant fleet.
During World War II, 314 submarines served in the US Navy, of which nearly 260 were deployed to the Pacific.
When the Japanese attacked Hawaii in December 1941, 111 boats were in commission; 203 submarines from the Gato, Balao, and Tench classes were commissioned during the war.
During the war, 52 US submarines were lost to all causes, with 48 directly due to hostilities.
US submarines sank 1,560 enemy vessels, a total tonnage of 5.3 million tons (55% of the total sunk).
The Royal Navy Submarine Service was used primarily in the classic Axis blockade.
Its major operating areas were around Norway, in the Mediterranean (against the Axis supply routes to North Africa), and in the Far East.
In that war, British submarines sank 2 million tons of enemy shipping and 57 major warships, the latter including 35 submarines.
Among these is the only documented instance of a submarine sinking another submarine while both were submerged.
This occurred when HMS Venturer engaged U-864; the Venturer crew manually computed a successful firing solution against a three-dimensionally maneuvering target using techniques which became the basis of modern torpedo computer targeting systems.
Seventy-four British submarines were lost, the majority, forty-two, in the Mediterranean.
The first launch of a cruise missile (SSM-N-8 Regulus) from a submarine occurred in July 1953, from the deck of USS Tunny, a World War II fleet boat modified to carry the missile with a nuclear warhead.
Tunny and its sister boat, Barbero, were the United States' first nuclear deterrent patrol submarines.
In the 1950s, nuclear power partially replaced diesel–electric propulsion.
Equipment was also developed to extract oxygen from sea water.
These two innovations gave submarines the ability to remain submerged for weeks or months.
Most of the naval submarines built since that time in the US, the Soviet Union (now Russia), the UK, and France have been powered by a nuclear reactor.
In 1959–1960, the first ballistic missile submarines were put into service by both the United States (George Washington class) and the Soviet Union (Golf class) as part of the Cold War nuclear deterrent strategy.
During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union maintained large submarine fleets that engaged in cat-and-mouse games.
The Soviet Union lost at least four submarines during this period: K-129 was lost in 1968 (a part of which the CIA retrieved from the ocean floor with the Howard Hughes-designed ship Glomar Explorer), K-8 in 1970, K-219 in 1986, and Komsomolets in 1989 (which held a depth record among military submarines—1,000 m (3,300 ft)).
Many other Soviet subs, such as K-19 (the first Soviet nuclear submarine, and the first Soviet sub to reach the North Pole) were badly damaged by fire or radiation leaks.
The US lost two nuclear submarines during this time: USS Thresher due to equipment failure during a test dive while at its operational limit, and USS Scorpion due to unknown causes.
During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Pakistan Navy's Hangor sank the Indian frigate INS Khukri.
This was the first sinking by a submarine since World War II.
During the same war, Ghazi, a Tench-class submarine on loan to Pakistan from the US, was sunk by the Indian Navy.
It was the first submarine combat loss since World War II.
In 1982 during the Falklands War, the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was sunk by the British submarine HMS Conqueror, the first sinking by a nuclear-powered submarine in war.
Some weeks later, on 16 June, during the Lebanon War, an unnamed Israeli submarine torpedoed and sank the Lebanese coaster Transit, which was carrying 56 Palestinian refugees to Cyprus, in the belief that the vessel was evacuating anti-Israeli militias.
The ship was hit by two torpedoes, managed to run aground but eventually sank.
There were 25 dead, including her captain.
The Israeli Navy disclosed the incident in November 2018.
Before and during World War II, the primary role of the submarine was anti-surface ship warfare.
Submarines would attack either on the surface using deck guns, or submerged using torpedoes.
They were particularly effective in sinking Allied transatlantic shipping in both World Wars, and in disrupting Japanese supply routes and naval operations in the Pacific in World War II.
Mine-laying submarines were developed in the early part of the 20th century.
The facility was used in both World Wars.
Submarines were also used for inserting and removing covert agents and military forces in special operations, for intelligence gathering, and to rescue aircrew during air attacks on islands, where the airmen would be told of safe places to crash-land so the submarines could rescue them.
Submarines could carry cargo through hostile waters or act as supply vessels for other submarines.
Submarines could usually locate and attack other submarines only on the surface, although HMS Venturer managed to sink U-864 with a four torpedo spread while both were submerged.
The British developed a specialized anti-submarine submarine in WWI, the R class.
After WWII, with the development of the homing torpedo, better sonar systems, and nuclear propulsion, submarines also became able to hunt each other effectively.
The development of submarine-launched ballistic missile and submarine-launched cruise missiles gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from cluster bombs to nuclear weapons.
The primary defense of a submarine lies in its ability to remain concealed in the depths of the ocean.
Early submarines could be detected by the sound they made.
Water is an excellent conductor of sound (much better than air), and submarines can detect and track comparatively noisy surface ships from long distances.
Modern submarines are built with an emphasis on stealth.
Advanced propeller designs, extensive sound-reducing insulation, and special machinery help a submarine remain as quiet as ambient ocean noise, making them difficult to detect.
It takes specialized technology to find and attack modern submarines.
Active sonar uses the reflection of sound emitted from the search equipment to detect submarines.
It has been used since WWII by surface ships, submarines and aircraft (via dropped buoys and helicopter "dipping" arrays), but it reveals the emitter's position, and is susceptible to counter-measures.
A concealed military submarine is a real threat, and because of its stealth, can force an enemy navy to waste resources searching large areas of ocean and protecting ships against attack.
This advantage was vividly demonstrated in the 1982 Falklands War when the British nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror sank the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano.
After the sinking the Argentine Navy recognized that they had no effective defense against submarine attack, and the Argentine surface fleet withdrew to port for the remainder of the war.
An Argentine submarine remained at sea, however.
Although the majority of the world's submarines are military, there are some civilian submarines, which are used for tourism, exploration, oil and gas platform inspections, and pipeline surveys.
Some are also used in illegal activities.
The Submarine Voyage ride opened at Disneyland in 1959, but although it ran under water it was not a true submarine, as it ran on tracks and was open to the atmosphere.
The first tourist submarine was Auguste Piccard, which went into service in 1964 at Expo64.
By 1997, there were 45 tourist submarines operating around the world.
Submarines with a crush depth in the range of 400–500 feet (120–150 m) are operated in several areas worldwide, typically with bottom depths around 100 to 120 feet (30 to 37 m), with a carrying capacity of 50 to 100 passengers.
In a typical operation a surface vessel carries passengers to an offshore operating area and loads them into the submarine.
The submarine then visits underwater points of interest such as natural or artificial reef structures.
To surface safely without danger of collision the location of the submarine is marked with an air release and movement to the surface is coordinated by an observer in a support craft.
A recent development is the deployment of so-called narco-submarines by South American drug smugglers to evade law enforcement detection.
Although they occasionally deploy true submarines, most are self-propelled semi-submersibles, where a portion of the craft remains above water at all times.
In September 2011, Colombian authorities seized a 16-meter-long submersible that could hold a crew of 5, costing about $2 million.
The vessel belonged to FARC rebels and had the capacity to carry at least 7 tonnes of drugs.

All surface ships, as well as surfaced submarines, are in a positively buoyant condition, weighing less than the volume of water they would displace if fully submerged.
To submerge hydrostatically, a ship must have negative buoyancy, either by increasing its own weight or decreasing its displacement of water.
To control their displacement and weight, submarines have ballast tanks, which can hold varying amounts of water and air.
For general submersion or surfacing, submarines use the main ballast tanks (MBTs), which are ambient pressure tanks, filled with water to submerge or with air to surface.
While submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines, these tanks are a section of the space between the light hull and the pressure hull.
For more precise control of depth, submarines use smaller depth control tanks (DCTs)—also called hard tanks (due to their ability to withstand higher pressure) or trim tanks.
These are variable buoyancy pressure vessels, a type of buoyancy control device.
The amount of water in depth control tanks can be adjusted to hydrostatically change depth or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (mainly water density) change.
Depth control tanks may be located either near the submarine's center of gravity, to minimise the effect on trim, or separated along the length of the hull so they can also be used to adjust static trim by transfer of water between them.
When submerged, the water pressure on a submarine's hull can reach 4 MPa (580 psi) for steel submarines and up to 10 MPa (1,500 psi) for titanium submarines like K-278 Komsomolets, while interior pressure remains relatively unchanged.
This difference results in hull compression, which decreases displacement.
Water density also marginally increases with depth, as the salinity and pressure are higher.
This change in density incompletely compensates for hull compression, so buoyancy decreases as depth increases.
A submerged submarine is in an unstable equilibrium, having a tendency to either sink or float to the surface.
Keeping a constant depth requires continual operation of either the depth control tanks or control surfaces.
Submarines in a neutral buoyancy condition are not intrinsically trim-stable.
To maintain desired longitudinal trim, submarines use forward and aft trim tanks.
Pumps move water between the tanks, changing weight distribution and pitching the sub up or down.
A similar system may be used to maintain transverse trim.
The hydrostatic effect of variable ballast tanks is not the only way to control the submarine underwater.
Hydrodynamic maneuvering is done by several control surfaces, collectively known as diving planes or hydroplanes, which can be moved to create hydrodynamic forces when a submarine moves longitudinally at sufficient speed.
In the classic cruciform stern configuration, the horizontal stern planes serve the same purpose as the trim tanks, controlling the trim.
Most submarines additionally have forward horizontal planes, normally placed on the bow until the 1960s but often on the sail on later designs, where they are closer to the center of gravity and can control depth with less effect on the trim.
An obvious way to configure the control surfaces at the stern of a submarine is to use vertical planes to control yaw and horizontal planes to control pitch, which gives them the shape of a cross when seen from astern of the vessel.
In this configuration, which long remained the dominant one, the horizontal planes are used to control the trim and depth and the vertical planes to control sideways maneuvers, like the rudder of a surface ship.
Alternatively, the rear control surfaces can be combined into what has become known as an x-stern or an x-rudder.
Although less intuitive, such a configuration has turned out to have several advantages over the traditional cruciform arrangement.
First, it improves maneuverability, horizontally as well as vertically.
Second, the control surfaces are less likely to get damaged when landing on, or departing from, the seabed as well as when mooring and unmooring alongside.
Finally, it is safer in that one of the two diagonal lines can counteract the other with respect to vertical as well as horizontal motion if one of them accidentally gets stuck.
The x-stern was first tried in practice in the early 1960s on the USS Albacore, an experimental submarine of the US Navy.
While the arrangement was found to be advantageous, it was nevertheless not used on US production submarines that followed due to the fact that it requires the use of a computer to manipulate the control surfaces to the desired effect.
Instead, the first to use an x-stern in standard operations was the Swedish Navy with its Sjöormen class, the lead submarine of which was launched in 1967, before the Albacore had even finished her test runs.
Since it turned out to work very well in practice, all subsequent classes of Swedish submarines (Näcken, Västergötland, Gotland, and Blekinge class) have or will come with an x-rudder.
The Kockums shipyard responsible for the design of the x-stern on Swedish submarines eventually exported it to Australia with the Collins class as well as to Japan with the Sōryū class.
With the introduction of the type 212, the German and Italian Navies came to feature it as well.
The US Navy with its Columbia class, the British Navy with its Dreadnought class, and the French Navy with its Barracuda class are all about to join the x-stern family.
Hence, as judged by the situation in the early 2020s, the x-stern is about to become the dominant technology.
When a submarine performs an emergency surfacing, all depth and trim control methods are used simultaneously, together with propelling the boat upwards.
Such surfacing is very quick, so the vessel may even partially jump out of the water, potentially damaging submarine systems.
Modern submarines are cigar-shaped.
This design, also used in very early submarines, is sometimes called a "teardrop hull".
It reduces hydrodynamic drag when the sub is submerged, but decreases the sea-keeping capabilities and increases drag while surfaced.
Since the limitations of the propulsion systems of early submarines forced them to operate surfaced most of the time, their hull designs were a compromise.
Because of the slow submerged speeds of those subs, usually, well below 10 kt (18 km/h), the increased drag for underwater travel was acceptable.
Late in World War II, when technology allowed faster and longer submerged operation and increased aircraft surveillance forced submarines to stay submerged, hull designs became teardrop shaped again to reduce drag and noise.
USS Albacore (AGSS-569) was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form (sometimes referred to as an "Albacore hull") of modern submarines.
On modern military submarines the outer hull is covered with a layer of sound-absorbing rubber, or anechoic plating, to reduce detection.
The occupied pressure hulls of deep-diving submarines such as DSV Alvin are spherical instead of cylindrical.
This allows a more even distribution of stress and efficient use of materials to withstand external pressure as it gives the most internal volume for structural weight and is the most efficient shape to avoid buckling instability in compression.
A frame is usually affixed to the outside of the pressure hull, providing attachment for ballast and trim systems, scientific instrumentation, battery packs, syntactic flotation foam, and lighting.
A raised tower on top of a standard submarine accommodates the periscope and electronics masts, which can include radio, radar, electronic warfare, and other systems.
It might also include a snorkel mast.
In many early classes of submarines (see history), the control room, or "conn", was located inside this tower, which was known as the "conning tower".
Since then, the conn has been located within the hull of the submarine, and the tower is now called the "sail" or "fin".
The conn is distinct from the "bridge", a small open platform in the top of the sail, used for observation during surface operation.
"Bathtubs" are related to conning towers but are used on smaller submarines.
The bathtub is a metal cylinder surrounding the hatch that prevents waves from breaking directly into the cabin.
It is needed because surfaced submarines have limited freeboard, that is, they lie low in the water.
Bathtubs help prevent swamping the vessel.
Modern submarines and submersibles usually have, as did the earliest models, a single hull.
Large submarines generally have an additional hull or hull sections outside.
This external hull, which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer hull (casing in the Royal Navy) or light hull, as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference.
Inside the outer hull there is a strong hull, or pressure hull, which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside.
As early as World War I, it was realized that the optimal shape for withstanding pressure conflicted with the optimal shape for seakeeping and minimal drag at the surface, and construction difficulties further complicated the problem.
This was solved either by a compromise shape, or by using two layered hulls: the internal strength hull for withstanding pressure, and an external fairing for hydrodynamic shape.
Until the end of World War II, most submarines had an additional partial casing on the top, bow and stern, built of thinner metal, which was flooded when submerged.
Germany went further with the Type XXI, a general predecessor of modern submarines, in which the pressure hull was fully enclosed inside the light hull, but optimized for submerged navigation, unlike earlier designs that were optimized for surface operation.
After World War II, approaches split.
The Soviet Union changed its designs, basing them on German developments.
All post-World War II heavy Soviet and Russian submarines are built with a double hull structure.
American and most other Western submarines switched to a primarily single-hull approach.
They still have light hull sections in the bow and stern, which house main ballast tanks and provide a hydrodynamically optimized shape, but the main cylindrical hull section has only a single plating layer.
Double hulls are being considered for future submarines in the United States to improve payload capacity, stealth and range.
The pressure hull is generally constructed of thick high-strength steel with a complex structure and high strength reserve, and is separated by watertight bulkheads into several compartments.
There are also examples of more than two hulls in a submarine, like the Typhoon class, which has two main pressure hulls and three smaller ones for control room, torpedoes and steering gear, with the missile launch system between the main hulls, all surrounded and supported by the outer light hydrodynamic hull.
When submerged the pressure hull provides most of the buoyancy for the whole vessel.
The dive depth cannot be increased easily.
Simply making the hull thicker increases the structural weight and requires reduction of onboard equipment weight, and increasing the diameter requires a proportional increase in thickness for the same material and architecture, ultimately resulting in a pressure hull that does not have sufficient buoyancy to support its own weight, as in a bathyscaphe.
This is acceptable for civilian research submersibles, but not military submarines, which need to carry a large equipment, crew, and weapons load to fulfill their function.
Construction materials with greater specific strength and specific modulus are needed.
WWI submarines had hulls of carbon steel, with a 100-metre (330 ft) maximum depth.
During WWII, high-strength alloyed steel was introduced, allowing 200-metre (660 ft) depths.
High-strength alloy steel remains the primary material for submarines today, with 250–400-metre (820–1,310 ft) depths, which cannot be exceeded on a military submarine without design compromises.
To exceed that limit, a few submarines were built with titanium hulls.
Titanium alloys can be stronger than steel, lighter, and most importantly, have higher immersed specific strength and specific modulus.
Titanium is also not ferromagnetic, important for stealth.
Titanium submarines were built by the Soviet Union, which developed specialized high-strength alloys.
It has produced several types of titanium submarines.
Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth, but other systems must be redesigned to cope, so test depth was limited to 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) for the Soviet submarine K-278 Komsomolets, the deepest-diving combat submarine.
An Alfa-class submarine may have successfully operated at 1,300 metres (4,300 ft), though continuous operation at such depths would produce excessive stress on many submarine systems.
Titanium does not flex as readily as steel, and may become brittle after many dive cycles.
Despite its benefits, the high cost of titanium construction led to the abandonment of titanium submarine construction as the Cold War ended.
Deep-diving civilian submarines have used thick acrylic pressure hulls.
Although the specific strength and specific modulus of acrylic are not very high, the density is only 1.18g/cm3, so it is only very slightly denser than water, and the buoyancy penalty of increased thickness is correspondingly low.
The deepest deep-submergence vehicle (DSV) to date is Trieste.
On 5 October 1959, Trieste departed San Diego for Guam aboard the freighter Santa Maria to participate in Project Nekton, a series of very deep dives in the Mariana Trench.
On 23 January 1960, Trieste reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying Jacques Piccard (son of Auguste) and Lieutenant Don Walsh, USN.
This was the first time a vessel, crewed or uncrewed, had reached the deepest point in the Earth's oceans.
The onboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 metres (37,799 ft), although this was later revised to 10,916 metres (35,814 ft) and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep slightly shallower, at 10,911 metres (35,797 ft).
The first submarines were propelled by humans.
The first mechanically driven submarine was the 1863 French Plongeur, which used compressed air for propulsion.
Anaerobic propulsion was first employed by the Spanish Ictineo II in 1864, which used a solution of zinc, manganese dioxide, and potassium chlorate to generate sufficient heat to power a steam engine, while also providing oxygen for the crew.
A similar system was not employed again until 1940 when the German Navy tested a hydrogen peroxide-based system, the Walter turbine, on the experimental V-80 submarine and later on the naval U-791 and type XVII submarines; the system was further developed for the British Explorer-class, completed in 1958.
Until the advent of nuclear marine propulsion, most 20th-century submarines used electric motors and batteries for running underwater and combustion engines on the surface, and for battery recharging.
Early submarines used gasoline (petrol) engines but this quickly gave way to kerosene (paraffin) and then diesel engines because of reduced flammability and, with diesel, improved fuel-efficiency and thus also greater range.
A combination of diesel and electric propulsion became the norm.
Initially, the combustion engine and the electric motor were in most cases connected to the same shaft so that both could directly drive the propeller.
The combustion engine was placed at the front end of the stern section with the electric motor behind it followed by the propeller shaft.
The engine was connected to the motor by a clutch and the motor in turn connected to the propeller shaft by another clutch.
With only the rear clutch engaged, the electric motor could drive the propeller, as required for fully submerged operation.
With both clutches engaged, the combustion engine could drive the propeller, as was possible when operating on the surface or, at a later stage, when snorkeling.
The electric motor would in this case serve as a generator to charge the batteries or, if no charging was needed, be allowed to rotate freely.
With only the front clutch engaged, the combustion engine could drive the electric motor as a generator for charging the batteries without simultaneously forcing the propeller to move.
The motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft, which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called "group down" and "group up", respectively).
While most early submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the combustion engine and the propeller, an alternative solution was considered as well as implemented at a very early stage.
That solution consists in first converting the work of the combustion engine into electric energy via a dedicated generator.
This energy is then used to drive the propeller via the electric motor and, to the extent required, for charging the batteries.
In this configuration, the electric motor is thus responsible for driving the propeller at all times, regardless of whether air is available so that the combustion engine can also be used or not.
Among the pioneers of this alternative solution was the very first submarine of the Swedish Navy, HMS Hajen (later renamed Ub no 1), launched in 1904.
While its design was generally inspired by the first submarine commissioned by the US Navy, USS Holland, it deviated from the latter in at least three significant ways: by adding a periscope, by replacing the gasoline engine by a semidiesel engine (a hot-bulb engine primarily meant to be fueled by kerosene, later replaced by a true diesel engine) and by severing the mechanical link between the combustion engine and the propeller by instead letting the former drive a dedicated generator.
By so doing, it took three significant steps toward what was eventually to become the dominant technology for conventional (i.e., non-nuclear) submarines.
In the following years, the Swedish Navy added another seven submarines in three different classes (2nd class, Laxen class, and Braxen class) using the same propulsion technology but fitted with true diesel engines rather than semidiesels from the outset.
Since by that time, the technology was usually based on the diesel engine rather than some other type of combustion engine, it eventually came to be known as diesel–electric transmission.
Like many other early submarines, those initially designed in Sweden were quite small (less than 200 tonnes) and thus confined to littoral operation.
When the Swedish Navy wanted to add larger vessels, capable of operating further from the shore, their designs were purchased from companies abroad that already had the required experience: first Italian (Fiat-Laurenti) and later German (A.G. Weser and IvS).
As a side-effect, the diesel–electric transmission was temporarily abandoned.
However, diesel–electric transmission was immediately reintroduced when Sweden began designing its own submarines again in the mid-1930s.
From that point onwards, it has been consistently used for all new classes of Swedish submarines, albeit supplemented by air-independent propulsion (AIP) as provided by Stirling engines beginning with HMS Näcken in 1988.
Another early adopter of diesel–electric transmission was the US Navy, whose Bureau of Engineering proposed its use in 1928.
It was subsequently tried in the S-class submarines S-3, S-6, and S-7 before being put into production with the Porpoise class of the 1930s.
From that point onwards, it continued to be used on most US conventional submarines.
Apart from the British U-class and some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy that used separate diesel generators for low speed running, few navies other than those of Sweden and the US made much use of diesel–electric transmission before 1945.
After World War II, by contrast, it gradually became the dominant mode of propulsion for conventional submarines.
However, its adoption was not always swift.
Notably, the Soviet Navy did not introduce diesel–electric transmission on its conventional submarines until 1980 with its Paltus class.
It entails a loss of fuel-efficiency as well as power by converting the output of the diesel engine into electricity.
While both generators and electric motors are known to be very efficient, their efficiency nevertheless falls short of 100 percent.
It requires an additional component in the form of a dedicated generator.
Since the electric motor is always used to drive the propeller it can no longer step in to take on generator service as well.
It does not allow the diesel engine and the electrical motor to join forces by simultaneously driving the propeller mechanically for maximum speed when the submarine is surfaced or snorkeling.
This may, however, be of little practical importance inasmuch as the option it prevents is one that would leave the submarine at a risk of having to dive with its batteries at least partly depleted.
It reduces external noise by severing the direct and rigid mechanical link between the relatively noisy diesel engine(s) on the one hand and the propeller shaft(s) and hull on the other.
With stealth being of paramount importance to submarines, this is a very significant advantage.
It increases the readiness to dive, which is of course of vital importance for a submarine.
The only thing required from a propulsion point of view is to shut down the diesel(s).
It makes the speed of the diesel engine(s) temporarily independent of the speed of the submarine.
This in turn often makes it possible to run the diesel(s) at close to optimal speed from a fuel-efficiency as well as durability point of view.
It also makes it possible to reduce the time spent surfaced or snorkeling by running the diesel(s) at maximum speed without affecting the speed of the submarine itself.
It eliminates the clutches otherwise required to connect the diesel engine, the electric motor, and the propeller shaft.
This in turn saves space, increases reliability and reduces maintenance costs.
It increases flexibility with regard to how the driveline components are configured, positioned, and maintained.
For example, the diesel no longer has to be aligned with the electric motor and propeller shaft, two diesels can be used to power a single propeller (or vice versa), and one diesel can be turned off for maintenance as long as a second is available to provide the required amount of electricity.
It facilitates the integration of additional primary sources of energy, beside the diesel engine(s), such as various kinds of air-independent power (AIP) systems.
With one or more electric motors always driving the propeller(s), such systems can easily be introduced as yet another source of electric energy in addition to the diesel engine(s) and the batteries.
During World War II the Germans experimented with the idea of the schnorchel (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines but did not see the need for them until rather late in the war.
The schnorchel is a retractable pipe that supplies air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth, allowing the boat to cruise and recharge its batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth.
Especially as first implemented however, it turned out to be far from a perfect solution.
There were problems with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather.
Since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries.
Speed was limited to 8 knots (15 km/h), lest the device snap from stress.
The schnorchel also created noise that made the boat easier to detect with sonar, yet more difficult for the on-board sonar to detect signals from other vessels.
Finally, allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the schnorchel mast could be detected beyond visual range.
While the snorkel renders a submarine far less detectable, it is thus not perfect.
In clear weather, diesel exhausts can be seen on the surface to a distance of about three miles, while "periscope feather" (the wave created by the snorkel or periscope moving through the water) is visible from far off in calm sea conditions.
Modern radar is also capable of detecting a snorkel in calm sea conditions.
The problem of the diesels causing a vacuum in the submarine when the head valve is submerged still exists in later model diesel submarines but is mitigated by high-vacuum cut-off sensors that shut down the engines when the vacuum in the ship reaches a pre-set point.
Modern snorkel induction masts have a fail-safe design using compressed air, controlled by a simple electrical circuit, to hold the "head valve" open against the pull of a powerful spring.
Seawater washing over the mast shorts out exposed electrodes on top, breaking the control, and shutting the "head valve" while it is submerged.
US submarines did not adopt the use of snorkels until after WWII.
During World War II, German Type XXI submarines (also known as "Elektroboote") were the first submarines designed to operate submerged for extended periods.
Initially they were to carry hydrogen peroxide for long-term, fast air-independent propulsion, but were ultimately built with very large batteries instead.
At the end of the War, the British and Soviets experimented with hydrogen peroxide/kerosene (paraffin) engines that could run surfaced and submerged.
The results were not encouraging.
Though the Soviet Union deployed a class of submarines with this engine type (codenamed Quebec by NATO), they were considered unsuccessful.
The United States also used hydrogen peroxide in an experimental midget submarine, X-1.
It was originally powered by a hydrogen peroxide/diesel engine and battery system until an explosion of her hydrogen peroxide supply on 20 May 1957.
X-1 was later converted to use diesel–electric drive.
Today several navies use air-independent propulsion.
Notably Sweden uses Stirling technology on the Gotland-class and Södermanland-class submarines.
The Stirling engine is heated by burning diesel fuel with liquid oxygen from cryogenic tanks.
A newer development in air-independent propulsion is hydrogen fuel cells, first used on the German Type 212 submarine, with nine 34 kW or two 120 kW cells.
Fuel cells are also used in the new Spanish S-80-class submarines although with the fuel stored as ethanol and then converted into hydrogen before use.
One new technology that is being introduced starting with the Japanese Navy's eleventh Sōryū-class submarine (JS Ōryū) is a more modern battery, the lithium-ion battery.
These batteries have about double the electric storage of traditional batteries, and by changing out the lead-acid batteries in their normal storage areas plus filling up the large hull space normally devoted to AIP engine and fuel tanks with many tons of lithium-ion batteries, modern submarines can actually return to a "pure" diesel–electric configuration yet have the added underwater range and power normally associated with AIP equipped submarines.
Steam power was resurrected in the 1950s with a nuclear-powered steam turbine driving a generator.
By eliminating the need for atmospheric oxygen, the time that a submarine could remain submerged was limited only by its food stores, as breathing air was recycled and fresh water distilled from seawater.
More importantly, a nuclear submarine has unlimited range at top speed.
This allows it to travel from its operating base to the combat zone in a much shorter time and makes it a far more difficult target for most anti-submarine weapons.
Nuclear-powered submarines have a relatively small battery and diesel engine/generator powerplant for emergency use if the reactors must be shut down.
Nuclear power is now used in all large submarines, but due to the high cost and large size of nuclear reactors, smaller submarines still use diesel–electric propulsion.
The ratio of larger to smaller submarines depends on strategic needs.
The US Navy, French Navy, and the British Royal Navy operate only nuclear submarines, which is explained by the need for distant operations.
Other major operators rely on a mix of nuclear submarines for strategic purposes and diesel–electric submarines for defense.
Most fleets have no nuclear submarines, due to the limited availability of nuclear power and submarine technology.
Diesel–electric submarines have a stealth advantage over their nuclear counterparts.
Nuclear submarines generate noise from coolant pumps and turbo-machinery needed to operate the reactor, even at low power levels.
Some nuclear submarines such as the American Ohio class can operate with their reactor coolant pumps secured, making them quieter than electric subs.
A conventional submarine operating on batteries is almost completely silent, the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow noise around the hull, all of which stops when the sub hovers in mid-water to listen, leaving only the noise from crew activity.
Commercial submarines usually rely only on batteries, since they operate in conjunction with a mother ship.
Several serious nuclear and radiation accidents have involved nuclear submarine mishaps.
The Soviet submarine K-19 reactor accident in 1961 resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation.
The Soviet submarine K-27 reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries.
The Soviet submarine K-431 accident in 1985 resulted in 10 fatalities and 49 other radiation injuries.
Oil-fired steam turbines powered the British K-class submarines, built during World War I and later, to give them the surface speed to keep up with the battle fleet.
The K-class subs were not very successful, however.
Toward the end of the 20th century, some submarines—such as the British Vanguard class—began to be fitted with pump-jet propulsors instead of propellers.
Though these are heavier, more expensive, and less efficient than a propeller, they are significantly quieter, providing an important tactical advantage.
The success of the submarine is inextricably linked to the development of the torpedo, invented by Robert Whitehead in 1866.
His invention (essentially the same now as it was 140 years ago), allowed the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war.
Prior to the development and miniaturization of sonar sensitive enough to track a submerged submarine, attacks were exclusively restricted to ships and submarines operating near or at the surface.
Targeting of unguided torpedoes was initially done by eye, but by World War II analog targeting computers began to proliferate, being able to calculate basic firing solutions.
Nonetheless, multiple "straight-running" torpedoes could be required to ensure a target was hit.
With at most 20 to 25 torpedoes stored on board, the number of attacks a submarine could make was limited.
To increase combat endurance starting in World War I submarines also functioned as submersible gunboats, using their deck guns against unarmed targets, and diving to escape and engage enemy warships.
The initial importance of these deck guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful Submarine Cruiser such as the French Surcouf and the Royal Navy's X1 and M-class submarines.
With the arrival of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, guns became more for defense than attack.
A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube, loaded only in port.
The ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as minelayers.
Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose.
Modern submarine-laid mines, such as the British Mark 5 Stonefish and Mark 6 Sea Urchin, can be deployed from a submarine's torpedo tubes.
After World War II, both the US and the USSR experimented with submarine-launched cruise missiles such as the SSM-N-8 Regulus and P-5 Pyatyorka.
Such missiles required the submarine to surface to fire its missiles.
They were the forerunners of modern submarine-launched cruise missiles, which can be fired from the torpedo tubes of submerged submarines, for example, the US BGM-109 Tomahawk and Russian RPK-2 Viyuga and versions of surface-to-surface anti-ship missiles such as the Exocet and Harpoon, encapsulated for submarine launch.
Ballistic missiles can also be fired from a submarine's torpedo tubes, for example, missiles such as the anti-submarine SUBROC.
With internal volume as limited as ever and the desire to carry heavier warloads, the idea of the external launch tube was revived, usually for encapsulated missiles, with such tubes being placed between the internal pressure and outer streamlined hulls.
Guided torpedoes also proliferated extensively during and after World War II, even further increasing the combat endurance and lethality of submarines and allowing them to engage other submarines at depth (with the latter now being one of the primary missions of the modern attack submarine).
The strategic mission of the SSM-N-8 and the P-5 was taken up by submarine-launched ballistic missile beginning with the US Navy's Polaris missile, and subsequently the Poseidon and Trident missiles.
Germany is working on the torpedo tube-launched short-range IDAS missile, which can be used against ASW helicopters, as well as surface ships and coastal targets.
A submarine can have a variety of sensors, depending on its missions.
Modern military submarines rely almost entirely on a suite of passive and active sonars to locate targets.
Active sonar relies on an audible "ping" to generate echoes to reveal objects around the submarine.
Active systems are rarely used, as doing so reveals the sub's presence.
Passive sonar is a set of sensitive hydrophones set into the hull or trailed in a towed array, normally trailing several hundred feet behind the sub.
The towed array is the mainstay of NATO submarine detection systems, as it reduces the flow noise heard by operators.
Hull mounted sonar is employed in addition to the towed array, as the towed array can not work in shallow depth and during maneuvering.
In addition, sonar has a blind spot "through" the submarine, so a system on both the front and back works to eliminate that problem.
As the towed array trails behind and below the submarine, it also allows the submarine to have a system both above and below the thermocline at the proper depth; sound passing through the thermocline is distorted resulting in a lower detection range.
Submarines also carry radar equipment to detect surface ships and aircraft.
Submarine captains are more likely to use radar detection gear than active radar to detect targets, as radar can be detected far beyond its own return range, revealing the submarine.
Periscopes are rarely used, except for position fixes and to verify a contact's identity.
Civilian submarines, such as the DSV Alvin or the Russian Mir submersibles, rely on small active sonar sets and viewing ports to navigate.
The human eye cannot detect sunlight below about 300 feet (91 m) underwater, so high intensity lights are used to illuminate the viewing area.
Early submarines had few navigation aids, but modern subs have a variety of navigation systems.
Modern military submarines use an inertial guidance system for navigation while submerged, but drift error unavoidably builds over time.
To counter this, the crew occasionally uses the Global Positioning System to obtain an accurate position.
The periscope—a retractable tube with a prism system that provides a view of the surface—is only used occasionally in modern submarines, since the visibility range is short.
The Virginia-class and Astute-class submarines use photonics masts rather than hull-penetrating optical periscopes.
These masts must still be deployed above the surface, and use electronic sensors for visible light, infrared, laser range-finding, and electromagnetic surveillance.
One benefit to hoisting the mast above the surface is that while the mast is above the water the entire sub is still below the water and is much harder to detect visually or by radar.
Military submarines use several systems to communicate with distant command centers or other ships.
One is VLF (very low frequency) radio, which can reach a submarine either on the surface or submerged to a fairly shallow depth, usually less than 250 feet (76 m).
ELF (extremely low frequency) can reach a submarine at greater depths, but has a very low bandwidth and is generally used to call a submerged sub to a shallower depth where VLF signals can reach.
A submarine also has the option of floating a long, buoyant wire antenna to a shallower depth, allowing VLF transmissions by a deeply submerged boat.
By extending a radio mast, a submarine can also use a "burst transmission" technique.
A burst transmission takes only a fraction of a second, minimizing a submarine's risk of detection.
To communicate with other submarines, a system known as Gertrude is used.
Gertrude is basically a sonar telephone.
Voice communication from one submarine is transmitted by low power speakers into the water, where it is detected by passive sonars on the receiving submarine.
The range of this system is probably very short, and using it radiates sound into the water, which can be heard by the enemy.
Civilian submarines can use similar, albeit less powerful systems to communicate with support ships or other submersibles in the area.
With nuclear power or air-independent propulsion, submarines can remain submerged for months at a time.
Conventional diesel submarines must periodically resurface or run on snorkel to recharge their batteries.
Most modern military submarines generate breathing oxygen by electrolysis of fresh water (using a device called an "Electrolytic Oxygen Generator").
Emergency oxygen can be produced by burning sodium chlorate candles.
Atmosphere control equipment includes a Carbon dioxide scrubber, which uses a spray of monoethanolamine (MEA) absorbent to remove the gas from the air, after which the MEA is heated in a boiler to release the CO2 which is then pumped overboard.
Emergency scrubbing can also be done with lithium hydroxide, which is consumable.
A machine that uses a catalyst to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide (removed by the CO2 scrubber) and bonds hydrogen produced from the ship's storage battery with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce water, is also used.
An atmosphere monitoring system samples the air from different areas of the ship for nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, R-12 and R-114 refrigerants, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other gases.
Poisonous gases are removed, and oxygen is replenished by use of an oxygen bank located in a main ballast tank.
Some heavier submarines have two oxygen bleed stations (forward and aft).
The oxygen in the air is sometimes kept a few percent less than atmospheric concentration to reduce fire risk.
Fresh water is produced by either an evaporator or a reverse osmosis unit.
The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants.
It is also available for showers, sinks, cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met.
Seawater is used to flush toilets, and the resulting "blackwater" is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special sanitary pump.
The blackwater-discharge system requires skill to operate, and isolation valves must be closed before discharge.
The German Type VIIC boat U-1206 was lost with casualties because of human error while using this system.
Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in "grey water" tanks and discharged overboard using drain pumps.
Trash on modern large submarines is usually disposed of using a tube called a Trash Disposal Unit (TDU), where it is compacted into a galvanized steel can.
At the bottom of the TDU is a large ball valve.
An ice plug is set on top of the ball valve to protect it, the cans atop the ice plug.
The top breech door is shut, and the TDU is flooded and equalized with sea pressure, the ball valve is opened and the cans fall out assisted by scrap iron weights in the cans.
The TDU is also flushed with seawater to ensure it is completely empty and the ball valve is clear before closing the valve.
A typical nuclear submarine has a crew of over 80; conventional boats typically have fewer than 40.
The conditions on a submarine can be difficult because crew members must work in isolation for long periods of time, without family contact, and in cramped conditions.
Submarines normally maintain radio silence to avoid detection.
Operating a submarine is dangerous, even in peacetime, and many submarines have been lost in accidents.
Most navies prohibited women from serving on submarines, even after they had been permitted to serve on surface warships.
The Royal Norwegian Navy became the first navy to allow women on its submarine crews in 1985.
The Royal Danish Navy allowed female submariners in 1988.
Others followed suit including the Swedish Navy (1989), the Royal Australian Navy (1998), the Spanish Navy (1999), the German Navy (2001) and the Canadian Navy (2002).
In 1995, Solveig Krey of the Royal Norwegian Navy became the first female officer to assume command on a military submarine, HNoMS Kobben.
On 8 December 2011, British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced that the UK's ban on women in submarines was to be lifted from 2013.
Previously there were fears that women were more at risk from a build-up of carbon dioxide in the submarine.
But a study showed no medical reason to exclude women, though pregnant women would still be excluded.
Similar dangers to the pregnant woman and her fetus barred women from submarine service in Sweden in 1983, when all other positions were made available for them in the Swedish Navy.
Today, pregnant women are still not allowed to serve on submarines in Sweden.
However, the policymakers thought that it was discriminatory with a general ban and demanded that women should be tried on their individual merits and have their suitability evaluated and compared to other candidates.
Further, they noted that a woman complying with such high demands is unlikely to become pregnant.
In May 2014, three women became the RN's first female submariners.
Women have served on US Navy surface ships since 1993, and as of 2011–2012, began serving on submarines for the first time.
Until presently, the Navy allowed only three exceptions to women being on board military submarines: female civilian technicians for a few days at most, women midshipmen on an overnight during summer training for Navy ROTC and Naval Academy, and family members for one-day dependent cruises.
In 2009, senior officials, including then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Joint Chief of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, began the process of finding a way to implement women on submarines.
The US Navy rescinded its "no women on subs" policy in 2010.
Both the US and British navies operate nuclear-powered submarines that deploy for periods of six months or longer.
Other navies that permit women to serve on submarines operate conventionally powered submarines, which deploy for much shorter periods—usually only for a few months.
Prior to the change by the US, no nation using nuclear submarines permitted women to serve on board.
In 2011, the first class of female submarine officers graduated from Naval Submarine School's Submarine Officer Basic Course (SOBC) at the Naval Submarine Base New London.
Additionally, more senior ranking and experienced female supply officers from the surface warfare specialty attended SOBC as well, proceeding to fleet Ballistic Missile (SSBN) and Guided Missile (SSGN) submarines along with the new female submarine line officers beginning in late 2011.
By late 2011, several women were assigned to the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine USS Wyoming.
On 15 October 2013, the US Navy announced that two of the smaller Virginia-class attack submarines, USS Virginia and USS Minnesota, would have female crew-members by January 2015.
In 2020, Japan's national naval submarine academy accepted its first female candidate.
In an emergency, submarines can contact other ships to assist in rescue, and pick up the crew when they abandon ship.
The crew can use escape sets such as the Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment to abandon the submarine via an escape trunk, which is a small airlock compartment that provides a route for crew to escape from a downed submarine at ambient pressure in small groups, while minimising the amount of water admitted to the submarine.
The crew can avoid lung injury from over-expansion of air in the lungs due to the pressure change known as pulmonary barotrauma by maintaining an open airway and exhaling during the ascent.
Following escape from a pressurized submarine, in which the air pressure is higher than atmospheric due to water ingress or other reasons, the crew is at risk of developing decompression sickness on return to surface pressure.
An alternative escape means is via a deep-submergence rescue vehicle that can dock onto the disabled submarine, establish a seal around the escape hatch, and transfer personnel at the same pressure as the interior of the submarine.
If the submarine has been pressurised the survivors can lock into a decompression chamber on the submarine rescue ship and transfer under pressure for safe surface decompression.
Suzuki Motor Corporation (Japanese: スズキ株式会社, Hepburn: Suzuki Kabushiki gaisha) is a Japanese multinational mobility manufacturer headquartered in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka.
It manufactures automobiles, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), outboard marine engines, wheelchairs and a variety of other small internal combustion engines.
In 2016, Suzuki was the eleventh biggest automaker by production worldwide.
Suzuki has over 45,000 employees and has 35 production facilities in 23 countries, and 133 distributors in 192 countries.
The worldwide sales volume of automobiles is the world's tenth largest, while domestic sales volume is the third largest in the country.
Suzuki's domestic motorcycle sales volume is the third largest in Japan.
In 1909, Michio Suzuki (1887–1982) founded the Suzuki Loom Works in the small seacoast village of Hamamatsu, Japan.
Business boomed as Suzuki built weaving looms for Japan's giant silk industry.
In 1929, Michio Suzuki invented a new type of weaving machine, which was exported overseas.
The company's first 30 years focused on the development and production of these machines.
Despite the success of his looms, Suzuki believed that his company would benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products.
Based on consumer demand, he decided that building a small car would be the most practical new venture.
The project began in 1937, and within two years Suzuki had completed several compact prototype cars.
These first Suzuki motor vehicles were powered by a then-innovative, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-cylinder engine.
It had a cast aluminum crankcase and gearbox and generated 13 horsepower (9.7 kW) from a displacement of less than 800cc.
With the onset of World War II, production plans for Suzuki's new vehicles were halted when the government declared civilian passenger cars a "non-essential commodity."
At the conclusion of the war, Suzuki went back to producing looms.
Loom production was given a boost when the U.S. government approved the shipping of cotton to Japan.
Suzuki's fortunes brightened as orders began to increase from domestic textile manufacturers.
But the joy was short-lived as the cotton market collapsed in 1951.
Faced with this colossal challenge, Suzuki returned to the production of motor vehicles.
After the war, the Japanese had a great need for affordable, reliable personal transportation.
A number of firms began offering "clip-on" gas-powered engines that could be attached to the typical bicycle.
Suzuki's first two-wheeled vehicle was a bicycle fitted with a motor called, the "Power Free."
Designed to be inexpensive and simple to build and maintain, the 1952 Power Free had a 36 cc, one horsepower, two-stroke engine.
The new double-sprocket gear system enabled the rider to either pedal with the engine assisting, pedal without engine assist, or simply disconnect the pedals and run on engine power alone.
The patent office of the new democratic government granted Suzuki a financial subsidy to continue research in motorcycle engineering.
By 1954, Suzuki was producing 6,000 motorcycles per month and his company had officially changed its name to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd.
Following the success of his first motorcycles, Suzuki created an even more successful automobile: the 1955 Suzuki Suzulight.
The Suzulight sold with front-wheel drive, four-wheel independent suspension and rack-and-pinion steering, which were not common on cars until three decades later.
Volkswagen held a 19.9% non-controlling shareholding in Suzuki between 2009 and 2015.
This situation did not last, as Suzuki accused Volkswagen of not sharing promised technology while Volkswagen objected to a deal where Suzuki purchased diesel engines from Fiat.
An international arbitration court ordered Volkswagen to sell the stake back to Suzuki.
Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete the stock buy-back in September 2015.
The company was founded by Michio Suzuki; its current Chairman is Osamu Suzuki, the fourth adopted son-in-law in a row to run the company, Osamu Suzuki, the 91 year old Chairman of Suzuki Motor Corporation, will retire in June 2021, handing over to his son Toshihiro.
The Suzuki Loom Company started in 1909 as a manufacturer of looms for weaving silk and cotton.
Michio Suzuki was intent on making better, more user-friendly looms and, for 30 years his focus was on the development of these machines.
Michio's desire to diversify into automotive products was interrupted by World War II.
Before it began building four-stroke engines, Suzuki Motor Corp. was known for its two-stroke engines (for motorcycles and autos).
After the war, Suzuki made a two-stroke motorized bicycle, but eventually the company would be known for Hayabusa and GSX-R motorcycles, for the QuadRunner, and for dominating racetracks around the world.
Even after producing its first car in 1955 the company didn't have an automobile division until 1961.
Today Suzuki is among the world's largest automakers, and a major brand name in important markets, including Japan and India, but no longer sells cars in North America.
Michio Suzuki founds Suzuki Loom Works founded in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. 1920: Company is reorganized, incorporated, and capitalized at ¥500,000 as Suzuki Loom Manufacturing Co. with Michio Suzuki as president.
Suzuki begins a project to diversify into manufacturing small cars.
Within two years several innovative prototypes are completed, but the government declares civilian passenger cars a "non-essential commodity" at the onset of World War II, thwarting production plans.

The Suzuki Motor Corporation owns 54.2% of Maruti Suzuki and the rest is owned by various Indian public and financial institutions.
The company was incorporated in 1981 and is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India.

Over the years, the product range has widened and ownership has changed hands as the customer has evolved.
Maruti Suzuki offers models ranging from the Maruti 800 to the premium sedan Maruti Suzuki Kizashi and luxury SUV Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara.
Maruti 800 was the first model launched by the company in 1983 followed by mini-van Maruti Omni in 1984.

The company went on to launch another compact car Maruti Wagon-R followed by Maruti Baleno in 1999.

American Suzuki Motor Corp.
American Suzuki headquarters is in Brea, California.
The company announced in November 2012 that it would stop selling cars in the United States.
Through an agreement with General Motors, Suzuki began selling a version of their Suzuki Cultus in the United States as the Chevrolet Sprint in 1985.
This model was initially sold as a 3-door hatchback and would be Chevrolet's smallest model.
The Samurai was also introduced in 1985 for the 1986 model year and was the first car introduced to the United States by the newly created American Suzuki Corp.
No other Japanese company sold more cars in the United States in its first year than Suzuki.
The Samurai was available as a convertible or hardtop and the company slogan was Never a Dull Moment.
The Samurai was successful until Consumer Reports alleged the Samurai of being susceptible to roll over in a 1988 test.
This led to a much publicized 1996 lawsuit, not settled until 2004.
In 1989, American Suzuki introduced the Swift which was the 2nd generation Suzuki Cultus.
The Swift was available as a GTi and GLX hatchback with a 4-door sedan following in 1990.
A new small SUV called the Sidekick was also introduced in 1989.
1991 saw the introduction of the 4-door Suzuki Sidekick, the first 4-door mini-SUV in North America.
The Swift and Sidekick were cousins to GM's Geo Metro and Geo Tracker and were mostly produced in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada by Suzuki and GM's joint venture, CAMI.
The Swift GT/GTi and 4-door models were imported from Japan.
Negative evaluations from Consumer Reports of the Suzuki Samurai led to some temporary setbacks at American Suzuki as annual sales in the following years dropped to below 20,000 units.
In 1995, American Suzuki introduced the Esteem and redesigned the Swift.
The Swift GT was dropped and this version Swift was specific only to North America where it was built at CAMI.
These models were the first Suzuki vehicles to be marketed in North America with dual front airbags.
A station wagon version of the Esteem was introduced in 1996.
Worldwide Suzuki production reached more than 975,000 cars this year.
Also in 1996, American Suzuki released the 2-door SUV X-90 and a revised Sidekick Sport model with dual airbags, a 95 hp (71 kW) 1.6 liter engine, 15 inch wheels.
The Sidekick was replaced by the Vitara and the Grand Vitara for 1999.
The Grand Vitara would be Suzuki's first model with a V6-cylinder engine and available 4-wheel ABS brakes.
The XL-7 was introduced in 1998 as a stretched version of the Grand Vitara.
The XL-7 had a larger 2.7 liter V6-cylinder engine and 3-row seating.
This would be Suzuki's largest vehicle to date.
The Swift was dropped from the model lineup in 2001 and the Esteem was replaced in 2002 by the new Aerio, which was offered as a 4-door sedan and 5-door crossover with 4-wheel drive as an option.
In 2004, General Motors and Suzuki jointly purchased the bankrupt Daewoo Motors renaming the venture GMDAT.
American Suzuki rebadged the compact Daewoo Nubira/Daewoo Lacetti as the Forenza and the mid-size Daewoo Magnus as the Verona.
The Forenza gained station wagon and hatchback body style in 2005, with the hatchback sold under the Reno name.
2006 was the first year American Suzuki sold more than 100,000 vehicles in the United States.
Suzuki redesigned the Grand Vitara in 2006 as well as introduced the all-new SX4 and XL7 in 2007.
The Suzuki SX4 is produced as a joint venture with Fiat and the XL7 (notice the shortening of the name from Grand Vitara XL-7) was produced as a joint venture with GM at CAMI Automotive Inc. in Ingersoll.
Suzuki put XL7 production on indefinite hiatus in mid-2009 due to low demand and subsequently sold off its share of CAMI back to GM later that year.
Despite a difficult domestic US automarket, Suzuki kept pace with its 2007 sales numbers in 2008.
In 2009 however, Suzuki sales dropped 48.5%, following a 17% sales drop in 2008.
Suzuki did not import any 2010 model year street motorcycles into the US, with dealers instead relying on unsold stock from the 2009 model year.
New street motorcycle models to the US resumed for the 2011 model year.
In November 2012, Suzuki announced that its US division would file for bankruptcy and would stop selling automobiles in the United States.
It plans to continue to sell motorcycles, ATVs, and marine products in the US.

It is fitted with a 1,300 cm3 (79 cu in) engine taken from the GSX1300R Hayabusa motorcycle in an attempt to split the difference, merging the posture of an automobile and the disposition of a sportbike (Suzuki had been particularly successful selling motorcycles in the United States).
Its high-revving inline-four engine supplied about 175 hp to a bare-bones, two-seat roadster weighing less than 1500 pounds.
Pixy + SSC concept was introduced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show.
The Pixy is an enclosed three-wheel, single-seat personal transport pod, similar to the Toyota i-unit, and i-REAL, but dissimilar in that two Pixies can dock inside the SSC (aka Suzuki Sharing Coach) for highway driving.
Electric power is generated by a hydrogen fuel cell and solar panels to drive the SSC carrier van, and to recharge the Pixy at the same time.
Hayabusa Sport was a sports car unveiled at the 2002 Tokyo Auto Salon.
Its engine - the same 1.3l I4 as found in the GSXR/4 and the GSXR-1300R Hayabusa sports bike it was named after - would produce 175hp at 9800rpm and was mated to a 6-speed sequential gearbox.
Due to characteristics such as its front-mid engine positioning and diminutive carbon-fibre body, Suzuki achieved an optimal front:rear weight distribution of 50:50 and a markedly low mass of 550kg.
One prototype was created and, while conceived as a street-legal car, was not ever used on the road.
X-HEAD is a concept vehicle that debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Auto Show.
It has a somewhat unusual design, looking similar to a dump truck.
It has an X pattern on its tires, but the X in its name is attributed to its multipurpose capability.
Suzuki Concept X debuted at the 2005 North American International Auto Show as a significant departure in styling for a Suzuki mid-sized sport utility vehicle aimed at younger buyers in the North American market.
This concept vehicle evolved into the second-generation XL7 introduced late in 2006.
G70 appeared at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show as the Regina, but was renamed before the 2012 Salon International de l'Auto and Auto China shows to signify that it met the goal of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions no higher than 70g/km (and perhaps that Regina as a model name would be a marketing fiasco).
The G70 is a concept for the next-generation global compact car, possibly replacing the Alto, and at 3,550 millimetres (140 in) long and 1,630 mm (64 in) wide with a weight of 730 kilograms (1,610 lb), the G70 is smaller and lighter than the Alto.
It has an extremely economical 800 cubic centimetres (49 cu in), direct-injection turbo gasoline engine mated to a continuously variable transmission, and a claimed fuel mileage of 3.1 litres per 100 kilometres (91 mpg‑imp; 76 mpg‑US).
Q-concept, first shown at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show, is a bubble car like the MIT CityCar, Nissan Pivo or Toyota PM.
Just 2,500 millimetres (98 in) in length, the Q-concept has its driver and one passenger riding in tandem but is more comfortable than a motorcycle, being enclosed and having seats instead of a saddle.
Intended primarily for short trips (within 10 kilometres (6.2 mi))
it ought to be able to park in nearly any available space.
Suzuki unveiled the iK-2 concept at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show.
Suzuki showed the 4x4 mini SUV concept iM-4 concept at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015.
Suzuki started manufacturing motorcycles in 1952, the first models being motorized bicycles.
From 1955 to 1976 the company manufactured motorcycles with two-stroke engines only, the biggest two-stroke model being the water-cooled triple-cylinder G2F5.
A large factor in Suzuki's success in two-stroke competition was the East German Grand Prix racer Ernst Degner, who defected to the West in 1961, bringing with him expertise in two-stroke engines from the East German manufacturer MZ.
The secrets Degner brought with him were three crucial technologies: the boost port, the expansion chamber, and the rotary valve.
Walter Kaaden of MZ was the first engineer to combine these three crucial technologies.
Suzuki hired Degner, and he won the 50 cc class FIM road racing World Championship for them in the 1962 season.
Suzuki became the first Japanese manufacturer to win a motocross world championship when Joel Robert won the 1970 250 cc title.
In the 1970s, Suzuki established themselves in the motorcycle racing world with Barry Sheene Marco Lucchinelli1981 Franco Uncini1982 winning world championships in the premier 500cc class.
In 1976 Suzuki introduced its first motorcycles since the Colleda COX of the 1950s with four-stroke engines, the GS400 and GS750.
In 1994, Suzuki partnered with Nanjing Jincheng Machinery to create a Chinese motorcycle manufacturer and exporter called Jincheng Suzuki.
Suzuki continued to compete in MotoGP and last won the title in the 2000 season.
From 2006 to 2011, the team was sponsored by Rizla and was known as Rizla Suzuki MotoGP team.
On 18 November 2011, Suzuki announced that the GP racing was suspended, partly due to natural disasters and recession, until 2014.
Suzuki returned to MotoGP in 2015.
The next few years in MotoGP were rather experimental for Suzuki, with some spotty success; but in 2020, on Suzuki's 100th anniversary, Spanish rider Joan Mir surprised the world by cinching the 2020 MotoGP World Championship, Suzuki's first GP conquest since Kenny Roberts Jr's World Championship win in 2000.
In addition Suzuki have recorded a total of 94 victories at the Isle of Man TT Races.
Suzuki have also taken the runner up spot in the various race categories 100 times and a total 92 third places.
X6 Hustler twin (aka T20 Super Six) was sold from 1966 to 1968 as "the fastest 250cc motorcycle in the world".
It had Suzuki's new Posi-Force automatic oil injection system (later called Suzuki CCI).
Production peaked at more than 5000 units per month.
In 2013, Suzuki renewed the Hustler motorcycle trademark for Europe, leading to rumors of a retro style 250 twin.
A 1967 T20 Super Six was included in the Las Vegas show of The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition.
T500 Titan (aka T500 Cobra, GT500) had a 500 cc air-cooled parallel-twin engine which overcame problems with durability, overheating and vibration.
With an output of 47 metric horsepower (35 kW) at 6,500 rpm and top speed of 180 kilometres per hour (110 mph), it became Suzuki's flagship machine in 1968, and remains popular with collectors and café racers.
GT750 Le Mans with a straight-three engine was the first Japanese motorcycle with a liquid-cooled engine, earning it the moniker "Water Buffalo."
The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan (in Japanese) includes the 1971 Suzuki GT750 as one of their 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.
TM400 Cyclone production motocrosser was designed to participate in 500cc class Motocross World Championship racing.
Introduced in 1971, it was notoriously difficult even for skilled riders to control.
Redesigned in 1975.
The RM125 production motocrosser debuted in 1975 to replace the TM125.
It was a successful forerunner of the future RM series line-up from 50cc to 500cc.
RM250 was fully redesigned in 1982 and the liquid-cooled single-cylinder delivered more power than any production 250cc motorcrosser of the time.
It had Suzuki's original full floater, link-type rear suspension introduced a year earlier.
RG250 Gamma of 1983 was one of the new generation of race replica sport bikes of the 1980s.
It had an aluminum frame, a full fairing and a high output straight-twin engine.
The 1983 RG250Γ is one of the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.
RG500 Gamma of 1985 was like RG250, but with a square-four engine.
RGV250 Gamma, the road-racing replica of Kevin Schwantz's RGV500 GP race bike, replaced the RG250 in 1988 with a V-twin engine.
GS series – The 1976 GS750 was the first 4-stroke machine released by Suzuki in 20 years.
The following year saw Suzuki's first 1-liter machine, the GS1000E, and then in 1979 the GS1000S copy of a Yoshimura GS1000 Superbike.
Katana – The GSX1100S was released in Europe in 1980; the GSX1000S arrived in the U.S. and Canada later that year as a 1981 model, and revolutionized sportbike styling.
A 1982 Katana GS1000SV is on the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame's list of "classic bikes" that have been shown in the museum, and was in The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition.
GSX-R750 was one of the Japanese sport bikes of the 1980s that began the modern race replica era.
It had air/oil cooling, light weight, and a powerful engine.
The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan (in Japanese) includes the 1984 Suzuki GSX-R750 as one of their 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology, and was in The Art of the Motorcycle.
Intruder 750 with its OHC 4-valve 45° V-twin engine was the first Japanese cruiser motorcycle (designed to appeal to U.S. riders) in 1985.
By 1997, cruiser-style motorcycles would account for nearly 60 percent of the U.S. street-bike market.
GSX-R1100, related to the GSX-R750, appeared in 1986.
The same basic engine would reappear in 1995 to power the Bandit 1200 and remain in production through 2006.
Suzuki GSF1200 Bandit - Released in 1996 after the fully-faired RF900, the big, GSXR-powered Bandit offered stunning performance with real-world ergonomics and capabilities, and has become something of a "cult" model.
These units have been used widely from road-race to Open Road Touring, were renowned for their versatility, robustness and massive torque production.
Many are still in operation.
The carbureted, air (and oil)-cooled design ran from 1996 to 2002; afterward Suzuki moved into fuel injection and liquid cooling on subsequent models.
The last of the series was the GSX1250Fa.
Though not technically labeled as a "Bandit", it was obviously the last in the long, popular line.
Black, with a full-fairing, the GSX/Fa sold for only two years, between 2010 and 2011.
Critics praised the model, like the earlier GSF, for its ergonomics and practical, "Do-It-All" capabilities; but market desire sagged due to the final model's heavy weight and relatively low power output.
The DR-BIG aka Desert Express DR800S (in German) off-roader was existent for two model years as the DR750S (in German) until 1990, when its displacement increased to 779cc, still the world largest single cylinder engine in a production motorcycle.
Available in Europe through 1999, it was not exported to the U.S. market.
Replaced by the V-Strom twin, the DR-BIG has now come full circle as the design inspiration for a 2014 overhaul of the V-Strom 1000 ABS.
As of 2020, the DR-BIG acted as the inspiration of the revisioned Suzuki V-Strom 1050.
Suzuki RF Series The Suzuki RF series are sport touring motorcycles.
They came with three engine variations: 400, 600 and 900 cc.
It was in production from 1994 to 1998.
TL1000S debuted at the 1996 International Motorcycle and Scooter Show as the first Suzuki sport bike with a V-twin engine.
This was a liquid-cooled, 90° V-twin, DOHC engine with 4 valves per cylinder, which would be in production through 2012.
Although the TL1000S motorcycle ceased production in 2001, the engine would carry on in the TL1000R, the SV1000 and SV1000S, as well as the V-Strom 1000 and the Suzuki V-Strom 1050.
GSX-R600 – a smaller version of the GSX-R750.
There were earlier pretenders, but the genuine article arrived in 1997 and has received frequent updates after that.
Hayabusa (GSX-1300R) was introduced in 1998, and remains Suzuki's flagship sport bike.
The 1998 Suzuki Hayabusa is included in the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.
The development of a second generation Hayabusa for the 2008 model year facilitated the 2007 roll-out of the GSX-1300BK B-King, a highly stylized naked variant.
SV650 was introduced in 1999 as a budget entry in the naked bike market, and since 2001, offered both naked and fully faired.
In 2009 the naked bike version was redesigned and renamed the Gladius in keeping with the sword motif Suzuki established with the Katana.
The Gladius motorcycle won a Good Design Award (aka G Mark) from the Japan Institute of Design Promotion.
GSX-R1000 – This top-of-the-line superbike debuted in 2000, and remains the largest model of the GSX-R series.
Burgman 650 (AN650) was the largest of a series of urban scooters produced in Japan (marketed as Skywave domestically) as well as in Italy and Spain with engine capacities of 125cc and up.
When it appeared in 2002 the 650 was the largest-displacement scooter in the world, and first two-wheel vehicle to have an electrically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission.
The Japan Institute of Design Promotion awarded the G Mark Good Design Award to the Skywave 650 in 2003, to the entire Skywave series in 2006 and to the updated Skywave 650LX in 2013.
Choinori was a lightweight, inexpensive, 50cc scooter and the antithesis of the Skywave 650, but they were introduced at the same time in an effort to increase domestic sales in response to shrinking motorcycle exports.
The 2002 Choinori is one of the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.
The Choinori was awarded the G Mark Good Design Award in 2003.
Boulevard M109R (VZR1800) V-twin, dubbed the Intruder M1800R in Europe, arrived in 2006 boasting a 112 mm (4.4 in) bore with a 90.5 mm (3.56 in) stroke, amongst the largest gasoline engine pistons ever used in any production motorcycle (or passenger car).
GSX-650F – introduced in 2008, this new sport touring model fills the void of the retired Katana.
The 2009 model has ABS standard.
Across – a small 250 cc engine sport touring motorcycle produced from 1990 until 1998.
It is mostly known as a practical sports/touring bike, due to its rear petrol tank and a fully enclosed helmet storage area where the petrol tank usually is.
Suzuki GSX-R250 – a motorcycle that was manufactured from 1987 to 1994.
A couple of years after the presentation of the GSX-R750 the 250 cc GSX-R250 was released.
Like the larger bike, the GSX-R250 had a box-frame (steel, not aluminum), full fairing, full-floater rear swing and a four-cylinder four-stroke engine.
But while the GSX-R750 engine was air and oil-cooled, the baby brother had a liquid-cooled engine.
Not many examples are seen outside Japan.
17-inch cast wheels and 300 mm twin disc brake at the front.
The GSX-R250 had impressive power and was made primarily as a road legal 250 cc racing bike reaching speeds of 200+km/h (124 mph).
Imported specimens may be seen in Australia and New Zealand commonly.
Also, around 350 units were exported to Denmark around 1989 to 1992.
Starting in 2017, the engine continued in the Suzuki V-Strom 250.
RE5 was the first (and only) Japanese motorcycle produced with a Wankel rotary engine.
That, and its Giugiaro styling, make it one of the oddest and most collectible motorcycles of the 1970s.
The 1974 RE5 is one of the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology, and a 1976 model is in the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame.
Burgman Fuel-Cell Scooter uses electric-motor propulsion, powered by an air-cooled hydrogen fuel cell; its only emission is water.
Following on a concept model at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, in 2011 the Burgman Fuel-Cell Scooter became the world's first fuel-cell vehicle to earn Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA) in the European Union, enabling the vehicle to be sold in all member states.
Suzuki is working toward commercial production of this scooter.
Falcorustyco concept model at the 1985 Tokyo Motor Show envisaged the motorcycle technologies that might be brought into play by 1995, including a 4-cycle square 4-cylinder 500 cc engine, frameless body, front-and-rear swingarm suspension, center hub hydraulic power steering, chainless hydraulic drive and pop-up screen cowling.
Nuda was a full-time two-wheel drive prototype, incorporating power steering and a swing seat, in a carbon fiber honeycomb monocoque body, shown at the 1986 Tokyo Motor Show.
Nuda concepts influenced the design of the Suzuki Hayabusa.
B-King – The concept model was well received by the public when it went on display at the 2001 Tokyo Motor Show.
The addition of a turbocharger to the GSX1300R engine testified to massive power output, while electronics such as cellphone and GPS were stowed in the ultra-modern angular bodywork.
The production model appeared six years later, largely unchanged except for its naturally aspirated engine.
B-King styling is reflected in the award-winning design of the GSR600 and the GSR750, as well as the Inazuma GW250 and GW250S. G-Strider concept model with 916 cc engine, made public at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, was a half-scooter, half-cruiser (motorcycle) mash-up with an electrically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission incorporating a push-button manual mode, similar to the Burgman 650.
Accentuating luxury, the G-Strider's handlebars, footrests, seat backrest, passenger backrest and windscreen were all electrically adjustable while under way to ensure the most comfortable riding position possible.
Stratosphere prototype was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2005, with an 1100 cc engine pushed to the limits of space-saving design, resulting in an in-line six-cylinder as wide as a conventional in-line four-cylinder engine.
Hammered aluminum and Damascus steel incorporate material characteristics into styling design.
Prospects for a production model seemed good, considering that Suzuki's previous significant concept motorcycle, the B-King had made it into production, but the market changed before Stratosphere got the go-ahead.
Biplane was a blue-sky concept announced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, designed to convey the joy of two-wheel mobility, inspired by the feeling of flying an airplane.
Its shape generates a feeling of openness in a modern machine powered by a V-four engine.
Crosscage concept model was displayed at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show.
Combining a high-performance secondary battery and a compact, lightweight air-cooled fuel-cell system from British specialist company Intelligent Energy enabled quick activation with low fuel consumption.
The lithium-ion battery assured reserve power as well as minimal environmental impact.
Light weight not only made this bike environment-friendly but also sporty.
Gemma prototype model was introduced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show.
The distinctive "full-flat 2-seater," 250 cc four-stroke single-cylinder scooter is low and sleek and gives the rider and passenger feel a greater sense of intimacy.
The luggage compartment in front of the rider holds a helmet.
Gemma went into production in Japan the following year for the domestic market.
Recursion turbo parallel-twin middleweight, shown at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show.
Suzuki is a major sponsor of luge, biathlon, and cross-country skiing sporting events.
They were the title sponsor of the 2008 to 2020 edition of the ASEAN Football Championship (as the AFF Suzuki Cup) and have sponsored English League Two club Milton Keynes Dons, Italian Serie A club Torino and Polish Ekstraklasa club Korona Kielce.
Tatra is a Czech vehicle manufacturer from Kopřivnice.
It is owned by the TATRA TRUCKS a.s. company, and it is the third oldest company in the world producing motor vehicles with an unbroken history.
The company was founded in 1850 as Ignatz Schustala & Cie.
In 1890 the company became a joint-stock company and was renamed the Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft.
In 1897, the Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft produced the Präsident, which was the first factory-produced automobile with a petrol engine to be made in Central and Eastern Europe.
The First Truck was made a year later, in 1898.
In 1918, the company was renamed Kopřivnická vozovka a.s., and in 1919 it changed from the Nesselsdorfer marque to the Tatra badge, named after the nearby Tatra Mountains on the Czechoslovak-Polish border (now on the Polish-Slovak border).
In the interwar period, Tatra came to international prominence with its line of affordable cars based on backbone tube chassis and air-cooled engines, starting with Tatra 11 (1923).
The company also became the pioneer of automotive aerodynamics, starting with Tatra 77 (1934).
Following the 1938 German-Czechoslovak war and Munich Agreement, the town of Kopřivnice was occupied by Nazi Germany and Tatra's production was directed towards military production.
Trucks like Tatra 111 (1942) became instrumental both for the German Nazi war effort as well as post-war reconstruction in Central Europe and Soviet Union.
Today, Tatra's production focuses on heavy, off-road trucks based on its century-long development of backbone chassis, swinging half-axles, and air-cooled engines.
The core of its production consists of the Tatra 817, intended primarily for military operators, and the Tatra Phoenix (Tatra chassis with DAF cabin and Paccar water-cooled engine), aimed primarily for the civilian market.
In 2023, the company plans to produce over 2,000 trucks.
In 1850, Ignaz Schustala founded "Ignatz Schustala & Cie" in Kopřivnice, and the company entered the business of manufacturing horse-drawn vehicles.
In the 1880s, the company began manufacturing railroad cars.
In 1890, the company became a joint-stock company, and was renamed the Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft.
Also that year, Hugo Fischer von Röslerstamm became the company's technical director.
After Schustala's death in 1891, von Röslerstamm took over the management of the business.
In 1897, the company began creation of an automobile with an internal combustion engine.
Using a Benz automobile purchased by von Röslerstamm as inspiration, the company built its first car, the Präsident, under the direction of engineers Hans Ledwinka and Edmund Rumpler.
The Präsident was exhibited in Vienna later that year.
The company began taking orders for cars, and between 1897 and 1900, nine improved cars based on the Präsident were made.
The first car to be completely designed by Ledwinka was the Nesselsdorf A, which was produced in 1900.
The Nesselsdorf A was equipped with a rear-mounted 2714 cc engine, and had a top speed of 40 km/h (25 mph).
22 units were built.
The Nesselsdorf A was followed in 1902 by the Type B, which featured a central engine.
Ledwinka then left the company to concentrate on steam engine development.
He returned in 1905, and designed a completely new car, the Type S, which was equipped with a 3308 cc 4-cylinder engine.
In 1912, production was badly affected by a strike that lasted 23 weeks, and von Röslerstamm left the company.
In 1916, Ledwinka left the company again, this time to work for one of its competitors, Steyr-Werke in Graz.
In 1919 the company began using the Tatra brand for its cars.
In 1921 the company was renamed "Kopřivnická vozovka".
That year, the company's director, Leopold Pasching, convinced Ledwinka to return to the company to run its new car plant.
Ledwinka's next design, the Tatra 11, which was released in 1923, featured a rigid backbone tube with swinging semi-axles at the rear giving independent suspension.
The Tatra 11 was fitted with a front-mounted, air-cooled 1056 cc two-cylinder engine.
In 1924 the company was renamed "Závody Tatra".
The Tatra 17, released in 1925, featured a 1930 cc water-cooled six-cylinder engine, and fully independent suspension.
In 1926, the Tatra 11 was succeeded by the Tatra 12, which was similar to the Tatra 11, but was equipped with four-wheel brakes.
In 1927 the company was renamed "Ringhoffer-Tatra".
Tatra's specialty was luxury cars using the most recent technology, going from air-cooled flat-twins to fours and sixes, culminating (briefly) with the OHC 6-litre V12 in 1931.
In the 1930s, under the supervision of Austrian engineer Hans Ledwinka, his son Erich and German engineer Erich Übelacker, and protected by high tariffs and absence of foreign assemblers, Tatra began building advanced, streamlined cars after obtaining licences from Paul Jaray, which started in 1934 with the large Tatra 77, the world's first production aerodynamic car.
The average drag coefficient of a 1:5 model of the fastback Tatra 77 was recorded as 0.2455.
It featured (as did almost all subsequent big Tatras) a rear-mounted, air-cooled V8 engine.
Both Adolf Hitler and Ferdinand Porsche were influenced by the Tatras.
Hitler was a keen automotive enthusiast, and had ridden in Tatras during political tours of Czechoslovakia.
He had also dined numerous times with Ledwinka.
After one of these dinners Hitler remarked to Porsche, "This is the car for my roads".
From 1933 onwards, Ledwinka and Porsche met regularly to discuss their designs, and Porsche admitted "Well, sometimes I looked over his shoulder and sometimes he looked over mine" while designing the Volkswagen.
There is no doubt that the Beetle bore a striking resemblance to the Tatras, particularly the Tatra V570.
The Tatra 97 of 1936 had a rear-located, rear-wheel drive, air-cooled four-cylinder boxer engine accommodating four passengers and providing luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seat.
Another similarity between this Tatra and the Beetle is the central structural tunnel.
Tatra launched a lawsuit against Volkswagen for patent infringement, but this was stopped when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia.
At the same time, Tatra was forced to stop producing the T97.
The matter was re-opened after World War II and in 1965 Volkswagen paid the Ringhoffer family DM 1,000,000 in an out of court settlement.
Tatra and Volkswagen's body design were preceded by similar designs of Hungarian automotive engineer Bela Barenyi, whose sketches resembling the Volkswagen Beetle date back to 1925.
After the 1938 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany, Tatras were kept in production, largely because Germans liked the cars.
Many German officers died in car accidents caused by driving the heavy, rear-engined Tatras faster around corners than they could handle.
At the time, as an anecdote, Tatra became known as the 'Czech Secret Weapon' for the scores of officers who died behind the wheel; at one point official orders were issued forbidding German officers from driving Tatras.
Tatra was instrumental in the production of trucks and tank engines for the German war effort.
The factory was nationalised in 1945 almost three years before the Communist Party came to power and in January 1946 was renamed "Tatra Národní Podnik".
Although production of prewar models continued, a new model, the Tatra 600 Tatraplan was designed—the name celebrating the new Communist planned economy and the aeroplane inspiration (Colloq.
Czech: aeroplán).
It went into production in 1948.
In 1951, the state planning department decided that the Tatraplan should henceforth be built at the Škoda plant in Mladá Boleslav, leaving Tatra free to concentrate on trucks, buses and railway equipment.
In 1953, amid much dissatisfaction among Communist party leaders with the poor-quality official cars imported from Russia, Tatra was again given permission to produce a luxury car, the Tatra 603.
Much like Tatra's prewar cars, it was driven by a rear-mounted, air-cooled V8 and had the company's trademark aerodynamic styling.
The Tatra 603 initially featured three headlights and the first prototypes had a central rear stabilising fin, though this feature was lost on production vehicles.
It was also fitted with almost American-style thick chrome bumpers with bullets (a.k.a. Dagmar bumpers).
Almost entirely hand-built, Tatras were not available for normal citizens as they were not permitted to buy them.
The cars were reserved for the Communist Party elite and industrial officials, as well as being exported to most other communist nations as official state cars.
Notably, Cuban President Fidel Castro had a white Tatra 603, custom-fitted with air conditioning.
Tatra 603s were built until 1975, a twenty-year reign as one of communism's finest cars.
Numerous improvements were made during its production run, although not all vehicles built were actually new but rather reconditioned.
In exchange for a newer model year car, the older vehicle was returned to the factory.
There, it was upgraded to current model year specifications, refinished, and sent out again as a putatively new vehicle to replace another older T603.
This makes it difficult to trace the history of surviving vehicles.
In 1968 a replacement was developed: the Tatra 613.
It was styled by the Italian styling house of Vignale and was a more modern, less rounded shape.
It was not until 1973 that the car went into production, and volume production did not begin until the following year.
Although the layout remained the same, the body was all new, as was the engine, which was equipped with four overhead camshafts, a higher capacity motor (3495 cc) and an output close to 165 bhp (123 kW; 167 PS).
In addition, it had been moved somewhat forward for improved balance.
These cars were built in five series and went through several modifications until production ceased in 1996.
Over 11,000 cars were built, and sales slowed to a trickle of just a few dozen per year towards the end of production as Tatras began to seem more and more outdated.
The Tatra 700 was a large luxury car released in 1996 by Tatra.
It was essentially a heavily restyled version of the Tatra 613 model it replaced, with updated body panels and detailing.
The T700 was offered as both a saloon and coupé with either a 3.5 or 4.4 litre 90° air-cooled V8 petrol engine.
The model was neither successful nor produced in large numbers, with a total of 69–72 cars manufactured.
The T700 was the last passenger car made by Tatra with production halting in 1999.
At this point, Tatra abandoned automobile manufacturing in order to concentrate on truck design and manufacture.
The Tatra MTX V8 was the fastest Czech car of all time.
Production started in 1991 in Kopřivnice.
It has a Tatra 623 V8 engine with inlet manifold injection producing 225 kW at 6500 rpm.
It accelerates from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 5.6 seconds.
The top speed is 265 kilometres per hour (165 mph).
The Czech designer Václav Král designed this vehicle, with only five ever produced.
In February 2008, Tatra announced the world's first and only air-cooled engine meeting the then forthcoming Euro 5 emissions standards.
The press release claims 7.5 times lower emissions of particulates and 3.5 times lower emission of nitrogen oxides compared to the previous engine.
Further, production of air-cooled engines should significantly reduce the production of greenhouse gases due to the absence of liquid cooling systems.
All Tatra vehicles from February 2008 onwards should use the new engine.
A month later, Tatra CEO Ronald Adams told The Prague Post Tatra could return to producing passenger cars, saying: "We would not come back to compete with the large automobile mass producers such as Volkswagen, Škoda, Toyota etc.
But we might come back with a replica of the old Tatra cars using a current undercarriage and driveline from one of the major automotive producers."
The company has launched a feasibility study, hoping to produce one thousand replicas of their legendary Tatraplan and 603 cars in 2010.
In July 2008 pictures of a fuel cell concept car designed by Mike Jelinek, the Tatra 903, were shown.
Unlike most Eastern Bloc manufacturers, Tatra enjoyed modest sales success in Western Europe, where its truck line had a reputation for simplicity and durability.
No effort was made to distribute Tatra's unusual automobiles in the West, though a small number did find their way to collectors in Western Europe, and even to the United States.
The end of the Cold War did not help Tatra's fortunes, as the company made no inroads in Western Europe's already crowded automobile market.
The introduction of competitors, such as Mercedes-Benz and Peugeot into the Czech Republic, further eroded Tatra's sales.
Production of passenger cars ended in 1999.
Among Western collectors, Tatra automobiles remain largely unknown.
The largest display of Tatra vehicles in the United States is at the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, Tennessee.
The museum's eclectic automobile collection contains 12 Tatra models, including a T-613 ambulance.
When talk show host and car collector Jay Leno visited the museum, the founder picked him up in a 1947 Tatra 87, prompting Leno to purchase one himself.
Leno soon became an advocate for the brand.
In the United States, the few Tatra clubs are closely associated with Citroën clubs, as many Tatra collectors also collect Citroën DS series cars.
A Tatra 87 is on exhibit at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.
The first truck manufactured at Kopřivnice in 1898 was a flatbed with two liquid-cooled side-by-side-mounted two-cylinder Benz engines each at 2.7 L capacity with total power output of 8.8 kW (12 hp) placed after the rear axle and cargo capacity of 2.5 ton.
The unique feature of the engines setup was that the engines could be operated sequentially depending on the load requirements.
No 1 engine was started via a cranking handle and had a flywheel attached and No 2 engine without the flywheel was connected via a gear clutch and started by the first engine already running.
The second truck manufactured was once again a flatbed R type of 2.5 ton cargo capacity built in 1909.
Powered by liquid-cooled petrol four-cylinder engine of 4.1 L capacity and power output of 18.4 kW (25 hp) with the engine placed above front axle which is the conventional design to this day.
The vehicle featured solid rubber tyres and semi-elliptic leaf spring suspension.
In 1910 Tatra manufactured its first bus the Omnibus type SO with total production of five units.
The first true serial truck production at Tatra was instigated by the beginning of World War I.
In the year 1914 there were only two trucks made, type T 14/40 HP; however by 1915's end the production jumped to a total of 105 TL-2 units, and the following year, 1916, the numbers rose to a total of 196 TL-2 and 30 TL-4.
Production peaked in 1917 with 19 TL-2 and 303 TL-4 models, but then production declined, and a similar number of vehicles of one type manufactured in a year was not achieved or surpassed until 1936 with the T 27 model.
Technically models TL-2 and TL-4 were almost identically designed; in fact TL-4 evolved from TL-2 where both had liquid-cooled OHC engines of max power output of 25.7 kW (35 PS; 34 hp).
The TL-2 had a GVM 2,100 kg (4,630 lb) and 4,000 kg (8,818 lb) GCM, TL-4 had 2,700 kg (5,952 lb) GVM and 6,700 kg (14,771 lb) GCM respectively.
Both types remained in production in small series until 1927.
The TL-4 is considered the first truck to come out of NW (Nesselsdorfer Wagen-bau) to carry the name Tatra in 1919.
After the introduction of Tatra 11 and Tatra 12 cars with their distinctive backbone tube design and swing axles, Tatra introduced its first truck on the same basis, the light utility Tatra 13 powered by 2-cylinder air-cooled petrol engine with power output 8.8 kW (12 hp) and 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) cargo capacity.
Further models followed, and in 1926, T23 and T24 were introduced, nicknamed "bulldogs", which could be considered Tatra's precursors to COE designed trucks.
Improved version T13 was introduced as T26 with a more powerful 4-cylinder flat air-cooled engine and in six-wheeler chassis created capable offroad light utility truck which later evolved into T72 model which was heavily used by Czechoslovakian army at the time and was also manufactured under license by the French company Lorraine-Dietrich.
In 1933 Tatra built a limited series of T25 heavy artillery hauler with 4 and 6-cylinder petrol engines.
The most popular Tatra truck before World War II was type T27 powered by 4-cylinder petrol or diesel engines, which remained in production for nearly 17 years (1930–1947) with total production of 7,620 units.
By adding an extra axle to the rear the type T28 was created; however, it was not successful and only limited production resulted in a mainly bus chassis.
In the period from 1931 to 1938 Tatra also built a small utility truck based on the chassis from T30 named Tatra T43 which remain popular with small business owners.
T72 model successfully continued the line to T82 built mainly for military in cargo and personnel transport between 1935 and 1938 and further to T92 and T93 built for the Romanian army from 1938 to 1941 which were identical except T93 had also a driven front axle.
Following the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia the production at Kopřivnice was annexed by the Germans for the supply of trucks needed by the Wehrmacht.
Apart from the existing line up of T27, T92/92 a new heavy truck, the T81, commenced production featuring liquid-cooled 12.5 L V8 diesel engine with a power output of 118 kW (160 PS; 158 hp), in 6×4 axle configuration.
This vehicle evolved in 1942 into the T111 which continued in production until 1962, with the total of 33,690 units made.
The T111 also featured Tatra's first air-cooled diesel engine, a massive V12 originally designed for the armoured Sd.Kfz.
In the latter stages of World War II Tatra was instrumental in the development of air-cooled diesel engines for German tanks.
In late 1944 General Heinz Guderian ordered that production of the Type 38(t) Hetzer tank be modified to incorporate a Tatra Type 928 V-8 air-cooled diesel engine, though this order was delayed so production could continue uninterrupted.
After the war the T111 contributed heavily to the rebuilding effort in Central and Eastern Europe and a memorial was built at Magadan, Siberia, for its exploits in the Far East of the USSR.
The decision to replace the reliable but ageing T111 was taken in 1952 based on central planning economy of socialist government where directive was made to Tatra N.P. that it should concentrate on the manufacture of 7 to 10 ton capacity commercial vehicles and in 1956 first T137 and T138 trucks were exhibited at the Czechoslovak machinery expo in Brno.
Production of the T111 continued alongside the T138 series until 1962.
The T138 itself continued in production until 1969 when it was replaced by the T148, which provided an increase in power output, reliability and product improvements.
In 1967 Tatra began production of the T813 off-road truck using its modular construction technology; the model incorporated the latest trends in commercial vehicle design such as cab-over-engine (COE) and wide profile tyres.
It featured a new V12 engine and all military versions had a central tyre inflation/deflation system as standard equipment.
The T813 was designed to tow loads up to 100 ton GCM and it was a familiar sight on the roads in Czechoslovakia hauling large, often over-sized loads.
The Tatra 815 was designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions are derived from the off-road original.
After the 53rd session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, a directive was issued that Tatra N.P. would be the sole supplier of off-road commercial vehicles of <12 ton capacity for Eastern Bloc countries, leading to a modernization of the company and its production models.
Following extensive testing at different sites, including Siberia, the type T815 was introduced in 1982 with production starting in 1983.
The T815 was made of 142 main assembly components as opposed to the 219 main assembly components of its predecessor.
The engine's power output was increased by up to 45% and a new COE tiltable cabin was introduced.
Modular engine designs resulted in offerings of V8, V10 or V12 engines with or without turbocharger.
T815 was upgraded to T815-2 with minor cosmetic changes and improved ergonomics and safety – the biggest change was the engine emissions accordance with the "Euro0" limits and to Euro I limits in 1993 (turbocharged V8 engine only since this time for the full legislation; the Deutz 513 air-cooled V8 engine was offered as an alternative).
The TerrNo1, introduced in 1997, featured a redesigned cabin as well as better sound and heat insulation than the previous models.
The TerrNo1 was based on the same frame as the previous models, so its cabin could be retrofitted to all type T815s built since 1993.
In 2000, the TerrNo1 cabin was again redesigned, and for the first time there was an option to fit liquid-cooled engines.
The TerrNo1 model introduced the 'KingFrame rear axle suspension setup.
Another step in evolution for the T3B engine came with the Euro II emission limits.
Following further improvements in 2003, the T815 had the new Euro III T3C V8 engine mated to all new 14-speed range+split gearbox as well as an option for engines from other suppliers such as Caterpillar, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, Deutz and MTU to be fitted.
In September 2006, Tatra introduced its Euro IV compliant turbocharged T3D engine with the SCR exhaust technology and in February 2008 the company introduced the world's first Euro V-compliant air-cooled diesel engine based on the T3D engine.
The T816 (T815-6) Armax and Force series, derivatives of Tatra 815, were introduced in 1993 after Tatra participated in the tender process to supply heavy duty off-road trucks to the UAE armed forces.
After two years of bidding, the company secured a contract worth $180 million.
The resulting model became known as T816 "LIWA" (Arabic for "desert").
The latest model intended for military customers is the T817 (T815-7), marketed primarily toward the armed services of NATO member countries as a high-mobility heavy-duty tactical truck with a low profile cabin for C-130 Hercules transportability.
During the 1990s, Tatra decided to produce a bonneted CBE heavy duty off-road truck to continue the successful line started with the T111.
This resulted in the T163 Jamal, which was put into full production in 1999 after the first prototypes were built in 1997 and following extensive testing.
The T163 was purpose-built to be a heavy duty dump truck due to demand, and was based on Tatra's signature backbone tube chassis construction with its cabin being designed by Jiří Španihel.
The truck is used mainly on construction sites and in quarries.
Tatra was also a successful bidder for the Czech Army replacement of aging Praga V3S (with the Tatra I6 air-cooled engine – one half of the T111 V12 one) medium off-road truck with T810 which technically is not a "genuine" Tatra as its origin goes back to when former Czech company ROSS, in partnership with Renault Trucks, obtained a contract to supply the army with medium size off-road trucks, the "ROSS R210 6×6".
The company however went bankrupt in 1998 and Tatra bought full rights to the design, then modernized and reintroduced it as T810 while continuing cooperation with Renault.
Under the deal Renault supplies the cabins and the engines and Praga supplied axles and transmissions for the prototypes; however, the whole project has been dogged by controversy due to the way Tatra had obtained the contract, its relationship with supplier Praga and the subsequent court case brought against it by Praga.
The serial T810 vehicles are equipped with the new design Tatra rigid axles with the WABCO disc brakes, with the ZF Ecolite transmission and Steyr drop box.
Tatra and Navistar Defence introduced at Eurosatory Exposition in Paris, France (Jun 14–18 2010), the results of their strategic alliance since October 2009, the models ATX6 (universal container carrier) and ATX8 (troop carrier).
The vehicles appear to be based on Tatra 815-7 (T817) 6×6, 8×8 chassis, suspension and cabins while using Navistar engines and other components.
Under the deal Navistar Defence and Tatra A.S. will market the vehicles in North America, which includes sales to the United States military and foreign military sales financed by the United States government.
Tatra will source parts and components through Navistar's global parts and support network for Tatra trucks delivered in markets outside of North America as well as market Navistar-Tatra vehicles around the world in their primary markets.
The Terex Corporation, an American company, acquired the majority ownership (71%) of Tatra in late 2003.
As of late 2006, however, majority ownership (80.51%) was in the hands of Tatra Holdings s.r.o., an international consortium comprising Vectra Limited of UK, Sam Eyde of the U.S., KBC Private Equity of Belgium, Meadowhill s.r.o. of Czech Republic and Ronald Adams of the U.S.
On 15 December 2006, a contract was signed between Tatra and the Czech Republic for 556 trucks at roughly $130 million, or 2.6 billion Czech crowns.
This contract was signed in lieu of replacement of older military vehicles.
In April 2007, Tatra announced that it had already matched its production in 2006 and produced 1,600 vehicles.
In 2007, Tatra planned to produce between 2,300 and 2,500 vehicles.
In contrast to previous years, Tatra has increased employment by the hundreds within the past two quarters, has reversed previous errors, and was growing again.
In August 2011, DAF Trucks announced it had built up a 19% stake in Tatra to tighten up cooperation between the companies.
DAF's cabs and Paccar engines became mainstay of the civilian Tatra 158 Phoenix, while DAF dealerships started selling Tatra trucks.
In early 2013, Tatra was facing mounting financial problems.
Even though the company had sufficient orders for new trucks, manufacturing was halted as banks refused to provide further loans and company was facing imminent bankruptcy.
In March 2013, majority stake in Tatra was acquired by major Czech defense contractor Czechoslovak Group and Czech metallurgy company Promet Group, which provided company with necessary financial stability.
With new owners, Tatra focused its production primarily towards building specialist vehicles tailored to buyers' custom orders.
While in 2013 sales amounted to 722 units, in 2023 the company plans to sell over 2,000 trucks, with future increases in sales requiring enlarging of manufacturing capacity.
Tatra 810 Tactic – medium off-road truck based on conventional frame, portal axles and equipped with Renault water-cooled engine and cabin.
Primarily intended for military operators, also offered on civilian market.
Tatra 817 Force – heavy off-road truck based on Tatra backbone chassis, Tatra air-cooled engines (other engines also possible) and Tatra cabin.
Primarily intended for military operators, also offered on civilian market.
Tatra 158 Phoenix – heavy off-road truck based on Tatra backbone chassis and equipped with DAF cabin and ZF water-cooled engines.
Primarily intended for civilian operators, also offered on military market.
Several fire brigades and civil protection (THW) mostly in eastern Germany are traditionally using Tatra trucks.
Tatra's own conversion company THT build vehicles for fire brigades and civil protection.
Popular in Germany is a large Water tender and pumper based on the Tatra 815.
The vehicle's water tank has a volume of 4,000 liters or more and a separate tank for foam agent.
The 4×4 transmission and a gear wading depth of 1.20m make it suitable for rough terrain.
In German use the vehicle is called "TLF4000" (Tanklöschfahrzeug 4000) and is primarily used at airports and to fight forest fires.
In 2021 the Bundeswehr fire brigade ordered 76 Tatra firefighting vehicles to fight forest fires (ordered by BwFuhrparkService GmbH).
They are based upon the Tatra T 815-7 4×4 chassis, with equipment by Austrian Rosenbauer Group.
Tatra had a truck-building joint venture in India called Tatra Vectra Motors Ltd, formerly called
Tatra Trucks India Ltd.
It is a joint venture between Tatra and the Vectra Group from England.
In 2002, the company received a 1,070 trucks order from the Government of India.
Tatra's growing involvement in India's defense industry has been cited as an example of growing relations between Czech Republic and India.
In 2009, Vectra announced a new joint venture with Russia's Kamaz to form Kamaz Vectra Motors Limited to manufacture Kamaz trucks in India.
This joint venture replaced the former Tatra Vectra venture.
The manufacturing plant is located in Hosur, Tamil Nadu.
The fully integrated manufacturing facility includes an engine assembly and testing plant, a cabin welding shop, a frame fabrication shop and a test track.
Most Tatra trucks for sale in India are manufactured in collaboration with Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML).
Tatra was part of a 2012 investigation in what has been described a "procurement scam" involving former BEML chief VRS Natarajan.
Reportedly following one of the Israeli-Arab conflicts, Israel tested some Tatras captured from the Egyptian armed forces.
The Israel Defense Forces' command was apparently quite impressed with their performance, independent air cooling, and their capabilities as military trucks in long-range raiding operations in desert terrain, and became interested in including these trucks in their arsenal.
As direct purchase from Czechoslovakia was impossible due to its alignment with Israeli foes, the lore has it that Israelis used the well-paid services of Nicolae Ceauşescu-led Romania, in cooperation with an American Company called ATC (American Truck Company) to purchase military trucks, including desert-equipped Tatras, leading to jokes that "Romania has a new desert".
Current photos of various Israeli weapon systems, including SPYDER slated for India, show new Tatras as the carrier vehicles.
A number of Tatra trucks entered service in the Israeli Army's various sectors, with the brand mark of "American Truck Company", under which Tatras were sold from the U.S. market and exported to Israel.
American Truck Company was a quasi-independent company set up by Terex, when they controlled Tatra, to import Tatra vehicles in both knock down kits or fully built and carry out assembly operations, repair and service, body building on chassis in the United States.
These trucks were offered to the military and other government organizations and were badged and sold in the United States under the ATC brand.
ATC badged Tatras were fitted with American Cummins turbodiesel engines in place of the Tatra's air-cooled diesel.

Armored vehicle based on the Tatra 815 chassis.
Telematics is a translation of the French word télématique, which was first coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in a 1978 report to the French government on the computerization of society.
It referred to the transfer of information over telecommunications and was a portmanteau blending the French words télécommunications ("telecommunications") and informatique ("computing science").
The original broad meaning of telematics continues to be used in academic fields, but in commerce it now generally means vehicle telematics.
The convergence of telecommunications and information processing, the term later evolved to refer to automation in automobiles, such as the invention of the emergency warning system for vehicles.
GPS navigation, integrated hands-free cell phones, wireless safety communications, and automatic driving assistance systems all are covered under the telematics umbrella.
The science of telecommunications and informatics applied in wireless technologies and computational systems.
802.11p, the IEEE standard in the 802.11 family and also referred to as Wireless Access for the Vehicular Environment (WAVE), is the primary standard that addresses and enhances Intelligent Transport System.
Vehicle telematics can help improve the efficiency of an organization.
Vehicle tracking is monitoring the location, movements, status, and behavior of a vehicle or fleet of vehicles.
This is achieved through a combination of a GPS (GNSS) receiver and an electronic device (usually comprising a GSM GPRS modem or SMS sender) installed in each vehicle, communicating with the user (dispatching, emergency, or co-ordinating unit) and PC-based or web-based software.
The data is turned into information by management reporting tools in conjunction with a visual display on computerized mapping software.
Vehicle tracking systems may also use odometry or dead reckoning as an alternative or complementary means of navigation.
GPS tracking is usually accurate to around 10–20 meters, but the European Space Agency has developed the EGNOS technology to provide accuracy to 1.5 meters.
Trailer tracking refers to the tracking of movements and position of an articulated vehicle's trailer unit through the use of a location unit fitted to the trailer and a method of returning the position data via mobile communication network, IOT (Internet of things), or geostationary satellite communications for use through either PC- or web-based software.
Cold-store freight trailers that deliver fresh or frozen foods are increasingly incorporating telematics to gather time-series data on the temperature inside the cargo container, both to trigger alarms and record an audit trail for business purposes.
An increasingly sophisticated array of sensors, many incorporating RFID technology, is being used to ensure the cold chain.
Freight containers can be tracked by GPS using a similar approach to that used for trailer tracking (i.e. a battery-powered GPS device communicating its position via mobile phone or satellite communications).
Benefits of this approach include increased security and the possibility to reschedule the container transport movements based on accurate information about its location.
According to Berg Insight, the installed base of tracking units in the intermodal shipping container segment reached 190,000 at the end of 2013.
Growing at a compound annual growth rate of 38.2 percent, the installed base reached 960,000 units at the end of 2018.
Fleet management is the management of a company's fleet and includes the management of ships and/or motor vehicles such as cars, vans, and trucks.
Fleet (vehicle) management can include a range of functions, such as vehicle financing, vehicle maintenance, vehicle telematics (tracking and diagnostics), driver management, fuel management, health and safety management, and dynamic vehicle scheduling.
Fleet management is a function which allows companies that rely on transport in their business to remove or minimize the risks associated with vehicle investment, improving efficiency and productivity while reducing overall transport costs and ensuring compliance with government legislation and Duty of Care obligations.
These functions can either be dealt with by an in-house fleet management department or an outsourced fleet management provider.
The Association of Equipment Management Professionals (AEMP) developed the industry's first telematics standard.
The result, the AEMP Telematics Data Standard V1.1, was released in 2010 and officially went live on October 1, 2010.
As of November 1, 2010, Caterpillar, Volvo CE, John Deere Construction & Forestry, OEM Data Delivery, and Navman Wireless are able to support customers with delivery of basic telematics data in a standard xml format.
Komatsu, Topcon, and others are finishing beta testing and have indicated their ability to support customers in the near future.
The AEMP's telematics data standard was developed to allow end users to integrate key telematics data (operating hours, location, fuel consumed, and odometer reading where applicable) into their existing fleet management reporting systems.
As such, the standard was primarily intended to facilitate importation of these data elements into enterprise software systems such as those used by many medium-to-large construction contractors.
Prior to the standard, end users had few options for integrating this data into their reporting systems in a mixed-fleet environment consisting of multiple brands of machines and a mix of telematics-equipped machines and legacy machines (those without telematics devices where operating data is still reported manually via pen and paper).
One option available to machine owners was to visit multiple websites to manually retrieve data from each manufacturer's telematics interface and then manually enter it into their fleet management program's database.
This option was cumbersome and labor-intensive.
A second option was for the end user to develop an API (Application Programming Interface), or program, to integrate the data from each telematics provider into their database.
This option was quite costly as each telematics provider had different procedures for accessing and retrieving the data and the data format varied from provider to provider.
This option automated the process, but because each provider required a unique, custom API to retrieve and parse the data, it was an expensive option.
In addition, another API had to be developed any time another brand of machine or telematics device was added to the fleet.
A third option for mixed-fleet integration was to replace the various factory-installed telematics devices with devices from a third party telematics provider.
Although this solved the problem of having multiple data providers requiring unique integration methods, this was by far the most expensive option.
In addition to the expense, many third-party devices available for construction equipment are unable to access data directly from the machine's electronic control modules (ECMs), or computers, and are more limited than the device installed by the OEM (Cat, Volvo, Deere, Komatsu, etc.)
in the data they are able to provide.
In some cases, these devices are limited to location and engine runtime, although they are increasingly able to accommodate a number of add-on sensors to provide additional data.
The AEMP Telematics Data Standard provides a fourth option.
By concentrating on the key data elements that drive the majority of fleet management reports (hours, miles, location, fuel consumption), making those data elements available in a standardized xml format, and standardizing the means by which the document is retrieved, the standard enables the end user to use one API to retrieve data from any participating telematics provider (as opposed to the unique API for each provider that was required previously), greatly reducing integration development costs.
The current draft version of the AEMP Telematics Data Standard is now called the AEM/AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard, which expands the original standard Version 1.2 to include 19 data fields (with fault code capability).
This new draft standard is a collaborative effort of AEMP and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), working on behalf of their members and the industry.
This Draft API replaces the current version 1.2 and does not currently cover some types of equipment, e.g., agriculture equipment, cranes, mobile elevating work platforms, air compressors, and other niche products.
In addition to the new data fields, the AEM/AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard changes how data is accessed in an effort to make it easier to consume and integrate with other systems and processes.
It includes standardized communication protocols for the ability to transfer telematics information in mixed-equipment fleets to end user business enterprise systems, enabling the end user to employ their own business software to collect and then analyze asset data from mixed-equipment fleets without the need to work across multiple telematics provider applications.
To achieve a globally recognized standard for conformity worldwide, the AEM/AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard will be submitted for acceptance by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
Final language is dependent upon completion of the ISO acceptance process.
Satellite navigation in the context of vehicle telematics is the technology of using a GPS and electronic mapping tool to enable a driver to locate a position, plan a route, and navigate a journey.
Mobile data is the use of wireless data communications using radio waves to send and receive real-time computer data to, from, and between devices used by field-based personnel.
These devices can be fitted solely for use while in the vehicle (Fixed Data Terminal) or for use in and out of the vehicle (Mobile Data Terminal).
See mobile Internet.
The common methods for mobile data communication for telematics were based on private vendors' RF communication infrastructure.
During the early 2000s, manufacturers of mobile data terminals/AVL devices moved to try cellular data communication to offer cheaper ways to transmit telematics information and wider range based on cellular provider coverage.
Since then, as a result of cellular providers offering low GPRS (2.5G) and later UMTS (3G) rates, mobile data is almost totally offered to telematics customers via cellular communication.
Wireless vehicle safety communications telematics aid in car safety and road safety.
It is an electronic subsystem in a vehicle used for exchanging safety information about road hazards and the locations and speeds of vehicles over short-range radio links.
This may involve temporary ad hoc wireless local area networks.
Wireless units are often installed in vehicles and fixed locations, such as near traffic signals and emergency call boxes along the road.
Sensors in vehicles and at fixed locations, as well as in possible connections to wider networks, provide information displayed to drivers.
The range of the radio links can be extended by forwarding messages along multi-hop paths.
Even without fixed units, information about fixed hazards can be maintained by moving vehicles by passing it backwards.
It also seems possible for traffic lights, which one can expect to become smarter, to use this information to reduce the chance of collisions.
In the future, it may connect directly to the adaptive cruise control or other vehicle control aids.
Cars and trucks with the wireless system connected to their brakes may move in convoys to save fuel and space on the roads.
When a column member slows down, those behind it will automatically slow also.
Certain scenarios may required less engineering effort, such as when a radio beacon is connected to a brake light.
In fall 2008, network ideas were tested in Europe, where radio frequency bandwidth had been allocated.
The 30 MHz allocated is at 5.9 GHz, and unallocated bandwidth at 5.4 GHz may also be used.
The standard is IEEE 802.11p, a low-latency form of the Wi-Fi local area network standard.
Similar efforts are underway in Japan and the USA.
Telematics technologies are self-orientating open network architecture structures of variable programmable intelligent beacons developed for application in the development of intelligent vehicles with the intent to accord (blend or mesh) warning information with surrounding vehicles in the vicinity of travel, intra-vehicle, and infrastructure.
Emergency warning systems for vehicle telematics are developed particularly for international harmonization and standardization of vehicle-to-vehicle, infrastructure-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure real-time Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) systems.
Telematics most commonly relate to computerized systems that update information at the same rate they receive data, enabling them to direct or control a process such as an instantaneous autonomous warning notification in a remote machine or group of machines.
In the use of telematics relating to intelligent vehicle technologies, instantaneous direction travel cognizance of a vehicle may be transmitted in real-time to surrounding vehicles traveling in the local area of vehicles equipped (with EWSV) to receive said warning signals of danger.
Telematics comprise electronic, electromechanical, and electromagnetic devices—usually silicon micro-machined components operating in conjunction with computer-controlled devices and radio transceivers to provide precision repeatability functions (such as in robotics artificial intelligence systems) emergency warning validation performance reconstruction.
Intelligent vehicle technologies commonly apply to car safety systems and self-contained autonomous electromechanical sensors generating warnings that can be transmitted within a specified targeted area of interest, i.e. within 100 meters of the emergency warning system for the vehicle's transceiver.
In ground applications, intelligent vehicle technologies are utilized for safety and commercial communications between vehicles or between a vehicle and a sensor along the road.
On November 3, 2009, the most advanced Intelligent Vehicle concept car was demonstrated in New York City when a 2010 Toyota Prius became the first LTE connected car.
The demonstration was provided by the NG Connect project, a collaboration of automotive telematic technologies designed to exploit in-car 4G wireless network connectivity.
Telematics technology has enabled the emergence of carsharing services such as Local Motion, Uber, Lyft, Car2Go, Zipcar worldwide, or City Car Club in the UK.
Telematics-enabled computers allow organizers to track members' usage and bill them on a pay-as-you-drive basis.
Some systems show users where to find an idle vehicle.
Car Clubs such as Australia's Charter Drive use telematics to monitor and report on vehicle use within predefined geofence areas to demonstrate the reach of their transit media car club fleet.
The general idea of telematics auto insurance is that a driver's behavior is monitored directly while the person drives and this information is transmitted to an insurance company.
The insurance company then assesses the risk of that driver having an accident and charges insurance premiums accordingly.
A driver who drives less responsibly will be charged a higher premium than a driver who drives smoothly and with less calculated risk of claim propensity.
Other benefits can be delivered to end users with Telematics2.0-based telematics as customer engagement can be enhanced with direct customer interaction.
Telematics auto insurance was independently invented and patented by a major U.S. auto insurance company, Progressive Auto Insurance U.S. patent 5,797,134, and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez (European Patent EP0700009B1).
The Perez patents cover monitoring the car's engine control computer to determine distance driven, speed, time of day, braking force, etc.
Progressive is currently developing the Perez technology in the U.S. and European auto insurer Norwich Union is developing the Progressive technology for Europe.
Both patents have since been overturned in courts due to prior work in the commercial insurance sectors.
The smartphone as the in-vehicle device for insurance telematics has been discussed in great detail and the instruments are available for the design of smartphone-driven insurance telematics.

HuffPost (The Huffington Post until 2017; often abbreviated as HuffPo) is an American progressive news website, with localized and international editions.
The site offers news, satire, blogs, and original content, and covers politics, business, entertainment, environment, technology, popular media, lifestyle, culture, comedy, healthy eating, young women's interests, and local news featuring columnists.
It was created to provide a progressive alternative to conservative news websites such as the Drudge Report.
The site contains its own content and user-generated content via video blogging, audio, and photo.
In 2012, the website became the first commercially run United States digital media enterprise to win a Pulitzer Prize.
Founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti, the site was launched on May 9, 2005, as a counterpart to the Drudge Report.
In March 2011, it was acquired by AOL for US$315 million, with Arianna Huffington appointed editor-in-chief.
In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion, and the site became a part of Verizon Media.
In November 2020, BuzzFeed acquired the company.
Weeks after the acquisition, BuzzFeed laid off 47 HuffPost staff, mostly journalists, in the U.S. and closed down HuffPost Canada, laying off 23 staff working for the Canadian and Quebec divisions of the company.
The Huffington Post was launched on May 9, 2005, as a commentary outlet, blog, and an alternative to news aggregators such as the Drudge Report.
It was founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti.
Prior to this, Arianna Huffington hosted the website Ariannaonline.com.
Her first foray into the Internet was the website Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President Bill Clinton and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton.
In August 2006, The Huffington Post raised a $5 million Series A round from SoftBank Capital and Greycroft.
In December 2008, The Huffington Post raised $25 million from Oak Investment Partners at a $100 million valuation and Fred Harman of Oak Investment Partners joined its board of directors.
The money was to be used for technology, infrastructure, investigative journalism, and development of local versions.
In June 2009, Eric Hippeau, co-managing partner of Softbank Capital, became CEO of The Huffington Post.
In January 2011, The Huffington Post received 35% of its traffic from web search engines (SEOs), compared to 20% at CNN.
This strategy appealed to AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who tried to implement similar SEO-driven journalism practices at AOL at the time of its acquisition of The Huffington Post.
In March 2011, AOL acquired The Huffington Post for US$315 million.
As part of the deal, Huffington became president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post and existing AOL properties Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, MapQuest, Black Voices, PopEater (now HuffPost Celebrity), AOL Music, AOL Latino (now HuffPost Voices), AutoBlog, Patch, and StyleList.
In December 2011, The Huffington Post said it had 36.2 million unique visitors.
The Huffington Post subsumed many of AOL's Voices properties, including AOL Black Voices, which was established in 1995 as Blackvoices.com, and AOL Latino, Impact (launched in 2010 as a partnership between Huffington Post and Causecast), Women, Teen, College, Religion, and the Spanish-language Voces (en español).
The Voices brand was expanded in September 2011 with the launch of Gay Voices, dedicated to LGBT-relevant articles.
By late 2013, the website operated as a "stand-alone business" within AOL, taking control of more of its own business and advertising operations, and directing more effort towards securing "premium advertising".
In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media.
Huffington resigned to pursue other ventures and was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Lydia Polgreen in December 2016.
In April 2017, Polgreen announced the company would rebrand, changing its official full name to HuffPost, with changes to the design of its website and logo, and content and reporting.
On January 24, 2019, 20 employees were laid off as a part of Verizon Media laying off 7% of its staff.
The opinion and health sections were eliminated.
Pulitzer Prize finalist Jason Cherkis lost his job.
On March 6, 2020, Polgreen announced that she would step down as editor-in-chief to become the head of content at Gimlet Media.
In November 2020, HuffPost shut down its India operation after six years.
According to some media reports, the acquisition did not include the India site due to regulations barring foreign ownership of Indian Digital Media.
On February 16, 2021, BuzzFeed acquired HuffPost from Verizon Media in a stock deal.
On March 9, 2021, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said that the company had lost "around $20 million" during the previous year, and HuffPost Canada was shut down and ceased publishing.
On April 12, 2021, Danielle Belton became editor-in-chief.
Following the gradual shut-down of BuzzFeed News announced in 2023, BuzzFeed, Inc. refocused its news efforts into HuffPost, with plans to rehire past BuzzFeed News employees at HuffPost or  at BuzzFeed.

The site originally published work from both paid reporters and unpaid bloggers through its contributor platform.
In February 2011, Visual Art Source, which had been cross-posting material from its website, went on strike against The Huffington Post to protest against its writers not being paid.
In March 2011, the strike and the call to boycott was joined and endorsed by the National Writers Union and NewsGuild-CWA; however, the boycott was dropped in October 2011.
In April 2011, The Huffington Post was targeted with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit by Jonathan Tasini on behalf of thousands of bloggers who had submitted material to the website.
On March 30, 2012, the suit was dismissed with prejudice by the court, holding that the bloggers had volunteered their services, their compensation being publication.
In 2015, Wil Wheaton stated that he refused to allow his work to be reused for free on the site.
HuffPost has been criticized for providing a platform for alternative medicine and supporters of vaccine hesitancy, including in a detailed critique in 2009 by physician and author Rahul Parikh.
In 2020, biology professor and founder of the science blog Pharyngula addressed hesitancy and other issues.
Steven Novella, president of the New England Skeptical Society, criticized The Huffington Post for allowing homeopathy proponent Dana Ullman to have a blog on the site.
In 2011, skeptic Brian Dunning listed it at No. 10 on his "Top 10 Worst Anti-Science Websites" list.
In January 2012, The Huffington Post was criticized for appointing as editorial director in France the well-known former TV journalist Anne Sinclair, because she stood by her husband Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former IMF head, when several women accused him of sexual assault.
Commentators at l'Express, Rue89, and Le Monde warned against potential conflict of interest in the French edition's news coverage.
In April 2017, HuffPost South Africa was directed by the press ombudsman to apologize unreservedly for publishing and later defending a column calling for disenfranchisement of white men, which was declared malicious, inaccurate and discriminatory hate speech.

Thomas Blanchard (June 24, 1788 – April 16, 1864) was an American inventor who lived much of his life in Springfield, Massachusetts, where in 1819, he pioneered the assembly line style of mass production in America, and also invented the first machining lathe for interchangeable parts.
Blanchard worked, for much of his career, with the Springfield Armory.
In 1825, Blanchard also invented America's first car, which he called a "horseless carriage," powered by steam.
During Blanchard's lifetime, he was awarded over twenty-five patents for his creations.
He was born in Sutton, Massachusetts.
He had a fondness for mechanical employment, and was associated with his brother in the manufacture of tacks by hand.
This process was exceedingly slow and tedious, and his first machine, made and patented in 1806, was a mechanical tack-maker, which could fabricate five hundred tacks per minute, each much better than tacks made by hand.
He sold the rights to his machine for $5,000.
Blanchard then turned his attention to gun barrels, and invented a machine tool that streamlined the process of their manufacture.
Hired by the Springfield Armory during its construction, Blanchard finished the machine in 1822.
The machine turned and finished gun barrels in a single operation; the octagon portion of the barrel was finished by changing the action of the lathe to vibratory motion.
This invention was afterward extended to the turning of all kinds of irregular forms.
He also developed a copying lathe that traced a model to turn gun stocks, producing the desired contour automatically (1818).
The copying lathe began being used to make shoe lasts (forms) in the 1850s.
By being able to accurately reproduce lasts it was possible to make shoes in standard sizes.
Turning his attention to transportation, Blanchard invented a "steam wagon" before the introduction of railroads in the United States, and in 1831 created a powerful upriver steamboat that was used on the Connecticut River and the West, both of which he invented and patented in Springfield, Massachusetts.
In 1851, he designed and created a machine that could bend dense and strong wood.
Blanchard also constructed machines for cutting and folding envelopes at a single operation, and several mortising machines.

Some engine control units (ECUs) also control the throttle position by electronic throttle control (ETC) or "drive by wire" systems, and if that is done, the position sensor is used in a feedback loop to enable that control.
Related to the TPS are accelerator pedal sensors, which often include a wide open throttle (WOT) sensor.
The accelerator pedal sensors are used in electronic throttle control or "drive by wire" systems, and the most common use of a wide open throttle sensor is for the kick-down function on automatic transmissions.
Modern day sensors are non contact type.
These modern non contact TPS include Hall effect sensors, inductive sensors, magnetoresistive and others.
In the potentiometric type sensors, a multi-finger metal brush/rake is in contact with a resistive strip, while the butterfly valve is turned from the lower mechanical stop (minimum air position) to WOT, there is a change in the resistance and this change in resistance is given as the input to the ECU.
Non contact type TPS work on the principle of Hall effect or inductive sensors, or magnetoresistive technologies, wherein generally the magnet or inductive loop is the dynamic part which is mounted on the butterfly valve throttle spindle/shaft gear and the sensor & signal processing circuit board is mounted within the ETC gear box cover and is stationary.
When the magnet/inductive loop mounted on the spindle which is rotated from the lower mechanical stop to WOT, there is a change in the magnetic field for the sensor.
The change in the magnetic field is sensed by the sensor and the voltage generated is given as the input to the ECU.
Normally a two pole rare-earth magnet is used for the TPS due to their high Curie temperatures required in the under-hood vehicle environment.
The magnet may be of diametrical type, ring type, rectangular or segment type.
The magnet is defined to have a certain magnetic field that does not vary significantly with time or temperature.
This is a chronological index for the start year for motor vehicle brands (up to 1969).
For manufacturers that went on to produce many models, it represents the start date of the whole brand; for the others, it usually represents the date of appearance of the main (perhaps only) model that was produced.
This also gives an idea of what motor vehicles were appearing on the streets in each country around each date (allowing, too, for imports from other countries).
Moreover, by showing which models were contemporary, it gives a first indication of how individual designers were being influenced by each other, and a flavor of the entrepreneurial spirit and dynamics of the pioneering days of motor vehicle manufacture.
Within each year, and country of origin, the lists are structured according to the type of vehicle first introduced.
These include the following types: steam, electric, hybrid electric, internal-combustion, touring car, roadster, tonneau, phaeton, cyclecar, light car, voiturette, runabout, high wheeler, buggy, tricar, motor quadricycle, motor tricycle, motorcycle, coach, bus, fire-engine, truck, tractor, racing car, avant-train.

Thomas Rickett's steam-powered car was particularly notable in the history of motor vehicle production inasmuch as several examples were made, and it was also advertised.
The Bollée family played a significant part in the history of motor vehicle manufacture; the father with his steam car, and one of his sons, in 1895, with an internal-combustion engine design.
Karl Benz's vehicle was the first true automobile, entirely designed as such, rather than simply being a motorized stage coach or horse carriage.
This is why he was granted his patent, and is regarded as its inventor.
His wife and sons became the first true motorists, in 1889, when they took the car out for the specific task of paying a family visit.
The first Daimler car was a converted carriage, but with innovations that are still adopted today (cushioned engine mountings, fan cooling, finned-radiator water cooling).
Panhard and Levassor's design of a front-mounted engine established the layout of the majority of cars since then.
In the UK, the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 replaced the hugely restrictive Locomotive Acts of 1861, 1865 and 1878 (the so-called Red Flag acts) thereby finally freeing up the automotive industry in the UK (and, incidentally, was also the origin of the celebrations of the first London to Brighton Veteran Car Run).
Knight had been convicted under the old act, the previous year, for not having a man precede his vehicle with a red flag, and Walter Arnold was the first person to be convicted, in January 1896, for exceeding the speed limit.
Meanwhile, Serpollet was issued with what was effectively the first driving licence.

A taxi, also known as a taxicab or simply a cab, is a type of vehicle for hire with a driver, used by a single passenger or small group of passengers, often for a non-shared ride.
A taxicab conveys passengers between locations of their choice.
This differs from public transport where the pick-up and drop-off locations are decided by the service provider, not by the customers, although demand responsive transport and share taxis provide a hybrid bus/taxi mode.
Although types of vehicles and methods of regulation, hiring, dispatching, and negotiating payment differ significantly from country to country, many common characteristics exist.
Disputes over whether ridesharing companies should be regulated as taxicabs resulted in some jurisdictions creating new regulations for these services.
The word taxicab is a compound word formed as a contraction of taximeter and cabriolet.
Taximeter is an adaptation of the German word Taxameter, which is itself a variant of the earlier German word Taxanom.
Taxe /ˈtaksə/ is a German word meaning "tax", "charge", or "scale of charges".
The Medieval Latin word taxa also means tax or charge.
Taxi may ultimately be attributed to Ancient Greek τάξις from τάσσω meaning "to place in a certain order," as in commanding an orderly battle line, or in ordaining the payment of taxes, to the extent that ταξίδι (taxidi), meaning "journey" in Modern Greek, initially denoted an orderly military march or campaign.
Meter is from the Greek μέτρον (metron) meaning "measure."
A cabriolet is a type of horse-drawn carriage; the word comes from French cabrioler ("to leap, caper"), from Italian capriolare ("to somersault"), from Latin capreolus ("roebuck", "wild goat").
In most European languages that word has taken on the meaning of a convertible car.
The taxicabs of Paris were equipped with the first meters beginning on 9 March 1898.
They were originally called taxamètres, then renamed taximètres on 17 October 1904.
Harry Nathaniel Allen of The New York Taxicab Company, who imported the first 600 gas-powered New York City taxicabs from France in 1907, borrowed the word "taxicab" from London, where the word was in use by early 1907.
A popular but erroneous account holds that the vehicles were named after Franz von Taxis from the house of Thurn and Taxis, a 16th-century postmaster for Philip of Burgundy, and his nephew Johann Baptiste von Taxis, General Postmaster for the Holy Roman Empire.
Both instituted fast and reliable postal services (conveying letters, with some post routes transporting people) across Europe.
Their surname derives from their 13th-century ancestor Omodeo Tasso.
Horse-drawn for-hire hackney carriage services began operating in both Paris and London in the early 17th century.
The first documented public hackney coach service for hire was in London in 1605.
In 1625 carriages were made available for hire from innkeepers in London and the first taxi rank appeared on the Strand outside the Maypole Inn in 1636.
In 1635 the Hackney Carriage Act was passed by Parliament to legalise horse-drawn carriages for hire.
Coaches were hired out by innkeepers to merchants and visitors.
A further "Ordinance for the Regulation of Hackney-Coachmen in London and the places adjacent" was approved by Parliament in 1654 and the first hackney-carriage licences were issued in 1662.
The hansom cab was designed and patented in 1834 by Joseph Hansom, an architect from York as a substantial improvement on the old hackney carriages.
These two-wheel vehicles were fast, light enough to be pulled by a single horse (making the journey cheaper than travelling in a larger four-wheel coach) were agile enough to steer around horse-drawn vehicles in the notorious traffic jams of nineteenth-century London and had a low centre of gravity for safe cornering.
Hansom's original design was modified by John Chapman and several others to improve its practicability, but retained Hansom's name.
These soon replaced the hackney carriage as a vehicle for hire.
They quickly spread to other cities in the United Kingdom, as well as continental European cities, particularly Paris, Berlin, and St Petersburg.
The cab was introduced to other British Empire cities and to the United States during the late 19th century, being most commonly used in New York City.
The first cab service in Toronto, "The City", was established in 1837 by Thornton Blackburn, an ex-slave whose escape when captured in Detroit was the impetus for the Blackburn Riots.
The modern taximeter was invented and perfected by a trio of German inventors; Wilhelm Friedrich Nedler, Ferdinand Dencker and Friedrich Wilhelm Gustav Bruhn.
The Daimler Victoria—the world's first motorized-powered taximeter-cab—was built by Gottlieb Daimler in 1897 and began operating in Stuttgart in June 1897.
Gasoline-powered taxicabs began operating in Paris in 1899, in London in 1903, and in New York in 1907.
The New York taxicabs were initially imported from France by Harry N. Allen, owner of the Allen-Kingston Motor Car Company.
Their manufacturing took place at Bristol Engineering in Bristol, Connecticut where the first domestically produced Taxicabs were built in 1908, designed by Fred E. Moskovics who had worked at Daimler in the late 1890s.
Albert F. Rockwell was the owner of Bristol and his wife suggested he paint his taxicabs yellow to maximise his vehicles' visibility.
Moskovics was one of the organizers of the first Yellow Taxicab Company in New York.
Electric battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century.
In London, Walter Bersey designed a fleet of such cabs and introduced them to the streets of London on 19 August 1897.
They were soon nicknamed 'Hummingbirds' due to the idiosyncratic humming noise they made.
In the same year in New York City, the Samuel's Electric Carriage and Wagon Company began running 12 electric hansom cabs.
The company ran until 1898 with up to 62 cabs operating until it was reformed by its financiers to form the Electric Vehicle Company.
Taxicabs proliferated around the world in the early 20th century.
The first major innovation after the invention of the taximeter occurred in the late 1940s, when two-way radios first appeared in taxicabs.
Radios enabled taxicabs and dispatch offices to communicate and serve customers more efficiently than previous methods, such as using callboxes.
The next major innovation occurred in the 1980s when computer assisted dispatching was first introduced.
Paris taxis played a memorable part in the French victory at First Battle of the Marne in the First World War.
On 7 September 1914, the Military Governor of Paris, Joseph Gallieni, gathered about six hundred taxicabs at Les Invalides in central Paris to carry soldiers to the front at Nanteuil-le Haudouin, fifty kilometers away.
Within twenty-four hours about six thousand soldiers and officers were moved to the front.
Each taxi carried five soldiers, four in the back and one next to the driver.
Only the back lights of the taxis were lit; the drivers were instructed to follow the lights of the taxi ahead.
The Germans were surprised and were pushed back by the French and British armies.
Most of the taxis were demobilized on 8 September but some remained longer to carry the wounded and refugees.
The taxis, following city regulations, dutifully ran their meters.
The French treasury reimbursed the total fare of 70,012 francs.
The military impact of the soldiers moved by taxi was small in the huge scale of the Battle of the Marne, but the effect on French morale was enormous; it became the symbol of the solidarity between the French army and citizens.
It was also the first recorded large-scale use of motorized infantry in battle.
The Birmingham pub bombings on 21 November 1974, which killed 21 people and injured 182, presented emergency services with unprecedented peacetime demands.
According to eyewitness accounts, the fire officer in charge, knowing the 40 ambulances he requested were unlikely to be available, requested the Taxi Owners Association to transport the injured to the nearby Birmingham Accident Hospital and Birmingham General Hospital.
Cities like London and Tokyo have implemented specific regulations like London's Conditions of Fitness that dictate size, fuel efficiency, emissions, and accessibility standards far stricter than that for private vehicles.
Much like the NY Checker cabs of the 60s–80s, the unique attributes of the city often make the vehicles built to fit those requirements ubiquitous to its livery fleets, and often becomes an iconic image of the city itself.
Although New York City's efforts to implement new regulations has stumbled in its efforts to mandate both a hybrid and wheelchair-accessible vehicle, London and Tokyo's efforts have yielded unique vehicles such the LEVC TX and Toyota JPN Taxi that meet and exceed modern emissions and accessibility requirements for the future, and will hopefully soon extend to other cities as older models get rotated out of the bigger cities and into smaller markets.
Modifications of existing minivans such as the Mercedes Vito London Taxi and the Nissan NV200 have been introduced as a stopgap measures to fill the need for alternative products, however their acceptance by drivers is yet to be seen.
In recent years, some companies have been adding specially modified vehicles capable of transporting wheelchair-using passengers to their fleets.
Such taxicabs are variously called accessible taxis, wheelchair- or wheelchair-accessible taxicabs, modified taxicabs, or "maxicabs".
Wheelchair taxicabs are most often specially modified vans or minivans.
Wheelchair-using passengers are loaded, with the help of the driver, via a lift or, more commonly, a ramp, at the rear of the vehicle.
This feature is however a subject for concern amongst Licensing Authorities who feel that the wheelchair passenger could not easily exit the vehicle in the event of accident damage to the rear door.
The latest generation of accessible taxis features side loading with emergency egress possible from either of the 2 side doors as well as the rear.
The wheelchair is secured using various systems, commonly including some type of belt and clip combination, or wheel locks.
Some wheelchair taxicabs are capable of transporting only one wheelchair-using passenger at a time, and can usually accommodate 4 to 6 additional non-disabled passengers.
Wheelchair taxicabs are part of the regular fleet in most cases, and so are not reserved exclusively for the use of wheelchair users.
They are often used by non-disabled people who need to transport luggage, small items of furniture, animals, and other items.
Because of this, and since only a small percentage of the average fleet is modified, wheelchair users must often wait for significantly longer periods when calling for a cab, and flagging a modified taxicab on the street is much more difficult.
London's taxis have been fully accessible since January 2000, with all taxis fitted with a pull-out or portable ramp.
Taxicabs in less developed places can be a completely different experience, such as the antique French cars typically found in Cairo.
However, starting in March 2006, newer modern taxicabs entered the service operated by various private companies.
Taxicabs differ in other ways as well: London's black cabs have a large compartment beside the driver for storing bags, while many fleets of regular taxis also include wheelchair accessible taxicabs among their numbers (see above).
Although taxicabs have traditionally been sedans, minivans, hatchbacks and even SUV taxicabs are becoming increasingly common.
In many cities, limousines operate as well, usually in competition with taxicabs and at higher fares.
Recently, with growing concern for the environment, there have been solar powered taxicabs.
On 20 April 2008, a "solar taxi tour" was launched that aimed to tour 15 countries in 18 months in a solar taxi that can reach speeds of 90 km/h with zero emission.
The aim of the tour was to spread knowledge about environmental protection.
Most taxi companies have some sort of livery on the vehicle, depending on the type of taxi (taxi, cab, private hire, chauffeur), country, region and operator.
Most places allow a taxi to be "hailed" or "flagged" on the side of the street as it is approaching.
Another option is a taxi stand (sometimes also called a "cab stand," "hack stand," "taxi rank," or "cab rank").
Taxi stands are usually located at airports, railway stations, major retail areas (malls), hotels and other places where a large number of passengers are likely to be found.
In some places—Japan, for example—taxi stands are arranged according to the size of the taxis, so that large- and small-capacity cabs line up separately.
The taxi at the front of the line is due (barring unusual circumstances) for the next fare.
Passengers also commonly call a central dispatch office for taxis.
In some jurisdictions, private hire vehicles can only be hired from the dispatch office, and must be assigned each fare by the office by radio or phone.
Picking up passengers off the street in these areas can lead to suspension or revocation of the driver's taxi license, or even prosecution.
Other areas may have a mix of the two systems, where drivers may respond to radio calls and also pick up street fares.
Passengers may also hire taxicabs via mobile apps.
While not directly involving the call center, the taxis are still monitored by the dispatcher through GPS tracking.
Many taxicab companies, including Gett, Easy Taxi, and GrabTaxi provide mobile apps.
The activity of taxi fleets is usually monitored and controlled by a central office, which provides dispatching, accounting, and human resources services to one or more taxi companies.
Taxi owners and drivers usually communicate with the dispatch office through either a 2-way radio or a computer terminal (called a mobile data terminal).
Before the innovation of radio dispatch in the 1950s, taxi drivers would use a callbox—a special telephone at a taxi stand—to contact the dispatch office.
When a customer calls for a taxi, a trip is dispatched by either radio or computer, via an in-vehicle mobile data terminal, to the most suitable cab.
The most suitable cab may either be the one closest to the pick-up address (often determined by GPS coordinates nowadays) or the one that was the first to book into the "zone" surrounding the pickup address.
Cabs are sometimes dispatched from their taxi stands; a call to "Top of the 2" means that the first cab in line at stand #2 is supposed to pick someone up.
In offices using radio dispatch, taxi locations are often tracked using magnetic pegs on a "board"—a metal sheet with an engraved map of taxi zones.
In computerized dispatch, the status of taxis is tracked by the computer system.
Taxi frequencies are generally licensed in duplex pairs.
One frequency is used for the dispatcher to talk to the cabs, and a second frequency is used to the cabs to talk back.
This means that the drivers generally cannot talk to each other.
Some cabs have a CB radio in addition to the company radio so they can speak to each other.
In the United States, there is a Taxicab Radio Service with pairs assigned for this purpose.
A taxi company can also be licensed in the Business Radio Service.
Business frequencies in the UHF range are also licensed in pairs to allow for repeaters, though taxi companies usually use the pair for duplex communications.
Taxi dispatch is evolving in connection to the telecom sector with the advent of smart-phones.
In some countries such as Australia, Canada, Germany, the UK and USA, smartphone applications are emerging that connect taxi drivers directly with passengers for the purpose of dispatching taxi jobs, launching new battles for the marketing of such apps over the potential mass of Taxi users.
Taxi fares are set by the state and city where they are permitted to operate.
The fare includes the 'drop', a set amount that is tallied for getting into the taxi plus the 'per kilometer' rate as has been set by the city.
The taxi meters track time as well as distance in an average taxi fare.
In the United States, a nut is industry slang for the amount of money a driver has to pay upfront to lease a taxi for a specific period of time.
Once that amount is collected in fare, the driver then begins to make a profit.
A driver "on the nut" is trying to earn back the initial cost.
This varies from city to city though, in Las Vegas, Nevada, all taxicabs are owned and operated by the companies and all drivers are employees (hence no initial cost and earn a percentage of each fare).
So "on the nut" simply means to be next in a taxi stand to receive a passenger.
Additionally, some cab companies are owned cooperatively, with profits shared through democratic governance.
New South Wales:
There is an annual taxi licence determination which sets the maximum number of taxis allowed in specified areas.
To be eligible you must have a taxi licence which is available from ABLIS.
The industry body is the NSW Taxi Council and it provides a pathway to becoming a taxi driver.
Northern Territory: Apply for a Commercial Passenger Vehicle licence (H endorsement) and ID card.
Queensland:
Apply for a driver authorisation.
South Australia: Apply for South Australian driver accreditation with the SA government then complete training with a registered training provider.
New Zealand taxi drivers fall under the definition of a Small Passenger Service Vehicle driver.
They must have a P (passenger) endorsement on their driver licence.
Until 1 October 2017, all drivers wanting to obtain a P endorsement had to complete a P endorsement course, but that requirement was removed as a result of lobbying by Uber who had been flouting the law.
Drivers must comply with work-time rules and maintain a logbook, with the onus on training falling on companies and drivers since the P endorsement course was abandoned.
The New Zealand Taxi Federation is the national advocacy group for taxi companies within New Zealand.
Most experienced taxi drivers who have been working in the same city or region for a while would be expected to know the most important streets and places where their customers request to go.
However, to aid the process of manual navigation and the taxi driver's memory (and the customer's as well at times) a cab driver is usually equipped with a detailed roadmap of the area in which they work.
There is also an increasing use of GPS driven navigational systems in wealthier countries.
In London, despite the complex and haphazard road layout, such aids have only recently been employed by a small number of 'black cab' taxi (as opposed to minicab) drivers.
Instead, they are required to undergo a demanding process of learning and testing called The Knowledge.
This typically takes around three years and equips them with a detailed command of 25,000 streets within central London, major routes outside this area, and all buildings and other destinations to which passengers may ask to be taken.
Taxicabs have been both criticized for creating pollution and also praised as an environmentally responsible alternative to private car use.
One study, published in the journal Atmospheric Environment in January 2006, showed that the level of pollution that Londoners are exposed to differs according to the mode of transport that they use.
When in the back seat of a taxicab people were exposed the most, while walking exposing people to the lowest amount of pollution.
In Australia, nearly all taxis run on LPG, as well as the growing fleet of hybrids.
Argentina and the main cities of Brazil have large fleets of taxis running on natural gas.
Many Brazilian taxis are flexible-fuel vehicles running on sugarcane ethanol, and some are equipped to run on either natural gas or as a flex-fuel.
At least two Brazilian car makers sell these type of bi-fuel vehicles.
Malaysia and Singapore have many of their taxicabs running on compressed natural gas (CNG).
San Francisco became one of the first cities to introduce hybrids for taxi service in 2005, with a fleet of 15 Ford Escape Hybrids, and by 2009 the original Escape Hybrids were retired after 480,000 km (300,000 mi) per vehicle.
In 2007 the city approved the Clean Air Taxi Grant Program in order to encourage cab companies to purchase alternative fuel vehicles, by providing incentives of US$2,000 per new alternative fuel vehicle on a first-come, first-served basis.
Out of a total of 1,378 eligible vehicles (wheelchair-accessible taxi-vans are excluded)
788 are alternative fuel vehicles, representing 57% of the San Francisco's taxicab fleet by March 2010.
Gasoline-electric hybrids accounted for 657 green taxis and compressed natural gas vehicles for 131.
As of mid-2009 New York City had 2,019 hybrid taxis and 12 clean diesel vehicles, representing 15% of New York's 13,237 taxis in service, the most in any city in North America.
At this time owners began retiring its original hybrid fleet after 480,000 and 560,000 km (300,000 and 350,000 mi) per vehicle.
Two attempts by the Bloomberg Administration to implement policies to force the replacement of all New York's 13,000 taxis for hybrids by 2012 have been blocked by court rulings.
Chicago is following New York City's lead by proposing a mandate for Chicago's entire fleet of 6,700 taxicabs to become hybrid by 1 January 2014.
As of 2008 Chicago's fleet had only 50 hybrid taxicabs.
In 2008 Boston mandated that its entire taxi fleet must be converted to hybrids by 2015.
Arlington, Virginia also has a small fleet of 85 environmentally friendly hybrid cabs introduced in early 2008.
The green taxi expansion is part of a county campaign known as Fresh AIRE, or Arlington Initiative to Reduce Emissions, and included a new all-hybrid taxi company called EnviroCAB, which became the first all-hybrid taxicab fleet in the United States, and the first carbon-negative taxicab company in the world A similar all-hybrid taxicab company, Clean Air Cab, was launched in Phoenix, Arizona in October 2009.
In Japan, electric taxicabs are becoming increasingly popular.
In 2009, battery-swap company Better Place teamed with the Japanese government to trial a fleet of electric taxis with the Better Place battery-swap system in Yokohama.
In 2010, the taxi company Hinomaru Linousine Company launched two Mitsubishi i MiEV electric taxicabs in Tokyo.
Both taxicabs had female drivers and were branded under ZeRO TAXI livery.
Hybrid taxis are becoming more and more common in Canada, with all new taxis in British Columbia being hybrids, or other fuel efficient vehicles, such as the Toyota Prius or Toyota Corolla.
Hybrids such as the Ford Escape Hybrid are slowly being added to the taxicab fleet in Mexico City.
Other cities where taxi service is available with hybrid vehicles include Tokyo, London, Sydney, Rome and Singapore.
Seoul introduced the first LPI hybrid taxi in December 2009.
The internal combustion engine runs on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a fuel.
In 2010 Beijing, China introduced electric taxis.
A trial run began in March 2010 with taxis being cheaper than their regular gasoline counterparts.
The Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association (TLPA) was established in 1917 in the United States, and is a non-profit trade association of and for the private passenger transportation industry.
Today its membership spans the globe and includes 1,100 taxicab companies, executive sedan and limousine services, airport shuttle fleets, non-emergency medical transportation companies, and paratransit services.
In April 2011, TLPA announced a nationwide "Transportation on Patrol" initiative.
The TOP program gives local police departments the materials they need to train volunteer taxi drivers to be good witnesses and watch out for criminal behavior.
Taxicab drivers are at risk for homicide at a far higher rate than the general working population in the United States (7.4 per 100,000 and 0.37 per 100,000, respectively).
In efforts to reduce homicides, bulletproof partitions were introduced in many taxicabs in the 1990s, and in the 21st century, security cameras were added to many taxicabs.
Security cameras have been shown to be more effective when implemented by cities and not taxicab companies.
Cab drivers also work together to protect one another both from physical threats and passengers who refuse to pay.
Also, in some countries, it is reported that taxi drivers involve in more unsafe driving behaviors.
Taxi drivers' feelings about their occupation, including traffic chaos, social prestige, economic pressure, and job satisfaction, may impact on the subsequent driving behaviors.
the demand for taxi services increases, as the prices fall and the quality improves.
However, there appears to be a consensus that taxi deregulation has been less impressive than advocates had hoped.
Possible reasons include overestimation of what deregulation could deliver and insufficiently thorough deregulation Some also emphasize that the strong cab-driver subculture, itself, ("The Last American Cowboys"), provides its own form of informal regulation.
Deregulation advocates may claim that the taxi service level increases most in the poorest sections of the city.
The effect is highest in peak hours and bad weather, when the demand is highest.
cities save money, as they do not have to plan and enforce regulation.
In nearly all deregulating cities the number of taxis increased, more people were employed as drivers, and deregulation advocates claim needs were better satisfied.
Existing taxi companies may try to limit competition by potential new entrants.
For example, in New York City the monopoly advantage for taxi license holders was $590 million in the early 1980s.
The city has 1,400 fewer licenses than in 1937.
Proponents of deregulation argue that the main losers are the car-less poor and disabled people.
Taxi owners form a strong lobby network that marginalizes drivers and taxi users.
It also pays local government officials to uphold taxi regulation.
The regulators usually do not wish to rise against the taxi-owner lobby.
The politicians do not want taxi drivers to have a negative opinion of them.
Taxi deregulation proponents claims that immigrants and other poor minorities suffer most from taxi regulation, because the work requires relatively little education.
Regulation makes entrance to the taxi business particularly difficult for them.
People who are elderly, disabled, housewives and poor use taxis more often than others.
According to Moore and Rose, it is better to address potential problems of deregulation directly instead of regulating the number of taxi licences.
For example, if the regulators want to increase safety, they should make safety statutes or publish a public list of safe taxi operators.
Proponents of deregulation also claim that if officials want to regulate prices they should standardize the measures rather than command prices.
For example, they may require that any distance tariffs are set for the first 1/5 miles and then for every subsequent 1/3 miles, to make it easier to compare the prices of different taxis.
They should not prohibit other pricing than distance pricing.
Deregulation advocates claim that regulators only have a very limited information on the market.
Black market taxis often have problems with safety, poor customer service, and fares.
This situation is made worse because customer who patronize such taxis cannot complain to the police or media.
However, proponent of taxi deregulation argue that when these illegal taxis become legalized, their behavior will improve and complaints to officials about these formerly illegal taxis would be allowed.
Taxi companies claim that deregulation may lead to an unstable taxi market.
However, one pro-deregulation study by Kitch, Isaacson and Kasper claims that the previous argument is a myth because it ignores the U.S. free taxi competition up to 1929.
Some deregulation proponents are less opposed to airport taxi regulation than to regulation of other taxi services.
They argue that if an airport regulates prices for taxis in its taxi queues, such regulation has fewer disadvantages than citywide regulation.
An airport may determine prices or organize different queues for taxi services of different qualities and prices.
It can be argued whether rules set by the owner of an airport are regulation or just a business model.
Proponents of deregulation argue that partial deregulation is the cause of many cases of deregulation failing to achieve desirable results in United States cities.
Many U.S. cities retained regulations on prices and services while allowing for free entrance to taxi business.
Deregulation advocates argue that this prevented market mechanisms from solving information problems because new entrants have found it difficult to win new customers using new services or cheap prices.
Also, ride-sharing has often been prohibited.
Often officials have also prohibited pricing that would have made short rides in sparsely populated areas profitable.
Thus drivers have refused to take such customers.
Therefore, partial deregulation is not always enough to enhance the situation.
One study claims that deregulation was applied to a too small area.
In the taxi regulation report by U.S. FTC it was concluded that there are not grounds for limiting the number of taxi companies and cars.
These limitations cause a disproportionate burden on low income people.
It is better to increase the pay for unprofitable areas than to force the taxis to serve these areas.
According to the report, the experience on free entry and price competition are mainly positive: prices have fallen, waiting times were shortened, the market shares of the biggest companies have fallen, and city councils have saved time from licensing and fare setting.
However, the airports should either set their own price ceilings or allow for price competition by altering the queue system.
Opponents of taxi deregulation argue that deregulation will result in high taxi driver turnover rates which may cause the number of less-qualified taxi drivers to increase, dishonest business practices such as price gouging (especially on airport routes) and circuitous routing, and poor customer service.
A Connecticut General Assembly report argues that deregulation fails to cause price decreases because taxi passengers typically do not price comparison shop when searching for taxicabs, and that fares usually increased with deregulation because the higher supply of taxis caused drivers' earning potential to decrease.
This report claims that deregulation resulted in dramatically increased taxi supply, especially at already overserved airport locations, fare increases in every city, and an increase in short-trip refusals by taxicab drivers.
This report argues that deregulation has led to undesirable results in several American cities.
Seattle deregulated taxis in 1980, resulting in a high supply of taxicabs, variable rates, price gouging, short-haul refusals, poor treatment of passengers.
As a result, Seattle re-regulated in 1984, reinstating a restriction on taxicab licenses and fare controls.
In St. Louis, deregulation produced a 35% rise in taxi fares, and taxicab drivers complained of waiting hours at airports for customers at taxicab stands.
Taxicab companies claimed they increased fares in order to make up for lost competition resulting from the increased supply of taxis.
As a result, the St. Louis City Council froze new taxicab licenses in 2002.
A study of the deregulation of taxis in Sweden in 1991 showed that the taxicab supply increased, but average fares also increased in almost all cases.
Specifically, average fares per hour increased for all trips.
Average fares also increased for fares calculated by distance (per kilometer) in almost every category studied – for all customer-paid trips in municipalities of all 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) and increased for municipality-paid trips in small and large municipalities; fares only decreased for municipality-paid trips in medium-sized municipalities that were calculated per kilometer.
Deregulation also resulted in decreased taxicab productivity and decreased taxi-company revenues.
This study concluded that deregulation resulted in increased fares especially in rural areas and the authors argued that the increased fares were due to low taxi company revenues after deregulation.
Taxi companies claim that deregulation would cause problems, raise prices and lower service level on certain hours or in certain places.
The medallion system  has been defended by some experts.
They argue that the medallion system is similar to a brand-name capital asset and enforces quality of service because quality service results in higher ridership, thus increasing the value of owning the medallion.
They argue that issuing new medallions would decrease the medallion value and thus the incentive for the medallion owner to provide quality service or comply with city regulations.
They also argue that the medallion may be preferable to alternate systems of regulation (such as fines, required bonds with seizures of interest payments on those bonds for violations, or licensing of all would-be taxis with revocation of that license for violations) because fines are difficult to collect, license revocation may not be a sufficient deterrent for profitable violations such as price cheating, and because using penalties on bond interest payments give regulators an incentive to impose penalties to collect revenue (rather than for legitimate violations).
Medallions do not earn interest and thus inappropriate seizures of interest by regulators is not possible.
The results of taxi deregulation in specific cities has varied widely.
A study of taxi deregulation in nine United States cities found that the number of taxi firms increased, but large incumbent firms continued to dominate all but one of the nine cities.
The taxi prices did not fall in real terms, but increased in every city studied.
Turnover was concentrated among small operators (usually one-cab operators); little turnover occurred among medium and large new firms and no exit by a large incumbent firm occurred since deregulation.
Productivity decreased by at least one-third in all four cities for which sufficient data was obtainable; the authors argued that decreases of this magnitude in productivity have serious economic consequences for taxi drivers, by shifting the industry from employee drivers to lease drivers and causing the average taxi driver to earn a lower income.
Innovation in service did not occur in the deregulated cities because such innovations (especially shared-ride service) were doubted by taxi operators to be justified by demand and because the operators viewed that they would cause a net decrease in revenue.
Discounts were offered in certain deregulated cities; however, these discounts were small (10% typically) and were also offered in some regulated cities.
The study found a lack of service innovation and little change in level of service despite the increased number of taxicabs.
In Japan, taxi deregulation resulted in modest decreases in taxi fares (primarily among long-distance trips); however, Japanese taxi fares are still very high (still the highest in the world).
Also, taxi driver incomes decreased, and the earnings of taxi companies also decreased substantially.
Deregulation failed to increase taxicab ridership enough to compensate taxi companies for those losses.
The burden of deregulation fell disproportionately on taxi drivers because taxi companies increased the number of taxis rented to drivers (to make more money from rental fees), which resulted in stiff competition among drivers, decreasing their earnings.
Transportation professor Seiji Abe of Kansai University considered deregulation to be a failure in the Japanese taxi industry (despite what he considers success in other Japanese industries).
In the Netherlands, taxi deregulation in 2000 failed to reach policy objectives of strengthening the role of the taxi in the overall Dutch transport system.
Instead, the deregulation resulted in unanticipated fare increases (not decreases) in large cities, and bad driver behavior became a serious problem.
Local authorities had lost their say in the market due to the deregulation, and thus were unable to correct these problems.
In South Africa, taxi deregulation has resulted in the emergence of taxi cartels which carry out acts of gun violence against rival cartels in attempts to monopolize desirable routes.
In South Africa, taxis were deregulated in 1987, resulting in fierce competition among new drivers, who then organized into rival cartels in the absence of government regulation, and which used violence and gangland tactics to protect and expand their territories.
These "taxi wars" have resulted in between 120 and 330 deaths annually since deregulation.
These taxi cartels have engaged in anticompetitive price-fixing.
In New Zealand taxi deregulation increased the supply of taxi services and initially decreased the prices remarkably in big cities, whereas the effects in smaller cities were small.
In Ireland, taxi deregulation decreased waiting times so much that the liberalization became very popular among the public.
The number of companies was increased and the quality of cars and drives did not fall.
Some have argued that the regulation should be completely abolished, not just cut down.
Minister Alan Kelly held a review of Ireland's taxi industry after Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ broadcast an investigation into the taxi industry 10 years after de-regulation.
In Finland taxi fares rose 13% after 2018 deregulation.
In a piston engine, either a timing belt (also called a cambelt) or timing chain or set of timing gears is a perishable component used to synchronize the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft.
This synchronisation ensures that the engine's valves open and close at the correct times in relation to the position of the pistons.
In most piston engines, the camshaft(s) are mechanically connected to the crankshaft.
The crankshaft drives the camshaft (via a timing belt, timing chain or gears), which in turn actuates the intake and exhaust valves.
These valves allow the engine to inhale air (or an air/fuel mixture) and exhale the exhaust gasses.
The most common devices to transfer the drive are toothed rubber belts, metal timing chains or a set of gears.
The teeth of the belt/chain/gears mesh with both the crankshaft and camshaft(s), thereby synchronising their motion.
In many older overhead valve engines, the camshaft is located in the block near the crankshaft, therefore a simple gear system is often used to drive the camshaft.
Overhead camshaft engines mostly use timing belts or timing chains, since these are better suited to transferring drive over larger distances.
Timing belts were common on mass-production cars until the 1970s and 1980s, however since the 1990s timing chains have become more common due to the replacement intervals required when using timing belts.
The phrase "timing belt" usually refers to a rubber toothed belt.
The advantages of timing belts are typically a lower cost, reduced friction losses, less noise and that belts traditionally do not require lubrication.
The main disadvantage is that belts wear over time, therefore belt replacement is recommended at specific intervals.
Replacement of the engine's water pump at the same time is often recommended, since the water pump is also subject to wear and easily accessed during the replacement of the timing belt.
Timing belts are typically located in front of the engine and are often behind a cover for protection against dust and debris.
However a few engines since 2008 have used "wet timing belts", whereby the belt is lubricated by engine oil to reduce friction.
In some engine designs the timing belt may also be used to drive other components, such as the water pump and oil pump.
A timing belt is typically made from rubber, although some belts are instead made from polyurethane or neoprene.
The structure of the belt is reinforced with corded fibres (acting as tension members) and the toothed surface is reinforced with a fabric covering.
Rubber degrades with higher temperatures, and with contact with motor oil.
Thus the life expectancy of a timing belt is lowered in hot or leaky engines.
Also, the life of the reinforcing cords is also affected by water and antifreeze, so it is important that belt that can be exposed to water is able to drain the water away quickly.
Older belts have trapezoid shaped teeth leading to high rates of tooth wear.
Newer manufacturing techniques allow for curved teeth that are quieter and last longer.
Manufacturer-specification timing belts may stretch at high rpm, retarding the cam and therefore the ignition.
Stronger aftermarket belts will not stretch and the timing is preserved.
When designing the timing belt, a wider belt increases its strength however a narrower belt reduces weight and friction.
The usual failure modes of timing belts are either stripped teeth (which leaves a smooth section of belt where the drive cog will slip) or delamination and unraveling of the fiber cores.
Breakage of the belt, because of the nature of the high tensile fibers, is uncommon.
Often overlooked, debris and dirt that mix with oil and grease can slowly wear at the belt and materials advancing the wear process, causing premature belt failure.
Toothed belts were invented in the early 1940s, for use in textile mills.
The first known automobile engine to use a timing belt was the American 1954 Devin-Panhard racing car, used an engine converted from pushrods to overhead camshafts through the use of a toothed belt made by the Gilmer Company.
This car won the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA)
National Championship in 1956.
The 1962 Glas 1004 was the first mass-produced vehicle to use a timing belt.
The 1966 Pontiac OHC Six engine was the first US mass-produced vehicle to use a timing belt, while the 1966 Fiat Twin Cam engine was the first mass-produced engine to use a timing belt with twin camshafts.
Metal timing chains have become more widespread in car engines produced since the 1990s, due to the lack of the regular maintenance task of replacing a rubber timing belt.
While the chains themselves are subject to minimal wear, lubrication of the chain or failure of the tensioner and chain guides can cause maintenance issues.
By contrast to rubber-based timing belts which give no indication of snapping while one is driving, early symptoms of a timing chain system becoming worn exist, and these include a rattling noise from the front of the engine.
Most pushrod engines, where the crankshaft and camshaft are very close together, use a short chain drive rather than a direct gear drive.
This is because gear drives suffer from frequent torque reversal as the cam profiles "kick back" against the drive from the crank, leading to excessive noise and wear.
Timing gears are used in various overhead valve engines, due to the close proximity of the camshaft to the crankshaft.
Fiber or nylon covered gears, with more resilience, are often used instead of steel gears where direct drive is used.
However, commercial engines and aircraft engines use steel gears only, as these other materials can fail suddenly and without warning.
Failure of the timing system will prevent an engine from running.
Many modern cars use  interference engines, which can suffer catastrophic damage in the event of timing system failure, since the loss of synchronization between the crankshaft and the camshaft will cause the valves to collide with the pistons.
Aside from the belt/chain itself, also common is a failure of the tensioner, and/or the various gear and idler bearings, causing the belt/chain to derail.
Furthermore, in engines where the timing belt drives the water pump, failure of the water pump can cause the pump to seize, which can break the timing belt or chain.
For this reason, timing belts and chains are often sold as part of a kit with the water pump, tensioner, and idler pulleys so that these parts can be replaced to prevent timing belt or chain failure due to failure of these parts.
Richard Trevithick (13 April 1771 – 22 April 1833) was a British inventor and mining engineer.
The son of a mining captain, and born in the mining heartland of Cornwall, Trevithick was immersed in mining and engineering from an early age.
He was an early pioneer of steam-powered road and rail transport, and his most significant contributions were the development of the first high-pressure steam engine and the first working railway steam locomotive.
The world's first locomotive-hauled railway journey took place on 21 February 1804, when Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the Penydarren Ironworks, in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales.
Turning his interests abroad Trevithick also worked as a mining consultant in Peru and later explored parts of Costa Rica.
Throughout his professional career he went through many ups and downs and at one point faced financial ruin, also suffering from the strong rivalry of many mining and steam engineers of the day.
During the prime of his career he was a well-known and highly respected figure in mining and engineering, but near the end of his life he fell out of the public eye.
Trevithick was extremely strong and was a champion Cornish wrestler.
Richard Trevithick was born at Tregajorran (in the parish of Illogan), between Camborne and Redruth, in the heart of one of the rich mineral-mining areas of Cornwall.
He was the youngest-but-one child and the only boy in a family of six children.
He was very tall for the era at 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), as well as athletic and concentrated more on sport than schoolwork.
Sent to the village school at Camborne, he did not take much advantage of the education provided; one of his school masters described him as "a disobedient, slow, obstinate, spoiled boy, frequently absent and very inattentive".
An exception was arithmetic, for which he had an aptitude, though arriving at the correct answers by unconventional means.
Trevithick was the son of mine "captain" Richard Trevithick (1735–1797) and of miner's daughter Ann Teague (died 1810).
As a child he would watch steam engines pump water from the deep tin and copper mines in Cornwall.
For a time he was a neighbour of William Murdoch, the steam carriage pioneer, and would have been influenced by Murdoch’s experiments with steam-powered road locomotion.
Trevithick first went to work at the age of 19 at the East Stray Park Mine.
He was enthusiastic and quickly gained the status of a consultant, unusual for such a young person.
He was popular with the miners because of the respect they had for his father.
Jane's father, John Harvey, formerly a blacksmith from Carnhell Green, formed the local foundry, Harveys of Hayle.
His company became famous worldwide for building huge stationary "beam" engines for pumping water, usually from mines.
Up to this time such steam engines were of the condensing or atmospheric type, originally invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, which also became known as low-pressure engines.
James Watt, on behalf of his partnership with Matthew Boulton, held a number of patents for improving the efficiency of Newcomen's engine—including the "separate condenser patent", which proved the most contentious.
Trevithick became engineer at the Ding Dong Mine in 1797, and there (in conjunction with Edward Bull) he pioneered the use of high-pressure steam.
He worked on building and modifying steam engines to avoid the royalties due to Watt on the separate condenser patent.
Boulton & Watt served an injunction on him at Ding Dong, and posted it "on the minestuffs" and "most likely on the door" of the Count (Account) House which, although now a ruin, is the only surviving building from Trevithick's time there.
He also experimented with the plunger-pole pump, a type of pump—with a beam engine—used widely in Cornwall's tin mines, in which he reversed the plunger to change it into a water-power engine.
As his experience grew, he realised that improvements in boiler technology now permitted the safe production of high-pressure steam, which could move a piston in a steam engine on its own account, instead of using pressure near to atmospheric, in a condensing engine.
He was not the first to think of so-called "strong steam" or steam of about 30 psi (210 kPa).
William Murdoch had developed and demonstrated a model steam carriage, initially in 1784, and demonstrated it to Trevithick at his request in 1794.
In fact, Trevithick lived next door to Murdoch in Redruth in 1797 and 1798.
Oliver Evans in the U.S. had also concerned himself with the concept, but there is no indication that his ideas had ever come to Trevithick's attention.
Independently of this, Arthur Woolf was experimenting with higher pressures whilst working as the Chief Engineer of the Griffin Brewery (proprietors Meux and Reid).
This was an Engine designed by Hornblower and Maberly, and the proprietors were keen to have the best steam engine in London.
Around 1796, Woolf believed he could save substantial amounts of coal consumption.
Trevithick began building his first models of high-pressure (meaning a few atmospheres) steam engines – first a stationary one and subsequently one attached to a road carriage.
A double-acting cylinder was used, with steam distribution by means of a four-way valve.
Exhaust steam was vented via a vertical pipe or chimney straight into the atmosphere, thus avoiding a condenser and any possible infringements of Watt's patent.
The linear motion was directly converted into circular motion via a crank instead of using a more cumbersome beam.
Trevithick built a full-size steam road locomotive in 1801, on a site near present-day Fore Street in Camborne.
(A steam wagon built in 1770 by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot may have an earlier claim.)
Trevithick named his carriage Puffing Devil and on Christmas Eve that year, he demonstrated it by successfully carrying six passengers up Fore Street and then continuing on up Camborne Hill, from Camborne Cross, to the nearby village of Beacon.
His cousin and associate, Andrew Vivian, steered the machine.
It inspired the popular Cornish folk song "Camborne Hill".
During further tests, Trevithick's locomotive broke down three days later after passing over a gully in the road.
The vehicle was left under some shelter with the fire still burning whilst the operators retired to a nearby public house for a meal of roast goose and drinks.
Meanwhile, the water boiled off, the engine overheated and the machine burned, destroying it.
Trevithick did not consider this a serious setback, but rather operator error.
In 1802 Trevithick took out a patent for his high-pressure steam engine.
To prove his ideas, he built a stationary engine at the Coalbrookdale Company's works in Shropshire in 1802, forcing water to a measured height to measure the work done.
The engine ran at forty piston strokes a minute, with an unprecedented boiler pressure of 145 psi (1,000 kPa).
In 1802 the Coalbrookdale Company in Shropshire built a rail locomotive for him, but little is known about it, including whether or not it actually ran.
The death of a company workman in an accident involving the engine is said to have caused the company to not proceed to running it on their existing railway.
To date, the only known information about it comes from a drawing preserved at the Science Museum, London, together with a letter written by Trevithick to his friend Davies Giddy.
The design incorporated a single horizontal cylinder enclosed in a return-flue boiler.
A flywheel drove the wheels on one side through spur gears, and the axles were mounted directly on the boiler, with no frame.
On the drawing, the piston-rod, guide-bars and cross-head are located directly above the firebox door, thus making the engine extremely dangerous to fire while moving.
Furthermore, the first drawing by Daniel Shute indicates that the locomotive ran on a plateway with a track gauge of 3 ft (914 mm).
This is the drawing used as the basis of all images and replicas of the later "Pen-y-darren" locomotive, as no plans for that locomotive have survived.
The Puffing Devil was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and would have been of little practical use.
He built another steam-powered road vehicle in 1803, called the London Steam Carriage, which attracted much attention from the public and press when he drove it that year in London from Holborn to Paddington and back.
It was uncomfortable for passengers and proved more expensive to run than a horse-drawn carriage, and was abandoned.
In 1831, Trevithick gave evidence to a Parliamentary select committee on steam carriages.
Also in 1803, one of Trevithick's stationary pumping engines in use at Greenwich exploded, killing four men.
Although Trevithick considered the explosion to be caused by a case of careless operation rather than design error, the incident was exploited relentlessly by James Watt and Matthew Boulton (competitors and promoters of the low-pressure engine) who highlighted the perceived risks of using high-pressure steam.
Trevithick's response was to incorporate two safety valves into future designs, only one of which could be adjusted by the operator.
The adjustable valve comprised a disc covering a small hole at the top of the boiler above the water level in the steam chest.
The force exerted by the steam pressure was equalised by an opposite force created by a weight attached to a pivoted lever.
The position of the weight on the lever was adjustable thus allowing the operator to set the maximum steam pressure.
Trevithick also added a fusible plug of lead, positioned in the boiler just below the minimum safe water level.
Under normal operation the water temperature could not exceed that of boiling water and kept the lead below its melting point.
If the water ran low, it exposed the lead plug, and the cooling effect of the water was lost.
The temperature would then rise sufficiently to melt the lead, releasing steam into the fire, reducing the boiler pressure and providing an audible alarm in sufficient time for the operator to damp the fire, and let the boiler cool before damage could occur.
He also introduced the hydraulic testing of boilers, and the use of a mercury manometer to indicate the pressure.
In 1802, Trevithick built one of his high-pressure steam engines to drive a hammer at the Penydarren Ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan.
With the assistance of Rees Jones, an employee of the iron works, and under the supervision of Samuel Homfray, the proprietor, Trevithick mounted the engine on wheels and turned it into a locomotive.
In 1803, Trevithick sold the patents for his locomotives to Samuel Homfray.
Homfray was so impressed with Trevithick's locomotive that he made a bet of 500 guineas with another ironmaster, Richard Crawshay, that Trevithick's steam locomotive could haul ten tons of iron along the Merthyr Tramroad from Penydarren (51°45′03″N 3°22′33″W) to Abercynon (51°38′44″N 3°19′27″W), a distance of 9.75 miles (15.69 km).
On 21 February 1804, amid great interest from the public, it successfully carried 10 tons of iron, five wagons and 70 men the full distance in 4 hours and 5 minutes, at an average speed of approximately 2.4 mph (3.9 km/h).
As well as Homfray, Crawshay and the passengers, other witnesses included Mr. Giddy, a respected patron of Trevithick, and an "engineer from the Government".
The engineer from the government was probably a safety inspector, who would have been particularly interested in the boiler's ability to withstand high steam pressures.
The configuration of the Pen-y-Darren engine differed from the Coalbrookdale engine.
The cylinder was moved to the other end of the boiler so that the fire door was out of the way of the moving parts.
That obviously also involved putting the crankshaft at the chimney end.
The locomotive comprised a boiler with a single return flue mounted on a four-wheel frame.
At one end, a single cylinder, with very long stroke, was mounted partly in the boiler, and a piston rod crosshead ran out along a slidebar, an arrangement that looked like a giant trombone.
There was only one cylinder, which was coupled to a large flywheel mounted on one side.
The rotational inertia of the flywheel would even out the movement that was transmitted to a central cog-wheel that was, in turn connected to the driving wheels.
It used a high-pressure cylinder without a condenser.
The exhaust steam was sent up the chimney, which assisted the draught through the fire, increasing the  efficiency of the engine even more.
The bet was won.
Despite many people's doubts, it had been shown that, provided that the gradient was sufficiently gentle, it was possible to successfully haul heavy carriages along a smooth iron road using the adhesive weight alone of a suitably heavy and powerful steam locomotive.
Trevithick's was probably the first to do so; but some of the short cast iron plates of the tramroad broke under the locomotive, because they were intended only to support the lighter axle load of horse-drawn wagons.
Consequently, the tramroad returned to horse power after the initial test run.
Homfray was pleased he won his bet.
The engine was placed on blocks and reverted to its original stationary job of driving hammers.
In modern-day Merthyr Tydfil, behind the monument to Trevithick's locomotive, lies a stone wall, the sole remainder of the former boundary wall of Homfray's Penydarren House.
A full-scale working reconstruction of the Pen-y-darren locomotive was commissioned in 1981 and delivered to the Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum in Cardiff.
When that closed, the locomotive was moved to the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea.
Several times a year, it is run on a 40 m (130 ft) length of railway outside the museum.
Christopher Blackett, proprietor of the Wylam colliery near Newcastle, heard of the success in Wales and wrote to Trevithick asking for locomotive designs.
These were sent to John Whitfield at Gateshead, Trevithick's agent, who in 1804 built what was probably the first locomotive to have flanged wheels.
Blackett was using wooden rails for his tramway and, once again, Trevithick's machine was to prove too heavy for its track.
In 1808 Trevithick publicised his steam railway locomotive expertise by building a new locomotive called Catch Me Who Can, built for him by John Hazledine and John Urpeth Rastrick at Bridgnorth in Shropshire, and named by Davies Giddy's daughter.
The configuration differed from the previous locomotives in that the cylinder was mounted vertically and drove a pair of wheels directly without a flywheel or gearing.
This was probably Trevithick's fourth locomotive, after those used at Coalbrookdale, Pen-y-darren ironworks, and the Wylam colliery.
He ran it on a circular track just south of the present-day Euston Square tube station in London.
The site in Bloomsbury has recently been identified archaeologically as that occupied by the Chadwick Building, part of University College London.
Admission to the "steam circus" was one shilling including a ride and it was intended to show that rail travel was faster than by horse.
This venture also suffered from weak tracks and public interest was limited.
Trevithick was disappointed by the response and designed no more railway locomotives.
It was not until 1812 that twin-cylinder steam locomotives, built by Matthew Murray in Holbeck, successfully started replacing horses for hauling coal wagons on the edge railed, rack and pinion Middleton Railway from Middleton colliery to Leeds, West Yorkshire.
Robert Vazie, another Cornish engineer, was selected by the Thames Archway Company in 1805 to drive a tunnel under the River Thames at Rotherhithe.
Vazie encountered serious problems with water influx, and had got no further than sinking the end shafts when the directors called in Trevithick for consultation.
The directors agreed to pay Trevithick £1000 (the equivalent of £100,528 in 2023) if he could successfully complete the tunnel, a length of 1,220 feet (370 m).
In August 1807, he began driving a small pilot tunnel or driftway 5 feet (1.5 m) high tapering from 2 feet 6 inches (0.76 m) at the top to 3 feet (0.91 m) at the bottom.
By 23 December, after it had progressed 950 feet (290 m), progress was delayed after a sudden inrush of water; and only one month later on 26 January 1808, at 1,040 feet (320 m), a more serious inrush occurred.
The tunnel was flooded; Trevithick, being the last to leave, was nearly drowned.
Clay was dumped on the river bed to seal the hole, and the tunnel was drained, but mining was now more difficult.
Progress stalled, and a few of the directors attempted to discredit Trevithick, but the quality of his work was eventually upheld by two colliery engineers from the North of England.
Despite suggesting various building techniques to complete the project, including a submerged cast iron tube, Trevithick's links with the company ceased and the project was never actually completed.
The first successful tunnel under the Thames was started by Sir Marc Isambard Brunel in 1823, 0.75 miles (1,200 m) upstream, assisted by his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel (who also nearly died in a tunnel collapse).
Marc Brunel finally completed it in 1843, the delays being due to problems with funding.
Trevithick's suggestion of a submerged tube approach was successfully implemented for the first time across the Detroit River between Michigan in the United States and Ontario in Canada with the construction of the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel, under the engineering supervision of The New York Central Railway's engineering vice president, William J Wilgus.
Construction began in 1903 and was completed in 1910.
The Detroit–Windsor Tunnel which was completed in 1930 for automotive traffic, and the tunnel under the Hong Kong Harbour were also submerged-tube designs.
Trevithick went on to research other projects to exploit his high-pressure steam engines: boring brass for cannon manufacture, stone crushing, rolling mills, forge hammers, blast furnace blowers as well as the traditional mining applications.
He also built a barge powered by paddle wheels and several dredgers.
Trevithick saw opportunities in London and persuaded his wife and four children reluctantly to join him in 1808 for two and a half years lodging first in Rotherhithe and then in Limehouse.
In 1808 Trevithick entered a partnership with Robert Dickinson (businessman), a West India merchant.
Dickinson supported several of Trevithick's patents.
The first of these was the Nautical Labourer; a steam tug with a floating crane propelled by paddle wheels.
However, it did not meet the fire regulations for the docks, and the Society of Coal Whippers, worried about losing their livelihood, even threatened the life of Trevithick.
Another patent was for the installation of iron tanks in ships for storage of cargo and water instead of in wooden casks.
A small works was set up at Limehouse to manufacture them, employing three men.
The tanks were also used to raise sunken wrecks by placing them under the wreck and creating buoyancy by pumping them full of air.
In 1810 a wreck near Margate was raised in this way but there was a dispute over payment and Trevithick was driven to cut the lashings loose and let it sink again.
In 1809, Trevithick worked on various ideas on improvements for ships: iron floating docks, iron ships, telescopic iron masts, improved ship structures, iron buoys and using heat from the ships boilers for cooking.
In May 1810 Trevithick caught typhoid and nearly died.
By September, he had recovered sufficiently to travel back to Cornwall by ship, and in February 1811 he and Dickinson were declared bankrupt.
They were not discharged until 1814, Trevithick having paid off most of the partnership debts from his own funds.
In about 1812 Trevithick designed the ‘Cornish boiler’.
These were horizontal, cylindrical boilers with a single internal fire tube or flue passing horizontally through the middle.
Hot exhaust gases from the fire passed through the flue thus increasing the surface area heating the water and improving efficiency.
These types were installed in the Boulton and Watt pumping engines at Dolcoath and more than doubled their efficiency.
Again in 1812, he installed a new 'high-pressure' experimental condensing steam engine at Wheal Prosper.
This became known as the Cornish engine, and was the most efficient in the world at that time.
Other Cornish engineers contributed to its development but Trevithick's work was predominant.
In the same year he installed another high-pressure engine, though non-condensing, in a threshing machine at the Trewithen Estate, a farm in Probus, Cornwall.
It was very successful and proved to be cheaper to run than the horses it replaced.
In use for 70 years, it was then retired to an exhibit at the Science Museum.
In 2023, the owners of the Trewithen Estate planned to redevelop their farm, which will also involve returning the historic Trevithick steam engine to its original location within the farm.
In one of Trevithick's more unusual projects, he attempted to build a 'recoil engine' similar to the aeolipile described by Hero of Alexandria in about AD 50.
Trevithick's engine comprised a boiler feeding a hollow axle to route the steam to a catherine wheel with two fine-bore steam jets on its circumference.
The first wheel was 15 feet (4.6 m) in diameter and a later attempt was 24 feet (7.3 m) in diameter.
To get any usable torque, steam had to issue from the nozzles at a very high velocity and in such large volume that it proved not to operate with adequate efficiency.
Today this would be recognised as a reaction turbine.
In 1811 draining water from the rich silver mines of Cerro de Pasco in Peru at an altitude of 4,330 metres (14,210 ft) posed serious problems for the man in charge, Francisco Uville.
The low-pressure condensing engines by Boulton and Watt developed so little power as to be useless at this altitude, and they could not be dismantled into sufficiently small pieces to be transported there along mule tracks.
Uville was sent to England to investigate using Trevithick's high-pressure steam engine.
He bought one for 20 guineas, transported it back and found it to work quite satisfactorily.
In 1813 Uville set sail again for England and, having fallen ill on the way, broke his journey via Jamaica.
When he had recovered he boarded the Falmouth packet ship 'Fox' coincidentally with one of Trevithick's cousins on board the same vessel.
Trevithick's home was just a few miles from Falmouth so Uville was able to meet him and tell him about the project.
On 20 October 1816 Trevithick left Penzance on the whaler ship Asp accompanied by a lawyer named Page and a boilermaker bound for Peru.
He was received by Uville with honour initially but relations soon broke down and Trevithick left in disgust at the accusations directed at him.
He travelled widely in Peru acting as a consultant on mining methods.
The government granted him certain mining rights and he found mining areas, but did not have the funds to develop them, with the exception of a copper and silver mine at Caxatambo.
After a time serving in the army of Simon Bolivar he returned to Caxatambo but due to the unsettled state of the country and presence of the Spanish army he was forced to leave the area and abandon £5,000 worth of ore ready to ship.
Uville died in 1818 and Trevithick soon returned to Cerro de Pasco to continue mining.
However, the war of liberation denied him several objectives.
Meanwhile, back in England, he was accused of neglecting his wife Jane and family in Cornwall.
After leaving Cerro de Pasco, Trevithick passed through Ecuador on his way to Bogotá in Colombia.
He arrived in Costa Rica in 1822 hoping to develop mining machinery.
He spent time looking for a practical route to transport ore and equipment, settling on using the San Juan River, the Sarapiqui River, and then a railway to cover the remaining distance.
In a biography his son wrote that Trevithick had in mind a steam-driven railway and not mule-driven.
The initial party comprised Trevithick, Scottish mining projector James Gerard, two schoolboys: José Maria Montealegre (a future president of Costa Rica) and his brother Mariano, whom Gerard intended to enrol at a small boarding school at Lauderdale House in Highgate (where Trevithick later made his temporary London home), and seven natives, three of whom returned home after guiding them through the first part of their journey.
The journey was treacherous – one of the party was drowned in a raging torrent and Trevithick was nearly killed on at least two occasions.
In the first he was saved from drowning by Gerard, and in the second he was nearly devoured by an alligator following a dispute with a local man whom he had in some way offended.
Still in the company of Gerard, he made his way to Cartagena where he chanced to meet Robert Stephenson who was himself on his way home from Colombia, following a failed three-year mining venture.
It had been many years since they last met (when Stephenson was just a baby), and the two men were judged by witnesses to their meeting to have little in common.
Despite this Stephenson gave Trevithick £50 to help his passage home.
Whilst Stephenson and Gerard booked passage via New York, Trevithick took ship direct to Falmouth, arriving there in October 1827 with few possessions other than the clothes he was wearing.
He never returned to Costa Rica.
Taking encouragement from earlier inventors who had achieved some successes with similar endeavours, Trevithick petitioned Parliament for a grant, but he was unsuccessful in acquiring one.
In 1829 he built a closed cycle steam engine followed by a vertical tubular boiler.
In 1830 he invented an early form of storage room heater.
It comprised a small fire tube boiler with a detachable flue which could be heated either outside or indoors with the flue connected to a chimney.
Once hot the hot water container could be wheeled to where heat was required and the issuing heat could be altered using adjustable doors.
To commemorate the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832 he designed a massive column to be 1,000 feet (300 m) high, being 100 feet (30 m) in diameter at the base tapering to 12 feet (3.7 m) at the top where a statue of a horse would have been mounted.
It was to be made of 1500 10-foot-square (3 m) pieces of cast iron and would have weighed 6,000 long tons (6,100 t; 6,700 short tons).
There was substantial public interest in the proposal, but it was never built.
About the same time he was invited to do some development work on an engine of a new vessel at Dartford by John Hall, the founder of J & E Hall Limited.
The work involved a reaction turbine for which Trevithick earned £1200.
He lodged at The Bull hotel in the High Street, Dartford, Kent.
After he had been working in Dartford for about a year, Trevithick was taken ill with pneumonia and had to retire to bed at the Bull Hotel, where he was lodging at the time.
Following a week's confinement in bed he died on the morning of 22 April 1833.
He was penniless, and no relatives or friends had attended his bedside during his illness.
His colleagues at Hall's works made a collection for his funeral expenses and acted as bearers.
They also paid a night watchman to guard his grave at night to deter grave robbers, as body snatching was common at that time.
Trevithick was buried in an unmarked grave in St Edmund's Burial Ground, East Hill, Dartford.
The burial ground closed in 1857, with the gravestones being removed in 1956–57.
A plaque marks the approximate spot believed to be the site of the grave.
The plaque lies on the side of the park, near the East Hill gate, and an unlinked path.
In Camborne, outside the public library, a statue by Leonard Stanford Merrifield depicting Trevithick holding one of his small-scale models was unveiled in 1932 by Prince George, Duke of Kent, in front of a crowd of thousands of local people.
On 17 March 2007, Dartford Borough Council invited the Chairman of the Trevithick Society, Phil Hosken, to unveil a Blue plaque at the Royal Victoria and Bull hotel (formerly The Bull) marking Trevithick's last years in Dartford and the place of his death in 1833.
The Blue Plaque is prominently displayed on the hotel's front facade.
There is also a plaque at Holy Trinity Church, Dartford.
The Cardiff University Engineering, Computer Science and Physics departments are based around the Trevithick Building which also holds the Trevithick Library, named after Richard Trevithick.
In Gower Street in London, on the wall of the University College building, an elaborate wall plaque carries the legend: "Close to this place Richard Trevithick (Born 1771 – Died 1833)
Pioneer of High Pressure Steam ran in the year 1808 the first steam locomotive to draw passengers."
It was erected by "The Trevithick Centenary Memorial Committee".
One of the oldest depictions of Saint Piran's Flag can be seen in a stained glass window at Westminster Abbey, 1888, commemorating Richard Trevithick.
The window depicts St Michael at the top and nine Cornish saints, Piran, Petroc, Pinnock, Germanus, Julian, Cyriacus, Constantine, Nonna and Geraint in tiers below.
The head of St Piran appears to be a portrait of Trevithick himself and the figure carries the banner of Cornwall.
There is a plaque and memorial situated in Abercynon, outside the fire station.
It says "In commemoration of the achievements of Richard Trevithick who having constructed the first steam locomotive did on February 21st 1804 successfully hail 10 tons of iron and numerous passengers along a tramroad from Merthyr to this precinct where was situated the loading point of the Glamorgan Canal".
There is also a building in Abercynon called Ty Trevithick (Trevithick House), named in his honour.
On Penydarren Road, Merthyr Tydfil there is a memorial on the site of the Penydarren Tramway.
The inscription reads "RICHARD TREVITHICK 1771-1833 PIONEER OF HIGH PRESSURE STEAM BUILT THE FIRST STEAM LOCOMOTIVE TO RUN ON RAILS.
ON FEBRUARY 21ST 1804
IT TRAVERSED THE SPOT ON WHICH
THIS MONUMENT STANDS ON ITS WAY TO ABERCYNON".
A short walk north of that is the (slightly misspelled) Trevethick Street, named after Trevithick.
A replica of Trevithick's first full-size steam road locomotive was first displayed at Camborne Trevithick Day 2001, the day chosen for the celebration of Trevithick's public demonstration of the use of high-pressure steam.
The team consisting of John Woodward, Mark Rivron and Sean Oliver, have continued to maintain and display the engine at various steam fairs across the country.
The Puffing Devil has proudly led the parade of steam engines at every subsequent Trevithick day up to and including 2014.
Trevithick Drive in Temple Hill, Dartford, was named after Richard Trevithick.
The Trevithick Society, a successor to industrial archaeology organizations that were initially formed to rescue the Levant winding engine from being scrapped, was named in honor of Richard Trevithick.
They publish a newsletter, a journal and many books on Cornish engines, the mining industry, engineers, and other industrial archaeological topics.
The active Trevithick Society is not to be confused with the former Trevithick Trust, registered by the Charity Commission in 1994 and removed (ceased to exist) in 2006.
The Trevithick Trust attracted grants and did work at various sites in Cornwall, including King Edward Mine.
There is also a street named after Trevithick in Merthyr Tydfil.
Richard Trevithick is celebrated in Camborne, Cornwall on Trevithick Day which is held annually on the last Saturday in April.
The day is a community festival with steam engines from all over the UK attending.
Towards the end of the day they parade through the streets of Camborne and steam past a statue of Richard Trevithick outside the Passmore Edwards building.
Harry Turtledove's alternate history short story "The Iron Elephant" has Richard Trevithick inventing his steam engine in 1782 and subsequently racing a mammoth-drawn train that it would in time come to supplant.
This character was born sometime before 1771, and is American rather than British, indicating he (alongside station master George Stephenson) is an analog (a common Turtledove plot device) rather than the historical figure.
The greatest legacy of Trevithick, of course, is that he set into motion the railway age, and proved that high pressure steam engines were the way forward from low pressure engines.
After him came George and Robert Stephenson who created viable locomotives and commercially viable railways, but they only built on what Trevithick laid down before them.
A throttle is a mechanism by which fluid flow is managed by constriction or obstruction.
An engine's power can be increased or decreased by the restriction of inlet gases (by the use of a throttle), but usually decreased.
The term throttle has come to refer, informally, to any mechanism by which the power or speed of an engine is regulated, such as a car's accelerator pedal.
What is often termed a throttle (in an aviation context) is also  called a thrust lever, particularly for jet engine powered aircraft.
For a steam locomotive, the valve which controls the steam is known as the regulator.
Modern engines of both types (gas and diesel) are commonly drive-by-wire systems where sensors monitor the driver controls and in response a computerized system controls the flow of fuel and air.
This means that the operator does not have direct control over the flow of fuel and air; the Engine Control Unit (ECU) can achieve better control in order to reduce emissions, maximize performance and adjust the engine idle to make a cold engine warm up faster or to account for eventual additional engine loads such as running air conditioning compressors in order to avoid engine stalls.
The throttle on a gasoline engine is typically a butterfly valve.
In a fuel-injected engine, the throttle valve is placed on the entrance of the intake manifold, or housed in the throttle body.
In a carbureted engine, it is found in the carburetor.
When a throttle is wide open, the intake manifold is usually at ambient atmospheric pressure.
When the throttle is partially closed, a manifold vacuum develops as the intake drops below ambient pressure.
The power output of a diesel engine is controlled by regulating the quantity of fuel that is injected into the cylinder.
Because diesel engines do not need to control air volumes, they usually lack a butterfly valve in the intake tract.
An exception to this generalization is newer diesel engines meeting stricter emissions standards, where such a valve is used to generate intake manifold vacuum, thereby allowing the introduction of exhaust gas (see EGR) to lower combustion temperatures and thereby minimize NOx production.
In a reciprocating engine aircraft, the throttle control is usually a hand-operated lever or knob.
It controls the engine power output, which may or may not reflect in a change of RPM, depending on the propeller installation (fixed-pitch or constant speed).
Some modern internal combustion engines do not use a traditional throttle, instead relying on their variable intake valve timing system to regulate the airflow into the cylinders, although the result is the same, albeit with less pumping losses.
In fuel injected engines, the throttle body is the part of the air intake system that controls the amount of air flowing into the engine, in response to driver accelerator pedal input in the main.
The throttle body is usually located between the air filter box and the intake manifold, and it is usually attached to, or near, the mass airflow sensor.
Often, an engine coolant line also runs through it in order for the engine to draw intake air at a certain temperature (the engine's current coolant temperature, which the ECU senses through the relevant sensor) and therefore with a known density.
The largest piece inside the throttle body is the throttle plate, which is a butterfly valve that regulates the airflow.
On many cars, the accelerator pedal motion is communicated via the throttle cable, which is mechanically connected to the throttle linkages, which, in turn, rotate the throttle plate.
In cars with electronic throttle control (also known as "drive-by-wire"), an electric actuator controls the throttle linkages and the accelerator pedal connects not to the throttle body, but to a sensor, which outputs a signal proportional to the current pedal position and sends it to the ECU.
The ECU then determines the throttle opening based on the accelerator pedal's position and inputs from other engine sensors such as the engine coolant temperature sensor.
When the driver presses on the accelerator pedal, the throttle plate rotates within the throttle body, opening the throttle passage to allow more air into the intake manifold, immediately drawn inside by its vacuum.
Usually a mass airflow sensor measures this change and communicates it to the ECU.
The ECU then increases the amount of fuel injected by the injectors in order to obtain the required air-fuel ratio.
Often a throttle position sensor (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the throttle plate to provide the ECU with information on whether the throttle is in the idle position, wide-open throttle (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.
Throttle bodies may also contain valves and adjustments to control the minimum airflow during idle.
Even in those units that are not "drive-by-wire", there will often be a small solenoid driven valve, the Idle Air Control Valve (IACV), that the ECU uses to control the amount of air that can bypass the main throttle opening to allow the engine to idle when the throttle is closed.
The most basic carbureted engines, such as single cylinder Briggs & Stratton lawn-mower engines, feature a single small throttle plate over a basic carburetor with a single venturi.
The throttle is either open or closed (although there is always a small hole or other bypass to allow a small amount of air to flow through so the engine can idle when the throttle is closed), or some intermediate position.
Since air velocity is crucial to the functioning of a carburetor, to keep average air velocity up, larger engines require more complex carburetors with multiple small venturis, typically two or four (these venturis are commonly called "barrels").
A typical "2-barrel" carburetor uses a single oval or rectangular throttle plate, and works similarly to a single venturi carburetor, but with two small openings instead of one.
A 4-venturi carburetor has two pairs of venturis, each pair regulated by a single oval or rectangular throttle plate.
Under normal operation, only one throttle plate (the "primary") opens when the accelerator pedal is pressed, allowing more air into the engine, but keeping overall airflow velocity through the carburetor high (thus improving efficiency).
The "secondary" throttle is operated either mechanically when the primary plate is opened past a certain amount, or via engine vacuum, influenced by the position of the accelerator pedal and engine load, allowing for greater air flow into the engine at high RPM and load and better efficiency at low RPM.
Multiple 2-venturi or 4-venturi carburetors can be used simultaneously in situations where maximum engine power is of priority.
A throttle body is somewhat analogous to the carburetor in a non-injected engine, although it is important to remember that a throttle body is not the same thing as a throttle, and that carbureted engines have throttles as well.
A throttle body simply supplies a convenient place to mount a throttle in the absence of a carburetor venturi.
Carburetors are an older technology, which mechanically modulate the amount of air flow (with an internal throttle plate) and combine air and fuel together (venturi).
Cars with fuel injection don't need a mechanical device to meter the fuel flow, since that duty is taken over by injectors in the intake pathways (for multipoint fuel injection systems) or cylinders (for direct injection systems) coupled with electronic sensors and computers which precisely calculate how long should a certain injector stay open and therefore how much fuel should be injected by each injection pulse.
However, they do still need a throttle to control the airflow into the engine, together with a sensor that detects its current opening angle, so that the correct air/fuel ratio can be met at any RPM and engine load combination.
The simplest way to do this is to simply remove the carburetor unit, and bolt a simple unit containing a throttle body and fuel injectors on instead.
This is known as single-port injection, also known by different marketing names (such as "throttle-body injection" by General Motors and "central fuel injection" by Ford, among others), and it allows an older engine design to be converted from carburetor to fuel injection without significantly altering the intake manifold design.
More complex later designs use intake manifolds, and even cylinder heads, specially designed for the inclusion of injectors.
Most fuel injected cars have a single throttle, contained in a throttle body.
Vehicles can sometimes employ more than one throttle body, connected by linkages to operate simultaneously, which improves throttle response and allows a straighter path for the airflow to the cylinder head, as well as for equal-distance intake runners of short length, difficult to achieve when all the runners have to travel to certain location to connect to a single throttle body, at the cost of greater complexity and packaging issues.
At the extreme, higher-performance cars like the E92 BMW M3 and Ferraris, and high-performance motorcycles like the Yamaha R6, can use a separate throttle body for each cylinder, often called "individual throttle bodies" or ITBs.
Although rare in production vehicles, these are common equipment on many racing cars and modified street vehicles.
This practice harks back to the days when many high performance cars were given one, small, single-venturi carburettor for each cylinder or pair of cylinders (i.e. Weber, SU carburettors), each one with their own small throttle plate inside.
In a carburettor, the smaller throttle opening also allowed for more precise and fast carburettor response, as well as better atomization of the fuel when running at low engine speeds.
Steam locomotives normally have the throttle (North American English) or regulator (British English) in a characteristic steam dome at the top of the boiler (although not all boilers feature these).
The additional height afforded by the dome helps to avoid any liquid (e.g. from bubbles on the surface of the boiler water) being drawn into the throttle valve, which could damage it, or lead to priming.
The throttle is basically a poppet valve, or series of poppet valves which open in sequence to regulate the amount of steam admitted to the steam chests over the pistons.
It is used in conjunction with the reversing lever to start, stop and to control the locomotive's power although, during steady-state running of most locomotives, it is preferable to leave the throttle wide open and to control the power by varying the steam cut-off point (which is done with the reversing lever), as this is more efficient.
A steam locomotive throttle valve poses a difficult design challenge as it must be opened and closed using hand effort against the considerable pressure (typically 250 psi or 1,700 kPa) of boiler steam.
One of the primary reasons for later multiple-sequential valves: it is far easier to open a small poppet valve against the pressure differential, and open the others once pressure begins to equalize than to open a single large valve, especially as steam pressures eventually exceeded 200 psi (1,400 kPa) or even 300 psi (2,100 kPa).
Examples include the balanced "double beat" type used on Gresley A3 Pacifics.
Throttling of a rocket engine means varying the thrust level in-flight.
This is not always a requirement; in fact, the thrust of a solid-fuel rocket is not controllable after ignition.
However, liquid-propellant rockets can be throttled by means of valves which regulate the flow of fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber.
Hybrid rocket engines, such as the one used in Space Ship One, use solid fuel with a liquid oxidizer, and therefore can be throttled.
Throttling tends to be required more for powered landings, and launch into space using a single main stage (such as the Space Shuttle), than for launch with multistage rockets.
They are also useful in situations where the airspeed of the vehicle must be limited due to aerodynamic stress in the denser atmosphere at lower levels (e.g. the Space Shuttle).
Rockets characteristically become lighter the longer they burn, with the changing ratio of thrust:weight resulting in increasing acceleration, so engines are often throttled (or switched off) to limit acceleration forces towards the end of a stage's burn time if it is carrying sensitive cargo (e.g. humans).
In a jet engine, thrust is controlled by changing the amount of fuel flowing into the combustion chamber, similar to a diesel engine.
The lifespan of the throttle is not set since it highly depends on the driving style and specific vehicle.
The throttle tends to be quite dirty after 100-150 thousand kilometers, and it is necessary to clean it up.
The malfunction of the throttle could be indicated by illuminated EPC warning light.
This is usually the case with modern Volkswagen Group vehicles.
Vehicles not equipped with the EPC warning light indicate issues with the throttle by illuminated check engine symbol.
Symptoms of the throttle malfunction could vary from poor idle, decreased engine power, poor mileage, bad acceleration, and so on.
The effective way to increase the throttle's lifespan is through regular maintenance and cleaning.
The Wall Street Journal is the second-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation, with a print circulation of around 560,000 and 3 million digital subscribers as of 2023.
WSJ publishes international editions in various regions around the world, including Europe and Asia.
The editorial pages of the Journal are typically center-right in their positions, while the newspaper itself maintains commitment to journalistic standards in its reporting.
The newspaper has won 39 Pulitzer Prizes.
The first products of Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the Journal, were brief news bulletins, nicknamed flimsies, hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the stock exchange in the early 1880s.
They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the Customers' Afternoon Letter.
Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into The Wall Street Journal, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones & Company News Service via telegraph.
In 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was launched.
It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1899, the Journal's Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow.
Journalist Clarence Barron purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902 (equivalent to $4,578,000 in 2023); circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s.
Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of business journalism.
In 1921, Barron's, the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.
Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States.
Barron's descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007.
The Journal took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York.
Bernard Kilgore was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the Journal.
Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its "What's News" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1 million when Kilgore died in 1967.
Under Kilgore, in 1947, the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize for William Henry Grimes's editorials.
In 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States ultimately placing its journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa.
In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers.
Later, the name was changed to Dow Jones Local Media Group.
The period from 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including "Factiva", The Wall Street Journal Asia, The Wall Street Journal Europe, the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, MarketWatch, and "WSJ Weekend Edition".
In 2007, News Corp. acquired Dow Jones.
WSJ., a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.
A complement to the print newspaper, The Wall Street Journal Online, was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning.
A weekly (later daily) crossword edited by Mike Shenk was introduced in 1998.
In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the Journal's print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements.
In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers.
Since then, digital subscription has risen to 1.3 million as of September 2018, falling to number two behind The New York Times with 3 million digital subscriptions.
In May 2008, an annual subscription to the digital edition of The Wall Street Journal cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition.
By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers.
Digital subscription rates increased dramatically to $443.88 per year as its popularity increased over print, with first-time subscribers paying $187.20 per year.
On November 30, 2004, Oasys Mobile and The Wall Street Journal released an app that would allow users to access content from The Wall Street Journal Online via their mobile phones.
In September 2005, the Journal launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years.
The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.
In 2005, the Journal reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1 million, and an average age of 55.
In 2007, the Journal launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions.
The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival Financial Times.
The nameplate is unique in having a period at the end.
Front-page advertising in the Journal was re-introduced on September 5, 2006.
This followed similar introductions in the European and Asian editions in late 2005.
After presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century –  always six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, "What's News" digest in the second and third, the "A-hed" feature story in the fourth (with 'hed' being jargon for headline) and themed weekly reports in the fifth column –  the paper in 2007 decreased its broadsheet width from 15 to 12 inches while keeping the length at 223⁄4 inches, to save newsprint costs.
News design consultant Mario Garcia collaborated on the changes.
Dow Jones said it would save US$18 million a year in newsprint costs across all The Wall Street Journal papers.
This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the "A-hed" out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories).
The paper uses ink dot drawings called hedcuts, introduced in 1979 and originally created by Kevin Sprouls, in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper.
the Journal still heavily employs the use of caricatures, including those by illustrator Ken Fallin, such as when Peggy Noonan memorialized then-recently deceased newsman Tim Russert.
The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more "lifestyle" sections.
The daily was awarded by the Society for News Design World's Best Designed Newspaper award for 1994 and 1997.
On May 2, 2007, News Corporation made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share.
The Bancroft family, which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.
Three months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement.
The US$5 billion sale added The Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch's news empire, which already included Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, London's The Times, the New York Post, and the Fox flagship station WNYW (Channel 5) and MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR (Channel 9).
On December 13, 2007, shareholders representing more than 60 percent of Dow Jones's voting stock approved the company's acquisition by News Corporation.
In an editorial page column, publisher L. Gordon Crovitz said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the Journal's news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent.
A special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity.
When the managing editor Marcus Brauchli resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier.
However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor.
A 2007 Journal article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past.
One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long "expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations".
Former Times assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when "Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing Times editor Harold Evans.
Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval.
'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?'
Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery."
Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.
In 2011, The Guardian found evidence that the Journal had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales.
These inflated sales numbers then enabled the Journal to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did.
In addition, the Journal agreed to run "articles" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising.
The case came to light after a Belgian Wall Street Journal employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton about the questionable practice.
As a result, the then Wall Street Journal Europe CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper's business partners involved in the issue.
Since September 2011, all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a Wall Street Journal disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.
The Journal, along with its parent Dow Jones & Company, was among the businesses News Corporation spun off in 2013 as the new News Corp.
In November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the Journal's editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced layoffs of staff and consolidation of its print sections.
The new "Business & Finance" section combined the former "Business & Tech" and "Money & Investing" sections.
The new "Life & Arts" section took the place of "Personal Journal" and "Arena".
In addition, the Journal's "Greater New York" coverage was reduced and moved to the main section of paper.
The section was shuttered on July 9, 2021.
The Personal Journal section branding was brought back in July 2020.
From 2019 through 2022, the Journal partnered with Facebook to provide content for the social-media site's "News Tab".
Facebook paid the Journal in excess of $10 million during that period, terminating the relationship as part of a broader shift away from news content.
On June 13, 2022, the Journal launched a product review website called Buy Side.
The website remains free and has a distinct team from the Journal newsroom.
In February 2024, the Journal laid off about 20 employees, primarily economics reporters based in Washington, D.C.
Moving forward, those beats will be covered by the newspaper's New York-based business team.
The next month the paper laid off another five people from its standards and ethics team.
In April, the paper laid off at least 11 people from its video and social media desks.
In May, the Journal cut six editorial staff positions from its Hong Kong bureau and another two reporter jobs in Singapore.
Moving forward the paper will shift its focus in the region from Hong Kong to Singapore with new the creation of several new jobs at that bureau.
More staff were laid off a few weeks later amid further restructuring, including at least eight reporters.
WSJ Noted., a monthly digital magazine, launches on June 30, 2020, in a bid to attract younger readers.
WSJ Live became available on mobile devices in September 2011.
WSJ Weekend, the weekend newspaper, expanded September 2010, with two new sections: "Off Duty" and "Review".
"Greater New York", a stand-alone, full-color section dedicated to the New York metro area, ran from April 2010 until July 2021.
The Wall Street Journal's San Francisco Bay Area Edition, which focuses on local news and events, launched on November 5, 2009, appearing locally each Thursday in the print Journal and every day online at WSJ.com/SF.
WSJ Weekend, formerly called Saturday's Weekend Edition: September 2005.

WSJ.com launched in April 1996.
First three-section Journal: October 1988.
First two-section Journal: June 1980.
Since 1980, the Journal has been published in multiple sections.
At one time, the Journal's page count averaged as many as 96 pages an issue, but with the industry-wide decline in advertising, the Journal in 2009–10 more typically published about 50 to 60 pages per issue.
85 news bureaus across 51 countries.
As of 2012, it had 26 printing plants.
Its Asia headquarters is in Hong Kong, but will move to Singapore after it stated it would do so in 2024.

is The Wall Street Journal's luxury lifestyle magazine.
Its coverage spans art, fashion, entertainment, design, food, architecture, travel and more.
Sarah Ball is Editor in Chief and Omblyne Pelier is Publisher.
Launched as a quarterly in 2008, the magazine grew to 12 issues a year for 2014.
The magazine is inserted into the weekend U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal and is available on WSJ.com and in the newspaper's iPad app.
Penélope Cruz, Carmelo Anthony, Woody Allen, Scarlett Johansson, Emilia Clarke, Daft Punk, and Gisele Bündchen have all been featured on the cover.
In 2012, the magazine launched its Innovator Awards program.
An extension of the November Innovators issue, the awards ceremony, held in New York City at Museum of Modern Art, honors visionaries across the fields of design, fashion, architecture, humanitarianism, art and technology.
In 2013, Adweek named WSJ.
the "Hottest Lifestyle Magazine of the Year" in its annual Hot List.
OpinionJournal.com was a website featuring content from the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal.
It existed separately from the news content at wsj.com until January 2008, when it was merged into the main website.
The editorials (titled "Review & Outlook") reflected The Journal's conservative political editorial line, as did its regular columnists, who included Peggy Noonan, John Fund, and Daniel Henninger.
WSJ Noted.
On June 30, 2020, the Journal launched WSJ Noted., a monthly digital "news and culture" magazine for subscribers aged 18–34 in a bid to attract a younger audience to the Journal.
The magazine has a group of some 7,000 young adults who are invited to preview content, provide feedback, and join Q&As with Noted staff.
The Wall Street Journal editorial board members oversee the Journal's editorial page, dictating the tone and direction of the newspaper's opinion section.
The Wall Street Journal does not provide details on the exact duties of board members.
Every Saturday and Sunday, three editorial page writers and host Paul Gigot, editor of the editorial page, appear on Fox News Channel's Journal Editorial Report, where they discuss current issues with a variety of guests.
As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958–1971) and Robert Bartley (served 1972–2000) provided a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis.
Contrasts have been noted between the Journal's news reporting and its editorial pages.
"While Journal reporters keep busy informing readers," wrote one reporter in 1982, "Journal editorial writers put forth views that often contradict the paper's best reporting and news analysis."
Two summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, and in 1996 by the Columbia Journalism Review criticized the Journal's editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s.
One reference work in 2011 described the editorial pages as "rigidly neoconservative" while noting that the news coverage "has enjoyed a sterling reputation among readers of all political stripes".
In July 2020, more than 280 Journal journalists and Dow Jones staff members wrote a letter to new publisher Almar Latour to criticize the opinion pages' "lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence", adding that "opinion articles often make assertions that are contradicted by WSJ reporting."
The editorial board responded that its opinion pages "won't wilt under cancel-culture pressure" and that the objective of the editorial content is to be independent of the Journal's news content and offer alternative views to "the uniform progressive views that dominate nearly all of today's media."
The board's response did not address issues regarding fact-checking that had been raised in the letter.
During the Reagan administration, the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics.
Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.
In the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the Journal has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates.
The Journal's editorial pages and columns, run separately from the news pages, have a conservative bent and are highly influential in establishment conservative circles.
Despite this, the Journal refrains from endorsing candidates and has not endorsed a candidate since 1928.
The editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy.
The Journal's editorial page was seen as critical of many aspects of Barack Obama's presidency.
In particular, it has been a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act legislation passed in 2010, and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill.
The Journal's editorial page has also criticized the Obama administration's energy policies and foreign policy.
On October 25, 2017, the editorial board called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and accused Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with Russia.
In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller's resignation.
The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within The Wall Street Journal, as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper's credibility.
In October 2021, the Journal published a letter from former President Donald Trump in the Letters to the Editor section of the editorial pages.
Other news sources described the contents of the letter as false and debunked claims about the 2020 presidential election.
The next day, the editorial board published their own critique of Trump's letter.
The Journal editorial pages were described as a "forum for climate change denial" in 2011 due to columns that attacked climate scientists and accused them of engaging in fraud.
A 2011 study found that the Journal was alone among major American print news media in how, mainly in its editorial pages, it adopted a false balance that overplayed the uncertainty in climate science or denied anthropogenic climate change altogether.
That year, the Associated Press described the Journal's editorial pages as "a place friendly to climate change skeptics".
In 2013, the editorial board and other opinion writers vocally criticized President Obama's plan to address climate change, mostly without mentioning climate science.
A 2015 study found The Wall Street Journal was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers.
It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies, tending to take the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit.
Climate Feedback, a fact-checking website on media coverage of climate science, determined that multiple opinion articles range between "low" and "very low" in terms of scientific credibility.
The Partnership for Responsible Growth stated in 2016 that 14% of the guest editorials on climate change presented the results of "mainstream climate science", while the majority did not.
The Partnership also determined that none of the 201 editorials concerning climate change that were published in The Wall Street Journal since 1997 conceded that the burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the Journal published numerous columns opposing and misrepresenting the scientific consensus on the harms of second-hand smoke, acid rain, and ozone depletion, in addition to public policy efforts to curb pesticides and asbestos.
The Journal later recognized that efforts to curb acid rain through cap-and-trade had been successful, a decade after the Clean Air Act Amendments.
Its reporting has been described as "small-c conservatism".
Some of the Journal's former reporters say that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch's purchase.
The Journal's editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters.
According to CNN in 2007, the Journal's "newsroom staff has a reputation for non-partisan reporting."
Ben Smith of the New York Times described the Journal's news reporting as "small-c
[conservative]", and noted that its readership leans further to the right than other major newspapers.
about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch.
An August 1, 2007, editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to "maintain the values and integrity of the Journal".
In 2016 and 2017, the Journal leadership under Baker came under fire from critics, both from the outside and from within the newsroom, who viewed the paper's coverage of President Donald Trump as too timid.
Particularly controversial was the Journal's November 2016 front-page headline that repeated Trump's false claim that "millions of people" had voted illegally in the election, only noting that the statement was "without corroboration".
At a town-hall-style meeting with Journal staff in February 2017, Baker defended the paper's coverage, saying that it was objective and protected the paper from being "dragged into the political process" through a dispute with the Trump administration.
A 2018 survey conducted by Gallup and the Knight Foundation found that The Wall Street Journal was considered the third most-accurate and fourth most-unbiased news organization among the general public, tenth among Democrats, and second among Republicans.
On February 19, 2020, China announced the revoking of the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing.
China accused the paper of failing to apologize for publishing articles that criticized China's efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and failing to investigate and punish those responsible.
In June 2020, following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests, journalists at the Journal sent a letter to editor in chief Matt Murray demanding changes to the way the paper covers race, policing and finance.
The reporters stated that they "frequently meet resistance when trying to reflect the accounts and voices of workers, residents or customers, with some editors voicing heightened skepticism of those sources' credibility compared with executives, government officials or other entities".
The Journal has won 38 Pulitzer Prizes in its history.
Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting.
In 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco.
Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen Journal articles.
Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, which was turned into a film for HBO.
In the 1980s, then-Journal reporter James B. Stewart brought national attention to the illegal practice of insider trading.
He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism in 1988, which he shared with Daniel Hertzberg, who went on to serve as the paper's senior deputy managing editor before resigning in 2009.
Stewart expanded on this theme in his 1991 book, Den of Thieves.
David Sanford, a Page One features editor who was infected with HIV in 1982 in a bathhouse, wrote a front-page personal account of how, with the assistance of improved treatments for HIV, he went from planning his death to planning his retirement.
He and six other reporters wrote about the new treatments, political and economic issues, and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting about AIDS.
Jonathan Weil, a reporter at the Dallas bureau of The Wall Street Journal, is credited with first breaking the story of financial abuses at Enron in September 2000.
Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller reported on the story regularly, and wrote a book, 24 Days.
In October 2021, the Journal released Bad Bets, a podcast that recounted the papers reporting on Enron.
The Journal claims to have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.
Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street.
Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper's 112-year history.
They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form.
Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned.
He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal's offices and filling them with dust and debris.
The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.
The Journal subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world.
In Kabul, Afghanistan, a reporter from The Wall Street Journal bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities.
The encrypted files were decrypted and translated.
It was during this coverage that terrorists kidnapped and killed Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.
In 2007, the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, with its iconic gold medal, for exposing companies that illegally backdate stock options they awarded executives to increase their value.
Kate Kelly wrote a three-part series that detailed events that led to the collapse of Bear Stearns.
A report published on September 30, 2010, detailing allegations McDonald's had plans to drop health coverage for hourly employees drew criticism from McDonald's as well as the Obama administration.
The Wall Street Journal reported the plan to drop coverage stemmed from new health care requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
McDonald's called the report "speculative and misleading", stating they had no plans to drop coverage.
The Wall Street Journal report and subsequent rebuttal received coverage from several other media outlets.
In 2015, a report published by The Journal alleged that up to US$700 million was wired from 1MDB, a Malaysian state investment company, to the personal accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak at AmBank, the fifth largest lender in Malaysia.
Razak responded by threatening to sue the New York-based newspaper.
The Journal's reporting on the 1MDB scandal was a finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in international reporting.
The report prompted some governmental agencies in Malaysia to conduct an investigation into the allegation.
On July 28, 2020, Najib Razak was found guilty on seven charges in the 1MDB scandal.
He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
In 2015, a report written by the Journal's John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos' technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors.
According to Vanity Fair, "a damning report published in The Wall Street Journal had alleged that the company was, in effect, a sham—that its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors' equipment."
The Journal has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos' and Holmes' credibility.
In May 2018, Carreyrou released a book about Theranos, Bad Blood, which met with critical success (and was compared to Stewart's Den of Thieves).
The following month, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and conspiracy charges in relation to her role as CEO of Theranos.
Holmes was found guilty on four of the eleven original charges in January 2022.
Rupert Murdoch—at the time a major investor in Theranos and owner of the Journal—lost approximately $100 million in his investments in Theranos.
On January 12, 2018, Michael Rothfeld and Joe Palazzolo reported in The Wall Street Journal that during the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen coordinated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels for her silence regarding an alleged affair.
In subsequent reports, the method of payment and many other details were extensively covered.
In April of that year, FBI agents stormed Cohen's home, seizing records related to the transaction.
On August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts including campaign finance violations in connection with the Daniels payment.
The coverage earned the Journal the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.
In automotive engineering, toe, also known as tracking, is the symmetric angle that each wheel makes with the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, as a function of static geometry, and kinematic and compliant effects.
This can be contrasted with steer, which is the antisymmetric angle, i.e. both wheels point to the left or right, in parallel (roughly).
Negative toe, or toe out, is the front of the wheel pointing away from the centreline of the vehicle.
Positive toe, or toe in, is the front of the wheel pointing towards the centreline of the vehicle.
Historically, and still commonly in the United States, toe was specified as the linear difference (either inches or millimeters) of the distance between the two front-facing and rear-facing tire centerlines at the outer diameter and axle-height; since the toe angle in that case depends on the tire diameter, the linear dimension toe specification for a particular vehicle is for specified tires.
In a rear-wheel drive vehicle, increased front toe-in provides greater straight-line stability at the cost of some sluggishness of turning response.
Performance vehicles may run zero front toe or even some toe-out for a better response to steering inputs.
Increased front toe-in marginally increases the wear on the tires as the tires are under slight side slip conditions when the steering is set straight ahead.
On front-wheel drive vehicles, the situation is more complex.
Rear toe-in provides better stability during cornering.
Toe is usually adjustable in production automobiles, even though caster angle and camber angle are often not adjustable.
Maintenance of front-end alignment, which used to involve all three adjustments, currently involves only setting the toe; in most cases, even for a car in which caster or camber are adjustable, only the toe will need adjustment.
Toe may only be adjustable on the front wheels.
One related concept is that the proper toe for straight-line travel of a vehicle will not be correct while turning, since the inside wheel must travel around a smaller radius than the outside wheel; to compensate for this, the steering linkage typically conforms more or less to Ackermann steering geometry, modified to suit the characteristics of the individual vehicle.
The front rail wheels of road–rail vehicles are often set to toe-in by a distance of 6 mm over 1 metre.
Unlike other forms of rolling stock, road-rail vehicles do not always have a common axle between the rail wheels and the toe-in angle prevents the vehicle from hunting when on-rail.
When a wheel is set up to have some camber angle, the interaction between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface (camber thrust).
This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance as well as increasing tire wear.
A small degree of toe (toe-out for negative camber, toe-in for positive camber) will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance.
On some competition vehicles such as go-karts, especially where power is extremely limited and is highly regulated by the rules of the sport, these effects can become very significant in terms of competitiveness and performance.
Toe-in and toe-out give the steering stability.
A thermostat is a regulating device component which senses the temperature of a physical system and performs actions so that the system's temperature is maintained near a desired  setpoint.
Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a setpoint temperature.
Examples include building heating, central heating, air conditioners, HVAC systems, water heaters, as well as kitchen equipment including ovens and refrigerators and medical and scientific incubators.
In scientific literature, these devices are often broadly classified as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs).
Thermostatically controlled loads comprise roughly 50% of the overall electricity demand in the United States.
A thermostat operates as a "closed loop" control device, as it seeks to reduce the error between the desired and measured temperatures.
Sometimes a thermostat combines both the sensing and control action elements of a controlled system, such as in an automotive thermostat.
The word thermostat is derived from the Greek words θερμός thermos, "hot" and στατός statos, "standing, stationary".
A thermostat exerts control by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or by regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed, to maintain the correct temperature.
A thermostat can often be the main control unit for a heating or cooling system, in applications ranging from ambient air control to automotive coolant control.
Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a setpoint temperature.
Examples include building heating, central heating, and air conditioners, kitchen equipment such as ovens and refrigerators, and medical and scientific incubators.
Thermostats use different types of sensors to measure temperatures and actuate control operations.
Mechanical thermostats commonly use bimetallic strips, converting a temperature change into mechanical displacement, to actuate control of the heating or cooling sources.
Electronic thermostats, instead, use a thermistor or other semiconductor sensor, processing temperature change as electronic signals, to control the heating or cooling equipment.
Conventional thermostats are example of "bang-bang controllers" as the controlled system either operates at full capacity once the setpoint is reached, or keeps completely off.
Although it is the simplest program to implement, such control method requires to include some hysteresis in order to prevent excessively rapid cycling of the equipment around the setpoint.
As a consequence, conventional thermostats cannot control temperatures very precisely.
Instead, there are oscillations of a certain magnitude, usually 1-2 °C.
Such control is in general inaccurate, inefficient and high-level mechanical wear, but for components like compressors, it still has a significant cost advantage compared with more advanced ones allowing continuously variable capacity.
Another consideration is the time delay of the controlled system.
To improve the control performance of the system, thermostats can include an "anticipator", which stops heating/cooling slightly earlier than reaching the setpoint, as the system will continue to produce heat for a short while.
Turning off exactly at the setpoint will cause actual temperature to exceed the desired range, known as "overshoot".
Bimetallic sensors can include a physical "anticipator", which has a thin wire touched on the thermostat.
When current passes the wire, a small amount of heat is generated and transferred to the bimetallic coil.
Electronic thermostats have an electronic equivalent.
When higher control precision is required, a PID or MPC controller is preferred.
However, they are nowadays mainly adopted for industrial purposes, for example, for semiconductor manufacturing factories or museums.
Early technologies included mercury thermometers with electrodes inserted directly through the glass, so that when a certain (fixed) temperature was reached the contacts would be closed by the mercury.
These were accurate to within a degree of temperature.
Bimetallic mechanical or electrical sensors.
Possibly the earliest recorded examples of thermostatic control were built by a Dutch innovator, Cornelis Drebbel (1572–1633), about 1620 in England.
He invented a mercury thermostat to regulate the temperature of a chicken incubator.
This is one of the first recorded feedback-controlled devices.
Modern thermostatic control was developed in the 1830s by Andrew Ure (1778–1857), a Scottish chemist.
The textile mills of the time needed a constant and steady temperature to operate optimally, so Ure designed the bimetallic thermostat, which would bend as one of the metals expanded in response to the increased temperature and cut off the energy supply.
Warren S. Johnson (1847–1911), of Wisconsin, patented a bi-metal room thermostat in 1883, and two years later sought a patent for the first multi-zone thermostatic control system.
Albert Butz (1849–1905) invented the electric thermostat and patented it in 1886.
One of the first industrial uses of the thermostat was in the regulation of the temperature in poultry incubators.
Charles Hearson, a British engineer, designed the first modern incubator for eggs, which was taken up for use on poultry farms in 1879.
This covers only devices which both sense and control using purely mechanical means.
Domestic water and steam based central heating systems have traditionally been controlled by bi-metallic strip thermostats, and this is dealt with later in this article.
Purely mechanical control has been localised steam or hot-water radiator bi-metallic thermostats which regulated the individual flow.
However, thermostatic radiator valves (TRV) are now being widely used.
Purely mechanical thermostats are used to regulate dampers in some rooftop turbine vents, reducing building heat loss in cool or cold periods.
Some automobile passenger heating systems have a thermostatically controlled valve to regulate the water flow and temperature to an adjustable level.
In older vehicles the thermostat controls the application of engine vacuum to actuators that control water valves and flappers to direct the flow of air.
In modern vehicles, the vacuum actuators may be operated by small solenoids under the control of a central computer.
Perhaps the most common example of purely mechanical thermostat technology in use today is the internal combustion engine cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air-cooled radiator.
This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature.
The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded.
The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax.
Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range.
On many automobile engines, including all Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict flow to the heater core.
The passenger side tank of the radiator is used as a bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core.
This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens.
Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.
A thermostatic mixing valve uses a wax pellet to control the mixing of hot and cold water.
A common application is to permit operation of an electric water heater at a temperature hot enough to kill Legionella bacteria (above 60 °C, 140 °F), while the output of the valve produces water that is cool enough to not immediately scald (49 °C, 120 °F).
A wax pellet driven valve can be analyzed through graphing the wax pellet's hysteresis which consists of two thermal expansion curves; extension (motion) vs. temperature increase, and contraction (motion) vs. temperature decrease.
The spread between the up and down curves visually illustrate the valve's hysteresis; there is always hysteresis within wax driven valves due to the phase transition or phase change between solids and liquids.
Hysteresis can be controlled with specialized blended mixes of hydrocarbons; tight hysteresis is what most desire, however some applications require broader ranges.
Wax pellet driven valves are used in anti scald, freeze protection, over-temp purge, solar thermal energy or solar thermal, automotive, and aerospace applications among many others.
Thermostats are sometimes used to regulate gas ovens.
It consists of a gas-filled bulb connected to the control unit by a slender copper tube.
The bulb is normally located at the top of the oven.
The tube ends in a chamber sealed by a diaphragm.
As the thermostat heats up, the gas expands applying pressure to the diaphragm which reduces the flow of gas to the burner.
A pneumatic thermostat is a thermostat that controls a heating or cooling system via a series of air-filled control tubes.
This "control air" system responds to the pressure changes (due to temperature) in the control tube to activate heating or cooling when required.
The control air typically is maintained on "mains" at 15-18 psi (although usually operable up to 20 psi).
Pneumatic thermostats typically provide output/ branch/ post-restrictor (for single-pipe operation) pressures of 3-15 psi which is piped to the end device (valve/ damper actuator/ pneumatic-electric switch, etc.).
The pneumatic thermostat was invented by Warren Johnson in 1895 soon after he invented the electric thermostat.
In 2009, Harry Sim was awarded a patent for a pneumatic-to-digital interface that allows pneumatically controlled buildings to be integrated with building automation systems to provide similar benefits as direct digital control (DDC).
Water and steam based central heating systems have traditionally had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats.
These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch.
Typically the central system would be switched on when the temperature drops below the setpoint on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching.
Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors.
A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the setpoint desired by the user.
These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.
This follows the same nomenclature as described in Relay § Terminology and Switch § Contact terminology.
A thermostat is considered to be activated by thermal energy, thus “normal” refers to the state in which temperature is below the setpoint.
"NO" stands for "normally open".
This is the same as "COR" ("close on rise").
May be used to start a fan when it is becoming hot, and to stop the fan when it has become cold enough.
"NC" stands for "normally closed".
This is the same as "OOR" ("open on rise").
May be used to start a heater when it is becoming cold, and to stop the heater when it has become warm enough.
"CO" stands for "change over".
This serves both as "NO" and "NC".
May be used to start a fan when it is becoming hot, but also (on the opposite terminal), to start a heater when it is becoming cold.
Any leading number stands for number of contact sets, like "1NO", "1NC" for one contact set with two terminals.
"1CO" will also have one contact set, even if it is a switch-over with three terminals.
The illustration is the interior of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a gas-fired heater via an electric gas valve.
Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler zone valves, electric attic fans, electric furnaces, electric baseboard heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers.
The power through the thermostat is provided by the heating device and may range from millivolts to 240 volts in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems).
Due to the variety of possible voltages and currents available at the thermostat, caution must be taken when selecting a replacement device.
Setpoint control lever.
This is moved to the right for a higher temperature.
The round indicator pin in the center of the second slot shows through a numbered slot in the outer case.
Bimetallic strip wound into a coil.
The center of the coil is attached to a rotating post attached to lever (1).
As the coil gets colder the moving end — carrying (4) — moves clockwise.
Flexible wire.
The left side is connected via one wire of a pair to the heater control valve.
Moving contact attached to the bimetal coil.
Thence, to the heater's controller.
Fixed contact screw.
This is adjusted by the manufacturer.
It is connected electrically by a second wire of the pair to the thermocouple and the heater's electrically operated gas valve.
This ensures a good contact when the contact closes.
It also provides hysteresis to prevent short heating cycles, as the temperature must be raised several degrees before the contacts will open.
As an alternative, some thermostats instead use a mercury switch on the end of the bimetal coil.
The weight of the mercury on the end of the coil tends to keep it there, also preventing short heating cycles.
However, this type of thermostat is banned in many countries due to its highly and permanently toxic nature if broken.
When replacing these thermostats they must be regarded as chemical waste.
Not shown in the illustration is a separate bimetal thermometer on the outer case to show the actual temperature at the thermostat.
As illustrated in the use of the thermostat above, all of the power for the control system is provided by a thermopile which is a combination of many stacked thermocouples, heated by the pilot light.
The thermopile produces sufficient electrical power to drive a low-power gas valve, which under control of one or more thermostat switches, in turn controls the input of fuel to the burner.
This type of device is generally considered obsolete as pilot lights can waste a surprising amount of gas (in the same way a dripping faucet can waste a large amount of water over an extended period), and are also no longer used on stoves, but are still to be found in many gas water heaters and gas fireplaces.
Their poor efficiency is acceptable in water heaters, since most of the energy "wasted" on the pilot still represents a direct heat gain for the water tank.
The Millivolt system also makes it unnecessary for a special electrical circuit to be run to the water heater or furnace; these systems are often completely self-sufficient and can run without any external electrical power supply.
For tankless "on demand" water heaters, pilot ignition is preferable because it is faster than hot-surface ignition and more reliable than spark ignition.
Some programmable thermostats - those that offer simple "millivolt" or "two-wire" modes - will control these systems.
The majority of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits.
The source of the 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed as part of the heating/cooling equipment.
The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels.
Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation.
A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating.
This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting.
A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating.
A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating.
This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively.
Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.
Electromechanical thermostats use resistance elements as anticipators.
Most electronic thermostats use either thermistor devices or integrated logic elements for the anticipation function.
In some electronic thermostats, the thermistor anticipator may be located outdoors, providing a variable anticipation depending on the outdoor temperature.
Thermostat enhancements include outdoor temperature display, programmability, and system fault indication.
While such 24 volt thermostats are incapable of operating a furnace when the mains power fails, most such furnaces require mains power for heated air fans (and often also hot-surface or electronic spark ignition) rendering moot the functionality of the thermostat.
In other circumstances such as piloted wall and "gravity" (fanless) floor and central heaters the low voltage system described previously may be capable of remaining functional when electrical power is unavailable.
There are no standards for wiring color codes, but convention has settled on the following terminal codes and colors.
In all cases, the manufacturer's instructions should be considered definitive.
Line voltage thermostats are most commonly used for electric space heaters such as a baseboard heater or a direct-wired electric furnace.
If a line voltage thermostat is used, system power (in the United States, 120 or 240 volts) is directly switched by the thermostat.
With switching current often exceeding 40 amperes, using a low voltage thermostat on a line voltage circuit will result at least in the failure of the thermostat and possibly a fire.
Line voltage thermostats are sometimes used in other applications, such as the control of fan-coil (fan powered from line voltage blowing through a coil of tubing which is either heated or cooled by a larger system)  units in large systems using centralized boilers and chillers, or to control circulation pumps in hydronic heating applications.
Some programmable thermostats are available to control line-voltage systems.
Baseboard heaters will especially benefit from a programmable thermostat which is capable of continuous control (as are at least some Honeywell models), effectively controlling the heater like a lamp dimmer, and gradually increasing and decreasing heating to ensure an extremely constant room temperature (continuous control rather than relying on the averaging effects of hysteresis).
Systems which include a fan (electric furnaces, wall heaters, etc.) must typically use simple on/off controls.
Newer digital thermostats have no moving parts to measure temperature and instead rely on thermistors or other semiconductor devices such as a resistance thermometer (resistance temperature detector).
Typically one or more regular batteries must be installed to operate it, although some so-called "power stealing" digital thermostats (operated for energy harvesting) use the common 24-volt AC circuits as a power source, but will not operate on thermopile powered "millivolt" circuits used in some furnaces.
Each has an LCD screen showing the current temperature, and the current setting.
Most also have a clock, and time-of-day and even day-of-week settings for the temperature, used for comfort and energy conservation.
Some advanced models have touch screens, or the ability to work with home automation or building automation systems.
Digital thermostats use either a relay or a semiconductor device such as triac to act as a switch to control the HVAC unit.
Units with relays will operate millivolt systems, but often make an audible "click" noise when switching on or off.
Most digital thermostats in common residential use in North America and Europe are programmable thermostats, which will typically provide a 30% energy savings if left with their default programs; adjustments to these defaults may increase or reduce energy savings.
The programmable thermostat article provides basic information on the operation, selection and installation of such a thermostat.
With non-zoned (typical residential, one thermostat for the whole house) systems, when the thermostat's R (or Rh) and W terminals are connected, the furnace will go through its start-up procedure and produce heat.
With zoned systems (some residential, many commercial systems — several thermostats controlling different "zones" in the building), the thermostat will cause small electric motors to open valves or dampers and start the furnace or boiler if it is not already running.
Most programmable thermostats will control these systems.
Depending on what is being controlled, a forced-air air conditioning thermostat generally has an external switch for heat/off/cool, and another on/auto to turn the blower fan on constantly or only when heating and cooling are running.
Four wires come to the centrally-located thermostat from the main heating/cooling unit (usually located in a closet, basement, or occasionally in the attic): One wire, usually red, supplies 24 volts AC power to the thermostat, while the other three supply control signals from the thermostat, usually white for heat, yellow for cooling, and green to turn on the blower fan.
The power is supplied by a transformer, and when the thermostat makes contact between the 24 volt power and one or two of the other wires, a relay back at the heating/cooling unit activates the corresponding heat/fan/cool function of the unit(s).
A thermostat, when set to "cool", will only turn on when the ambient temperature of the surrounding room is above the set temperature.
Thus, if the controlled space has a temperature normally above the desired setting when the heating/cooling system is off, it would be wise to keep the thermostat set to "cool", despite what the temperature is outside.
On the other hand, if the temperature of the controlled area falls below the desired degree, then it is advisable to turn the thermostat to "heat".
The heat pump is a refrigeration based appliance which reverses refrigerant flow between the indoor and outdoor coils.
This is done by energizing a reversing valve (also known as a "4-way" or "change-over" valve).
During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air.
During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat is removed from the outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil.
The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the change-over from heat to cool.
Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an "O" terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling.
Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a "B" terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating.
The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall.
At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building.
A typical heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point.
Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat.
During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place.
This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity.
Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional defrost of the outdoor coil.
This is done by reversing the cycle to the cooling mode, shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the electric heating elements.
The electric heat in defrost mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building.
The elements are then used in the "reheat" function.
Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in defrost and electric heat is activated, the defrost function is not controlled by the thermostat.
Since the heat pump has electric heat elements for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the electric heat elements should the refrigeration system fail.
This function is normally activated by an "E" terminal on the thermostat.
When in emergency heat, the thermostat makes no attempt to operate the compressor or outdoor fan.
The thermostat should not be located on an outside wall or where it could be exposed to direct sunlight at any time during the day.
It should be located away from the room's cooling or heating vents or device, yet exposed to general airflow from the room(s) to be regulated.
An open hallway may be most appropriate for a single zone system, where living rooms and bedrooms are operated as a single zone.
If the hallway may be closed by doors from the regulated spaces then these should be left open when the system is in use.
If the thermostat is too close to the source controlled then the system will tend to "short a cycle", and numerous starts and stops can be annoying and in some cases shorten equipment life.
A multiple zoned system can save considerable energy by regulating individual spaces, allowing unused rooms to vary in temperature by turning off the heating and cooling.
HVAC systems take a long time, usually one to several hours, to cool down or warm up the space from near outdoor conditions in summer or winter.
Thus, it is a common practice to set setback temperatures when the space is not occupied (night and/or holidays).
On the one hand, compared with maintaining at the original setpoint, substantial energy consumption can be saved.
On the other hand, compared with turning off the system completely, it avoids room temperature drifting too much from the comfort zone, thus reducing the time of possible discomfort when the space is again occupied.
New thermostats are mostly programmable and include an internal clock that allows this setback feature to be easily incorporated.
It has been reported that many thermostats in office buildings are non-functional dummy devices, installed to give tenants' employees an illusion of control.
These dummy thermostats are in effect a type of placebo button.
However, these thermostats are often used to detect the temperature in the zone, even though their controls are disabled.
This function is often referred to as "lockout".
Founded in 1554 by Jesuit priests, the city was the center of the bandeirantes settlers during Colonial Brazil, but it became a relevant economic force only during the Brazilian coffee cycle in the mid-19th century and later consolidated its role as the main national economic hub with industrialization in Brazil in the 20th century, which made the city a cosmopolitan melting pot, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas in the world, with ethnic neighborhoods like Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade, and people from more than 200 other countries.
The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, is home to 20 million inhabitants and ranks as the most populous in Brazil and one of the most populous in the world.
The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo also created the São Paulo Macrometropolis, the first megalopolis in the Southern Hemisphere, with more than 30 million inhabitants.
The city is one of the main cultural hubs in Latin America and it is home to monuments, parks and museums such as the Latin American Memorial, Ibirapuera Park, São Paulo Museum of Art, Pinacoteca, Cinemateca, Itaú Cultural, Museum of Ipiranga, Football Museum, Museum of the Portuguese Language, and the Museum of Image and Sound.
São Paulo also holds relevant cultural events like the Sao Paulo Jazz Festival, São Paulo Art Biennial, São Paulo Fashion Week, Lollapalooza, Primavera Sound, Comic Con Experience and the São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, the second largest LGBT event in the world.
São Paulo was also host of many sporting events such as the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 1963 Pan American Games and the São Paulo Indy 300 in addition to hosting the annual São Paulo Grand Prix of Formula One and the Saint Silvester Road Race.
The region of modern-day São Paulo, then known as Piratininga plains around the Tietê River, was inhabited by the Tupi people, such as the Tupiniquim, Guaianás, and Guarani.
Other tribes also lived in areas that today form the metropolitan region.
The region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the Europeans.
The most notable cacique was Tibiriçá, known for his support for the Portuguese and other European colonists.
Among the many indigenous names of places, rivers, neighborhoods, etc., that survive today are Tietê, Ipiranga, Tamanduateí, Anhangabaú, Piratininga, Itaquaquecetuba, Cotia, Itapevi, Barueri, Embu-Guaçu, etc.
The Portuguese village of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga was marked by the founding of the Colégio de São Paulo de Piratininga on 25 January 1554.
The Jesuit college of twelve priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and Spanish priest José de Anchieta.
They built a mission on top of a steep hill between the Anhangabaú and Tamanduateí rivers.
They first had a small structure built of rammed earth, made by Native Indian workers in their traditional style.
The priests wanted to evangelize these Indians who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity.
The site was separated from the coast by the Serra do Mar mountain range, called "Serra Paranapiacaba" by the Indians.
The settlement of the region's Courtyard of the College began in 1560.
During the visit of Mem de Sá, Governor-General of Brazil, the Captaincy of São Vicente, he ordered the transfer of the population of the Village of São Bernardo do Campo to the vicinity of the college.
It was then named "College of St. Paul of the Piratininga".
The new location was on a steep hill adjacent to a large wetland, the Várzea do Carmo.
It offered better protection from attacks by local Indian groups.
It was renamed Vila de São Paulo, belonging to the Captaincy of São Vicente.
For the next two centuries, São Paulo developed as a poor and isolated village that survived largely through the cultivation of subsistence crops by the labor of natives.
For a long time, São Paulo was the only village in Brazil's interior, as travel was too difficult for many to reach the area.
Mem de Sá forbade colonists to use the Caminho do Piraquê (Piraquê Path) and today known as Piaçaguera, because of frequent Indian raids along it.
On 22 March 1681, Luís Álvares de Castro, the Second Marquis de Cascais and donee of the Captaincy of São Vicente, moved the capital to the village of São Paulo (see Timeline of São Paulo), designating it the "Head of the captaincy".
The new capital was established on 23 April 1683, with public celebrations.
In the 17th century, São Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the Portuguese colony.
It was also the center of interior colonial development.
Because they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy African slaves, as did other Portuguese colonists.
The discovery of gold in the region of Minas Gerais, in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers to São Paulo.
The Captaincy of São Paulo and Minas de Ouro (see Captaincies of Brazil) was created on 3 November 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies of São Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.
Conveniently located in the country, up the steep Serra do Mar escarpment/mountain range when traveling from Santos, while also not too far from the coastline, São Paulo became a safe place to stay for tired travelers.
The town became a center for the bandeirantes, intrepid invaders who marched into unknown lands in search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to enslave.
The bandeirantes, which could be translated as "flag-bearers" or "flag-followers", organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown.
Trade grew from the local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers.
The bandeirantes eventually became politically powerful as a group, and forced the expulsion of the Jesuits from the city of São Paulo in 1640.
The two groups had frequently come into conflict because of the Jesuits' opposition to the domestic slave trade in Indians.
On 11 July 1711, the town of São Paulo was elevated to city status.
Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiabá and Goiânia.
The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the Tordesillas Line to incorporate the gold regions.
When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, São Paulo shifted to growing sugar cane.
Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy.
The sugar was exported through the Port of Santos.
At that time, the first modern highway between São Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Calçada do Lorena ("Lorena's settway").
Nowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of São Paulo, in the city of São Paulo, is called the Palácio dos Bandeirantes (Bandeirantes Palace), in the neighborhood of Morumbi.
After Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, as declared by Emperor Pedro I where the Monument to the Independence of Brazil is located, he named São Paulo as an Imperial City.
In 1827, a law school was founded at the Convent of São Francisco, today part of the University of São Paulo.
The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the city's growth, thanks to which the city became the Imperial City and Borough of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga.
The expansion of coffee production was a major factor in the growth of São Paulo, as it became the region's chief export crop and yielded good revenue.
It was cultivated initially in the Paraíba Valley region in the East of the State of São Paulo, and later on in the regions of Campinas, Rio Claro, São Carlos and Ribeirão Preto.
From 1869 onward, São Paulo was connected to the port of Santos by the Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundiaí (Santos-Jundiaí Railroad), nicknamed The Lady.
In the late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the state capital.
São Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads from the interior of the state.
Coffee was the economic engine for major economic and population growth in the State of São Paulo.
In 1888, the "Golden Law" (Lei Áurea) was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, abolishing the institution of slavery in Brazil.
Slaves were the main source of labor in the coffee plantations until then.
As a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many of whom settled in the capital.
The region's first industries also began to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to learn Portuguese.
By the time Brazil became a republic on 15 November 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of São Paulo's economy.
São Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an alliance that became known as "coffee and milk", given that Minas Gerais was famous for its dairy production.
During this period, São Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928.
Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population.
The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second Luz Station (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the Paulista Avenue in 1900, where they built many mansions.
Industrialization was the economic cycle that followed the coffee plantation model.
By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and São Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air.
The cultural scene followed modernist and naturalist tendencies in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century.
Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade, artists Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral and Lasar Segall, and sculptor Victor Brecheret.
The Modern Art Week of 1922 that took place at the Theatro Municipal was an event marked by avant-garde ideas and works of art.
In 1929, São Paulo won its first skyscraper, the Martinelli Building.
The modifications made in the city by Antônio da Silva Prado, Baron of Duprat and Washington Luís, who governed from 1899 to 1919, contributed to the climate development of the city; some scholars consider that the entire city was demolished and rebuilt at that time.
São Paulo's main economic activities derive from the services industry – factories are since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, consulting firms.
Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as Barra Funda and Brás.
Some cities around São Paulo, such as Diadema, São Bernardo do Campo, Santo André, and Cubatão are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.
In 1924 the city was the stage of the São Paulo Revolt, an armed conflict fought in working-class neighborhoods near the center of São Paulo that lasted 23 days, from 5 to 28 July, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured.
The confrontation between the federal troops of president Artur Bernardes against rebels of the Brazilian Army and the Public Force of São Paulo was classified by the federal government as a conspiracy, a mutiny and a "revolt against the Fatherland, without foundation, headed by disorderly members of the Brazilian Army".
To face the rebels, the federal government launched an indiscriminate artillery bombardment against the city, which affected mostly civilian targets; as a result of the bombing, a third of São Paulo's 700,000 inhabitants fled the city.
The revolt has been described as "the largest urban conflict in the history of Brazil".
In 1932, São Paulo mobilized in its largest civic movement: the Constitutionalist Revolution, when the entire population engaged in the war against the "Provisional Government" of Getúlio Vargas.
In 1934, with the reunion of some faculties created in the 19th century, the University of São Paulo (USP) was founded, today the largest in Brazil.
The first major project for industrial installation in the city was the industrial complex of Indústrias Matarazzo in Barra Funda.
In the 1930s, the Jafet brothers, operating in the fabric business, Rodolfo Crespi, the Puglisi Carbone brothers and the Klabin family, who would found the first large cellulose industry in Brazil, the Klabin.
Another major industrial boom occurred during the Second World War, due to the crisis in coffee farming in the 1930s and restrictions on international trade during the war, which resulted in the city having a very high economic growth rate that remained high in the post-war period.
In 1947, São Paulo gained its first paved highway: the Via Anchieta (built on the old route of José de Anchieta), connecting the capital to the coast of São Paulo.
In the 1950s, São Paulo was known as "the city that never stop" and as "the fastest growing city in the world".
São Paulo held a large celebration, in 1954, of the "Fourth Centenary" of the city's founding, when the Ibirapuera Park was inaugurated, many historical books are released and the source of the Tietê River in Salesópolis is discovered.
With the transfer of part of the city's financial center, which was located in the historic center (in the region called the "Historic Triangle"), to Paulista Avenue, its mansions were, for the most part, replaced by large buildings.
In the period from the 1930s to the 1960s, the great entrepreneurs of São Paulo's development were mayor Francisco Prestes Maia and the governor Ademar de Barros, who was also mayor of São Paulo between 1957 and 1961.
Prestes Maia designed and implemented, in the 1930s, the "Avenue Plan for the City of São Paulo", which revolutionized São Paulo's traffic.
These two rulers are also responsible for the two biggest urban interventions, after the Avenues Plan, which changed São Paulo: the rectification of the Tietê river with the construction of its banks and the São Paulo Metro: on February 13, 1963, governor Ademar de Barros and mayor Prestes Maia created study commissions (state and municipal) to prepare the basic project for the São Paulo Metro, and allocated their first funds to the Metro.
At the beginning of the 1960s, São Paulo already had four million inhabitants.
Construction of the metro began in 1968, under the administration of Mayor José Vicente de Faria Lima, and the commercial operation started on September 14, 1974.
In 2016 the system had a network 71.5 km long and 64 stations spread across five lines.
That year, 1.1 billion passengers were transported by the system.
At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, São Paulo became the main financial center in South America and one of the most populous cities in the world.
As the most influential Brazilian city on the global stage, São Paulo is currently classified as an alpha global city.
The metropolis has one of the largest GDP in the world, representing, alone, 11% of all Brazilian GDP, and is also responsible for one third of the Brazilian scientific production.
São Paulo is the capital of the most populous state in Brazil, São Paulo, located at latitude 23°33'01'' south and longitude 46°38'02'' west.
The total area of the municipality is 1,521.11 square kilometres (587.30 sq mi), according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), being the ninth largest in the state in terms of territorial extension.
Of the entire area of the municipality, 949,611 square kilometres (366,647 sq mi) are urban areas (2015), being the largest urban area in the country.
The city is on a plateau placed beyond the Serra do Mar (Portuguese for "Sea Range" or "Coastal Range"), itself a component of the vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands, with an average elevation of around 799 meters (2,621 ft) above sea level, although being at a distance of only about 70 kilometers (43 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean.
The distance is covered by two highways, the Anchieta and the Imigrantes, (see "Transportation" below) that roll down the range, leading to the port city of Santos and the beach resort of Guarujá.
Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of São Paulo except in its northern area, where the Serra da Cantareira Range reaches a higher elevation and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest.
The region is seismically stable and no significant activity has ever been recorded.
The Tietê River and its tributary, the Pinheiros River, were once important sources of fresh water and leisure for São Paulo.
However, heavy industrial effluents and wastewater discharges in the later 20th century caused the rivers to become heavily polluted.
A substantial clean-up program for both rivers is underway.
Neither river is navigable in the stretch that flows through the city, although water transportation becomes increasingly important on the Tietê river further downstream (near river Paraná), as the river is part of the River Plate basin.
No large natural lakes exist in the region, but the Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs in the city's southern outskirts are used for power generation, water storage and leisure activities, such as sailing.
The original flora consisted mainly of broadleaf evergreens.
Non-native species are common, as the mild climate and abundant rainfall permit a multitude of tropical, subtropical and temperate plants to be cultivated, especially the ubiquitous eucalyptus.
The north of the municipality contains part of the 7,917 hectares (19,560 acres)
Cantareira State Park, created in 1962, which protects a large part of the metropolitan São Paulo water supply.
In 2015, São Paulo experienced a major drought, which led several cities in the state to start a rationing system.
São Paulo is located in an ecotone area between 3 biomes: mixed ombrophilous forest, dense ombrophilous forest and cerrado; the latter had some plant species native to the pampas in the city.
There were several species typical of both biomes, among them we can mention: araucarias, pitangueiras, cambucís, ipês, jabuticabeiras, queen palms, muricís-do-campo, etc.
In 2010, São Paulo had 62 municipal and state parks, such as the Cantareira State Park, part of the São Paulo Green Belt Biosphere Reserve and home to one of the largest urban forests on the planet with 7,900 hectares (20,000 acres) of extension, the Fontes do Ipiranga State Park, the Ibirapuera Park, the Tietê Ecological Park, the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area, the Serra do Mar State Park, Villa-Lobos State Park, People's Park, and the Jaraguá State Park, listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994.
In 2009, São Paulo had 2,300 hectares (5,700 acres) of green area, less than 1.5% of the city's area and below the 12 square metres (130 sq ft) per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
About 21% of the municipality's area is covered by green areas, including ecological reserves (2010 data).
In the municipality it is possible to observe forest birds that usually appear in the spring, due to the belt of native forest that still surrounds the metropolitan region.
Species such as the rufous-bellied thrush, golden-chevroned tanager, great kiskadee and hummingbird are the most common.
Despite the intense pollution, the main rivers of the city, the Tietê and the Pinheiros, shelter several species of animals such as capybaras, hawks, southern lapwings, herons and nutrias.
Other species found in the municipality are the gray brocket, howler monkey, green-billed toucan and the Amazonian umbrellabird.
Air pollution in some districts of the city exceeds local standards, mainly due to car traffic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) sets a limit of 20 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air as a safe annual average.
In an assessment carried out by the WHO among over a thousand cities around the world in 2011, the city of São Paulo was ranked 268th among the most polluted, with an average rate of 38 micrograms per cubic meter, a rate well above the limit imposed by the organization, but lower than in other Brazilian cities, such as Rio de Janeiro (64 micrograms per cubic meter).
A 2013 study found that air pollution in the city causes more deaths than traffic accidents.
The stretch of the Tietê River that runs through the city is the most polluted river in Brazil.
In 1992, the Tietê Project began, with the aim to clean up the river by 2005.
8.8 billion reais was spent on the failed project.
In 2019, the Novo Rio Pinheiros Project began, under the administration of João Doria, with the aim to reduce sewage discharged into the Tietê's tributary, the Pinheiros River.
The problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: São Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins.
The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions.
With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.
According to the Köppen classification, the city has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa, bordering on Cwa).
In summer (January through March), the mean low temperature is about 19 °C (66 °F) and the mean high temperatures is near 28 °C (82 °F).
In winter, temperatures tend to range between 12 and 22 °C (54 and 72 °F).
The record high temperature was 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) on 17 October 2014 and the lowest −3.2 °C (26.2 °F) on 25 June 1918.
The Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23°27' S, passes through north of São Paulo and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas of South America.
Because of its elevation, however, São Paulo experiences a more temperate climate.
The summer is warm and rainy.
Autumn and spring are transitional seasons.
Winter is mild, but still the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequent polar air masses.
Frosts occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.
Rainfall is abundant, annually averaging 1,454 millimeters (57.2 in).
It is especially common in the warmer months averaging 219 millimeters (8.6 in) and decreases in winter, averaging 47 millimeters (1.9 in).
Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone and tornadic activity is uncommon.
During late winter, especially August, the city experiences the phenomenon known as "veranico" or "verãozinho" ("little summer"), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures well above 28 °C (82 °F).
On the other hand, relatively cool days during summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean.
On such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass 20 °C (68 °F), accompanied by lows often below 15 °C (59 °F), however, summer can be extremely hot when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around 34 °C (93 °F), but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the temperature can feel like 39 °C (102 °F), as on Paulista Avenue for example.
In the summer of 2014, São Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above 30 °C (86 °F), peaking on 36 °C (97 °F).
Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, São Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.
São Paulo's population has grown rapidly.
By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city.
By this time, the urbanized area of São Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million.
Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.
In 2010, the city had 2,146,077 opposite-sex couples and 7,532 same-sex couples.
The population of São Paulo was 52.6% female and 47.4% male.
The 2022 census found 6,214,422 White people (54.3%), 3,820,326 Pardo (multiracial) people (33.4%), 1,160,073 Black people (10.1%), 238,603 Asian people (2.1%) and 17,727 Amerindian people (0.2%).
São Paulo is considered the most multicultural city in Brazil.
From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million immigrants arrived in the state, from all parts of the world.
The Italian community is one of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city.
Of the 12 million inhabitants of São Paulo, 50% (6 million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry.
São Paulo has more descendants of Italians than any Italian city (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.8 million inhabitants).
The main groups, considering all the metropolitan area, are: 6 million people of Italian descent, 3 million people of Portuguese descent, 1.7 million people of African descent, 1 million people of Arab descent, 665,000 people of Japanese descent, 400,000 people of German descent, 250,000 people of French descent, 150,000 people of Greek descent, 120,000 people of Chinese descent, 120,000–300,000 Bolivian immigrants, 50,000 people of Korean descent, and 80,000 Jews.
Even today, Italians are grouped in neighborhoods like Bixiga, Brás, and Mooca to promote celebrations and festivals.
In the early twentieth century, Italian and its dialects were spoken almost as much as Portuguese in the city, which influenced the formation of the São Paulo dialect of today.
Six thousand pizzerias are producing about a million pizzas a day.
Brazil has the largest Italian population outside Italy, with São Paulo being the most populous city with Italian ancestry in the world.
The Portuguese community is also large; it is estimated that three million paulistanos have some origin in Portugal.
The Jewish colony is more than 80,000 people in São Paulo and is concentrated mainly in Higienópolis and Bom Retiro.
From the nineteenth century through the first half of the twentieth century, São Paulo also received German immigrants (in the current neighborhood of Santo Amaro), Spanish and Lithuanian (in the neighborhood Vila Zelina).
São Paulo also is home of the largest Japanese community outside Japan.
In 1958 the census counted 120,000 Japanese in the city and by 1987, there were 326,000 with another 170,000 in the surrounding areas within São Paulo state.
As of 2007, the Paulistano Japanese population outnumbered their fellow diaspora in the entirety of Peru, and in all individual American cities.
Research conducted by the University of São Paulo (USP) shows the city's high ethnic diversity: when asked if they are "descendants of foreign immigrants", 81% of the students reported "yes".
The main reported ancestries were: Italian (30.5%), Portuguese (23%), Spanish (14%), Japanese (8%), German (6%), Brazilian (4%), African (3%), Arab (2%) and Jewish (1%).
The city once attracted numerous immigrants from all over Brazil and even from foreign countries, due to a strong economy and for being the hub of most Brazilian companies.
São Paulo is also receiving waves of immigration from Haiti and from many countries of Africa and the Caribbean.
Those immigrants are mainly concentrated in Praça da Sé, Glicério and Vale do Anhangabaú in the Central Zone of São Paulo.
Since the 19th century people began migrating from northeastern Brazil into São Paulo.
This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades.
The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration.
The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Pari and Sé).
In this area they composed 41% of the population.
The nonspecific term "Grande São Paulo" ("Greater São Paulo") covers multiple definitions.
The legally defined Região Metropolitana de São Paulo consists of 39 municipalities in total and a population of 21.1 million inhabitants (as of the 2014 National Census).
The Metropolitan Region of São Paulo is known as the financial, economic, and cultural center of Brazil.
Among the largest municipalities, Guarulhos, with a population of more than 1 million people is the biggest one.
Several others count more than 100,000 inhabitants, such as São Bernardo do Campo (811,000 inh.)
and Santo André (707,000 inh.)
in the ABC Region.
The ABC Region, comprising Santo André, São Bernardo do Campo and São Caetano do Sul in the south of Grande São Paulo, is an important location for industrial corporations, such as Volkswagen and Ford Motors.
Because São Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo and the São Paulo Macrometropolis.
Analogous to the BosWash definition, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world, with 32 million inhabitants, behind Tokyo, which includes four contiguous legally defined metropolitan regions and three micro-regions.
Like the cultural variety verifiable in São Paulo, there are several religious manifestations present in the city.
Although it has developed on an eminently Catholic social matrix, both due to colonization and immigration – and even today most of the people of São Paulo declare themselves Roman Catholic – it is possible to find in the city dozens of different Protestant denominations, as well as the practice of Islam, Spiritism, among others.
Buddhism and Eastern religions also have relevance among the beliefs most practiced by Paulistanos.
It is estimated that there are more than one hundred thousand Buddhist and Hindu followers each.
Also considerable are Judaism, Mormonism and Afro-Brazilian religions.
According to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of São Paulo was 6,549,775 Roman Catholics (58.2%), 2,887,810 Protestants (22.1%), 531,822 Spiritists (4.7%), 101,493 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.9%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.7%), 50,794 Umbandists (0.5%), 43,610 Jews (0.4%), 28,673 Catholic Apostolic Brazilians (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 Candomblecists (0.2%), 17,321 Mormons (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 spiritualists (0.1%), 8,277 Muslims (0.1%), 7,139 esoteric (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (<0.1%) and 1,008 were Hindu (<0.1%).
Others 1,056 008 had no religion (9.4%), 149,628 followed other Christian religiosities (1.3%), 55,978 had an undetermined religion or multiple belonging (0.5%), 14,127 did not know (0.1%)
And 1,896 reported following other religiosities (<0.1%).
The Catholic Church divides the territory of the municipality of São Paulo into four ecclesiastical circumscriptions: the Archdiocese of São Paulo, and the adjacent Diocese of Santo Amaro, the Diocese of São Miguel Paulista and the Diocese of Campo Limpo, the last three suffragans of the first.
The archive of the archdiocese, called the Metropolitan Archival Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva, in the Ipiranga neighborhood, holds one of the most important documentary heritage in Brazil.
The archiepiscopal is the Metropolitan Cathedral of São Paulo (known as Sé Cathedral), in Praça da Sé, considered one of the five largest Gothic temples in the world.
The Catholic Church recognizes as patron saints of the city Saint Paul of Tarsus and Our Lady of Penha of France.
The city has the most diverse Protestant or Reformed creeds, such as the Evangelical Community of Our Land, Maranatha Christian Church, Lutheran Church, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church, Anglican Episcopal Church, Baptist churches, Assemblies of God in Brazil (the largest evangelical church in the country), The Seventh-day Adventist Church, the World Church of God's Power, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others, as well as Christians of various denominations.
In 2008, the city of São Paulo ranked 493rd on the list of the most violent cities in Brazil.
Among the capitals, it was the fourth least violent, registering, in 2006, homicide rates higher only than those of Boa Vista, Palmas and Natal.
In November 2009, the Ministry of Justice and the Brazilian Public Security Forum released a survey that identified São Paulo as the safest Brazilian capital for young people.
Between 2000 and 2010, the city of São Paulo reduced its homicide rate by 78%.
According to the 2011 Global Homicide Study, released by the United Nations (UN), in the period between 2004 and 2009 the homicide rate fell from 20.8 to 10.8 murders per hundred thousand inhabitants.
In 2011, the UN pointed to São Paulo as an example of how large cities can reduce crime.
In a survey on the Adolescent Homicide Index (AHI) in 2010, the city of São Paulo was considered the least lethal for adolescents, among 283 municipalities surveyed, with more than 100,000 inhabitants.
According to data from the "Map of Violence 2011", published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city had the lowest homicide rate per hundred thousand inhabitants that year among all the state capitals in Brazil.
Crime indicators, such as homicide, according to data from April 2017, showed a reduction in the capital of São Paulo, compared to 2016.
In the same period, there was a 12.64% reduction in homicides, the number of robbery records fell by eleven to seven (34% reduction), and there was an 8.09% reduction in rape cases.
The 9th DP in the Carandiru neighborhood was considered, in March 2007, one of the five best police stations in the world and the best in Latin America.
Based on data from IBGE and the Ministry of Health, it is considered the 2nd safest capital and the least lethal capital in the country, according to the 2023 Brazilian Public Security Yearbook.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America.
During two World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected.
This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned São Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.
Crime rates consistently decreased in the 21st century.
The citywide homicide rate was 6.56 in 2019, less than a fourth of the 27.38 national rate.
Air quality has steadily increased during the modern era.
The two major rivers crossing the city, Tietê and Pinheiros, are highly polluted.
A major project to clean up these rivers is underway.
The Clean City Law or antibillboard, approved in 2007, focused on two main targets: anti-publicity and anti-commerce.
Advertisers estimate that they removed 15,000 billboards and that more than 1,600 signs and 1,300 towering metal panels were dismantled by authorities.
São Paulo metropolitan region, adopted vehicle restrictions from 1996 to 1998 to reduce air pollution during wintertime.
Since 1997, a similar project was implemented throughout the year in the central area of São Paulo to improve traffic.
There were more than 30,000 homeless people in 2021 according to official data.
It increased by 31% in two years, and doubled in 20 years.
The primary language is Portuguese.
The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River.
In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil.
From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools.
The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct.
Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.
The Italian influence in São Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods such as Bela Vista, Mooca, Brás and Lapa.
Italian mingled with Portuguese and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language.
The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs of Adoniran Barbosa, a Brazilian samba singer born to Italian parents who used to sing using the local accent.
Other languages spoken in the city are mainly among the Asian community: São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan.
Although today most Japanese-Brazilians speak only Portuguese, some of them are still fluent in Japanese.
Some people of Chinese and Korean descent are still able to speak their ancestral languages.
In some areas it is still possible to find descendants of immigrants who speak German (especially in the area of Brooklin paulista) and Lithuanian or Russian or East European languages (especially in the area of Vila Zelina).
In the west zone of São Paulo, specially at Vila Anastácio and Lapa region, there is a Hungarian colony, with three churches (Calvinist, Baptist and Catholic), so on Sundays it is possible to see Hungarians talking to each other on sidewalks.

Same-sex civil unions have been legal in the whole country since 5 May 2011, while same-sex marriage in São Paulo was legalized on 18 December 2012.
Since 1997, the city has hosted the annual São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, considered the biggest pride parade in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records with over 5 million participants, and typically rivalling the New York City Pride March for the record.
Strongly supported by the State and the City of São Paulo government authorities, in 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$1 million reais in the parade and provided a solid security plan, with approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds.
The parade, considered the city's second largest event after the Formula One, begins at the São Paulo Museum of Art, crosses Paulista Avenue, and follows Consolação Street to Praça Roosevelt in Downtown São Paulo.
According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best in the world.
São Paulo has public and private primary and secondary schools and vocational-technical schools.
More than nine-tenths of the population are literate and roughly the same proportion of those age 7 to 14 are enrolled in school.
There are 578 universities in the state of São Paulo.
The city of São Paulo is also home to research and development facilities and attracts companies due to the presence of regionally renowned universities.
Science, technology and innovation is leveraged by the allocation of funds from the state government, mainly carried out by means of the Foundation to Research Support in the State of São Paulo (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo – FAPESP), one of the main agencies promoting scientific and technological research.
São Paulo is one of the largest health care hubs in Latin America.
Among its hospitals are the Albert Einstein Israelites Hospital, ranked the best hospital in all Latin America and the Hospital das Clínicas, the largest in the region, with a total area of 600,000 square meters and offers 2,400 beds, distributed among its eight specialized institutes and two assisting hospitals.

As the capital of the state of São Paulo, the city is home to the Bandeirantes Palace (state government) and the Legislative Assembly.
The Executive Branch of the municipality of São Paulo is represented by the mayor and his cabinet of secretaries, following the model proposed by the Federal Constitution.
The organic law of the municipality and the Master Plan of the city, however, determine that the public administration must guarantee to the population effective tools of manifestation of participatory democracy, which causes that the city is divided in regional prefectures, each one led by a Regional Mayor appointed by the Mayor.
The legislative power is represented by the Municipal Chamber, composed of 55 aldermen elected to four-year posts (in compliance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Constitution, which dictates a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants).
It is up to the house to draft and vote fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the municipal budget (known as the Law of Budgetary Guidelines).
In addition to the legislative process and the work of the secretariats, there are also a number of municipal councils, each dealing with different topics, composed of representatives of the various sectors of organized civil society.
The actual performance and representativeness of such councils, however, are sometimes questioned.
São Paulo Turismo S/A (SPTuris): company responsible for organizing large events and promoting the city's tourism.
Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego (CET): subordinated to the Municipal Transportation Department, is responsible for traffic supervision, fines (in cooperation with DETRAN) and maintenance of the city's road system.
Companhia Metropolitana de Habitação de São Paulo (COHAB): subordinate to the Department of Housing, is responsible for the implementation of public housing policies, especially the construction of housing developments.
Empresa Municipal de Urbanização de São Paulo (EMURB): subordinate to the Planning Department, is responsible for urban works and for the maintenance of public spaces and urban furniture.

São Paulo is divided into 32 subprefectures, each with an administration ("subprefeitura") divided into several districts ("distritos").
The city also has a radial division into nine zones for purpose of traffic control and bus lines, which do not fit into the administrative divisions.
These zones are identified by colors in the street signs.
The historical core of São Paulo, which includes the inner city and the area of Paulista Avenue, is in the Subprefecture of Sé.
Most other economic and tourist facilities of the city are inside an area officially called Centro Expandido (Portuguese for "Broad Center", or "Broad Downtown"), which includes Sé and several other subprefectures, and areas immediately around it.
São Paulo is Brazil's highest GDP city and one of the largest in the world.
According to data from the IBGE, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was R$450 billion, approximately US$220 billion, 12.26% of Brazilian GDP and 36% of the São Paulo state's GDP.
The per capita income for the city was R$32,493 in 2008.
São Paulo is considered the financial capital of Brazil, as it is the location for the headquarters of major corporations and of banks and financial institutions.
The city is the headquarters of B3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization, and has several financial districts, mainly in the areas around Paulista, Faria Lima and Berrini avenues.

The top five commodities exported by São Paulo are soybean (21%), raw sugar (19%), coffee (6.5%), sulfate chemical wood pulp (5.6%), and corn (4.4%).
São Paulo's economy is going through a deep transformation.
Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services.
São Paulo also has a large "informal" economy.
According to PricewaterhouseCoopers average annual economic growth of the city is 4.2%.

According to Mercer's 2011 city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, São Paulo is among the ten most expensive cities in the world.
Luxury brands tend to concentrate their business in São Paulo.
Because of the lack of department stores and multi-brand boutiques, shopping malls as well as the Jardins district attract most of the world's luxurious brands.
Most of the international luxury brands can be found in the Iguatemi, Cidade Jardim or JK shopping malls or on the streets of Oscar Freire, Lorena or Haddock Lobo in the Jardins district.
They are home of brands such as Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Tiffany & Co.
Cidade Jardim was opened in São Paulo in 2008, it is a 45,000-square-meter (484,376-square-foot) mall, landscaped with trees and greenery scenario, with a focus on Brazilian brands but also home to international luxury brands such as Hermès, Jimmy Choo, Pucci and Carolina Herrera.
Opened in 2012, JK shopping mall has brought to Brazil brands that were not present in the country before such as Goyard, Tory Burch, Llc., Prada, and Miu Miu.
The Iguatemi Faria Lima, in Faria Lima Avenue, is Brazil's oldest mall, opened in 1966.
The Jardins neighborhood is regarded among the most sophisticated places in town, with upscale restaurants and hotels.
The New York Times once compared Oscar Freire Street to Rodeo Drive.
In Jardins there are luxury car dealers.
One of the world's best restaurants as elected by The World's 50 Best Restaurants Award, D.O.M., is there.
Large hotel chains whose target audience is the corporate traveler are in the city.

The city also promotes one of the most important fashion weeks in the world, São Paulo Fashion Week, established in 1996 under the name Morumbi Fashion Brasil, is the largest and most important fashion event in Latin America.
Besides, the São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, held since 1997 on Paulista Avenue is the event that attracts more tourists to the city.

In addition, São Paulo hosts the annual São Paulo Pancake Cook-Off in which chefs from across Brazil and the world participate in competitions based on the cooking of pancakes.
Cultural tourism also has relevance to the city, especially when considering the international events in the metropolis, such as the São Paulo Art Biennial, that attracted almost 1 million people in 2004.
The city has a nightlife that is considered one of the best in the country, and is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.
There are cinemas, theaters, museums, and cultural centers.
The Rua Oscar Freire was named one of the eight most luxurious streets in the world, according to the Mystery Shopping International, and São Paulo the 25th "most expensive city" of the planet.
According to the International Congress & Convention Association, São Paulo ranks first among the cities that host international events in Americas and the 12th in the world, after Vienna, Paris, Barcelona, Singapore, Berlin, Budapest, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Seoul, Lisbon, and Copenhagen.
According to a study by MasterCard in 130 cities around the world, São Paulo was the third most visited destination in Latin America (behind Mexico City and Buenos Aires) with 2.4 million foreign travelers, who spent US$2.9 billion in 2013 (the highest among the cities in the region).
In 2014, CNN ranked nightlife São Paulo as the fourth best in the world, behind New York City, Berlin and Ibiza, in Spain.
The cuisine of the region is a tourist attraction.
The city has 62 cuisines across 12,000 restaurants.
During the 10th International Congress of Gastronomy, Hospitality and Tourism (Cihat) conducted in 1997, the city received the title of "World Gastronomy Capital" from a commission formed by 43 nations' representatives.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of Latin America.
With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil.
The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy) and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.
From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.
The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.
São Paulo is practically all served by the water supply network.
The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day.
The water loss is 30.8%.
However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches.
Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated.
According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households.
The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%.
Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus.
About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.
Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.
São Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics.
The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis.
Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a "low-rise building" city.
Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty.
Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings Emporis Buildings, besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as Palácio Zarzur Kogan, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.
Such tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine.
Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities.
The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century.
With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.
São Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia.
However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.
Urban growth in São Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.
Thus, São Paulo differs considerably from other Brazilian cities such as Belo Horizonte and Goiânia, whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan, or a city like Brasília, whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction.
The effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable.
Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes.
In São Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of "demolish and rebuild", including former Mayor Francisco Prestes Maia's road plan for São Paulo (known as the Avenues Plan) or Saturnino de Brito's plan for the Tietê River.
The Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts.
This plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods.
The plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system.
This contributed to the outwards expansion of São Paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents.
Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of self-built single-family houses.
In 1968 the Urban Development Plan proposed the Basic Plan for Integrated Development of São Paulo, under the administration of Figueiredo Ferraz.
The main result was zoning laws.
It lasted until 2004 when the Basic Plan was replaced by the current Master Plan.
That zoning, adopted in 1972, designated "Z1" areas (residential areas designed for elites) and "Z3" (a "mixed zone" lacking clear definitions about their characteristics).
Zoning encouraged the growth of suburbs with minimal control and major speculation.
After the 1970s peripheral lot regulation increased and infrastructure in the periphery improved, driving land prices up.
The poorest and the newcomers now could not purchase their lot and build their house, and were forced to look for a housing alternative.
As a result, favelas and precarious tenements (cortiços) appeared.
These housing types were often closer to the city's center: favelas could sprawl in any unused terrain (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city.
Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.
By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo's population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980.
Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area's population.
São Paulo has two main airports, São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport for international flights and national hub, and São Paulo–Congonhas Airport for domestic and regional flights.
Another airport, the Campo de Marte Airport, serves private jets and light aircraft.
The three airports together moved more than 58.000.000 passengers in 2015, making São Paulo one of the top 15 busiest in the world, by number of air passenger movements.
The region of Greater São Paulo is also served by Viracopos International Airport, São José dos Campos Airport and Jundiaí Airport.
Congonhas Airport operates flights mainly to Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte and Brasília.
Built in the 1930s, it was designed to handle the increasing demand for flights, in the fastest growing city in the world.
Located in Campo Belo District, Congonhas Airport is close to the three main city's financial districts: Paulista Avenue, Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue and Engenheiro Luís Carlos Berrini Avenue.
The São Paulo–Guarulhos International, also known as "Cumbica", is 25 km (16 mi) north-east of the city center, in the neighboring city of Guarulhos.
Every day nearly 110.000 people pass through the airport, which connects Brazil to 36 countries around the world.
370 companies operate there, generating more than 53.000 jobs.
The international airport is connected to the metropolitan rail system, with Line 13 (CPTM).
Campo de Marte is in Santana district, the northern zone of São Paulo.
The airport handles private flights and air shuttles, including air taxi firms.
Opened in 1935, Campo de Marte is the base for the largest helicopter fleet in Brazil and the world's, ahead of New York and Tokyo.
This airport is the home base of the State Civil Police Air Tactical Unit, the State Military Police Radio Patrol Unit and the São Paulo Flying Club.
From this airport, passengers can take advantage of some 350 remote helipads and heliports to bypass heavy road traffic.
Automobiles are the main means to get into the city.
In March 2011, more than 7 million vehicles were registered.
Heavy traffic is common on the city's main avenues and traffic jams are relatively common on its highways.
The city is crossed by 10 major motorways: President Dutra Highway/BR-116 (connects São Paulo to the east and north-east of the country);
Régis Bittencourt Highway/BR-116 (connects São Paulo to the south of the country); Fernão Dias Highway/BR-381 (connects São Paulo to the north of the country); Anchieta Highway/SP-150 (connects São Paulo to the ocean coast); Immigrants Highway/SP-150 (connects São Paulo to the ocean coast);

Bandeirantes Highway/SP-348 (connects São Paulo to the north-west of the country); Ayrton Senna Highway/SP-70 (named after Brazilian legendary Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, the motorway connects São Paulo to east locations of the state, as well as the north coast of the state).
The Rodoanel Mário Covas (official designation SP-021) is the beltway of the Greater São Paulo.
Upon its completion, it will have a length of 177 km (110 mi), with a radius of approximately 23 km (14 mi) from the geographical center of the city.
It was named after Mário Covas, who was mayor of the city of São Paulo (1983–1985) and a state governor (1994-1998/1998-2001) until his death from cancer.
It is a controlled access highway with a speed limit of 100 km/h (62 mph) under normal weather and traffic circumstances.
The west, south and east parts are completed, and the north part, which will close the beltway, is due in 2022 and is being built by DERSA.
Bus transport (government and private) is composed of 17,000 buses (including about 290 trolley buses).
The traditional system of informal transport (dab vans) was later reorganized and legalized.
The trolleybus systems provide a portion of the public transport service in Greater São Paulo with two independent networks.
The SPTrans (São Paulo Transportes) system opened in 1949 and serves the city of São Paulo, while the Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de São Paulo (EMTU) system opened in 1988 and serves suburban areas to the southeast of the city proper.
Worldwide, São Paulo is one of only two metropolitan areas possessing two independent trolleybus systems, the other being Naples, Italy.
São Paulo Tietê Bus Terminal is the second largest bus terminal in the world, after PABT in New York.
It serves localities across the nation, with the exception of the states of Amazonas, Roraima and Amapá.
Routes to 1,010 cities in five countries (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay) are available.
It connects to all regional airports and a ride sharing automobile service to Santos.
The Palmeiras-Barra Funda Intermodal Terminal is much smaller and is connected to the Palmeiras-Barra Funda metro and Palmeiras-Barra Funda CPTM stations.
It serves the southwestern cities of Sorocaba, Itapetininga, Itu, Botucatu, Bauru, Marília, Jaú, Avaré, Piraju, Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo, Ipaussu, Chavantes and Ourinhos (on the border with Paraná State).
It also serves São José do Rio Preto, Araçatuba and other small towns on the northwest of São Paulo State.
São Paulo has an urban rail transit system (São Paulo Metro and São Paulo Metropolitan Trains) that serves 184 stations and has 377 km (234 mi) of track, forming the largest metropolitan rail transport network of Latin America.
The underground and urban railway lines together carry some 7 million people on an average weekday.
The São Paulo Metro operates 104 kilometers (65 mi) of rapid transit system, with six lines in operation, serving 91 stations.
In 2015, the metro reached the mark of 11.5 million passengers per mile of line, 15% higher than in 2008, when 10 million users were taken per mile.
It is the largest concentration of people in a single transport system in the world, according to the company.
In 2014, the São Paulo Metro was elected the best metro system in the Americas.
The company ViaQuatro, a private concessionaire, operates the Line 4 of the metro system.
The Line 15 (Silver) is the first mass-transit monorail of the South America and the first system in the world to use the Bombardier Innovia Monorail 300.
When fully completed will be the largest and highest capacity monorail system in the Americas and second worldwide, only behind to the Chongqing Monorail.
The Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM, or "Paulista Company of Metropolitan Trains") railway add 273.0 km (169.6 mi) of commuter rail, with seven lines and 94 stations.
The system carries about 2.8 million passengers a day.
On 8 June 2018, CPTM set a weekday ridership record with 3,096,035 trips.
The Line 13 (Jade) of the CPTM connects São Paulo to the São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, in the municipality of Guarulhos, the first major international airport in South America to be directly served by train.
CCR Group (through the ViaQuatro and ViaMobilidade concessionaires) operates subway lines 4–Yellow and 5–Lilac, in addition to managing (through the ViaMobilidade concessionaire) lines 8-Diamond and 9-Emerald of the metropolitan train system.
Metro and metropolitan train networks transport an average of nearly 7 million people a day, while another 2 million passengers are transported by EMTU buses daily.
The two major São Paulo railway stations are Luz and Júlio Prestes in the Luz/Campos Eliseos region.
Julio Prestes Station connected Southwest São Paulo State and Northern Paraná State to São Paulo City.
Agricultural products were transferred to Luz Station from which they headed to the Atlantic Ocean and overseas.
Júlio Prestes stopped transporting passengers through the Sorocabana or FEPASA lines and now only has metro service.
Due to its acoustics and interior beauty, surrounded by Greek revival columns, part of the rebuilt station was transformed into the São Paulo Hall.
Luz Station was built in Britain and assembled in Brazil.
It has an underground station and is still active with metro lines that link São Paulo to the Greater São Paulo region to the East and the Campinas Metropolitan region in Jundiaí in the western part of the State.
Luz Station is surrounded by important cultural institutions such as the Pinacoteca do Estado, The Museu de Arte Sacra on Tiradentes Avenue and Jardim da Luz, among others.
It is the seat of the Santos-Jundiaí line which historically transported international immigrants from the Port of Santos to São Paulo and the coffee plantation lands in the Western region of Campinas.
São Paulo has no tram lines, although trams were common in the first half of the 20th century.
Adoniran Barbosa was a samba singer and composer who became successful during São Paulo's early radio era.
Born in 1912 in the town of Valinhos, Barbosa was known as the "composer to the masses", particularly Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bela Vista, also known as "Bexiga" and Brás, as well as those who lived in the city's many 'cortiços' or tenements.
His songs drew from the life of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge.
His first big hit was "Saudosa Maloca" ("Shanty of Fond Memories" – 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building.
His 1964 Trem das Onze ("The 11 pm Train"), became one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the Jaçanã suburb, for his mother will not sleep before he arrives home.
Another important musician with a similar style is Paulo Vanzolini.
Vanzolini is a PhD in biology and a part-time professional musician.
He composed a song depicting a love murder scene in São Paulo called "Ronda".
In the late 1960s, a psychedelic rock band called Os Mutantes became popular.
Their success is related to that of other tropicalia musicians.
The group was known as very paulistanos in its behavior and clothing.
Os Mutantes released five albums before lead singer Rita Lee departed in 1972 to join another group called Tutti Frutti.
Although initially known only in Brazil, Os Mutantes became successful abroad after the 1990s.
In 2000, Tecnicolor, an album recorded in the early 1970s in English by the band, was released with artwork designed by Sean Lennon.
In the early 1980s, a band called Ultraje a Rigor (Elegant Outrage) emerged.
They played a simple and irreverent style of rock.
The lyrics depicted the changes in society and culture that Brazilian society was experiencing.
A late punk and garage scene became strong in the 1980s, perhaps associated with the gloomy scenario of unemployment during an extended recession.
Bands originating from this movement include Ira!, Titãs, Ratos de Porão and Inocentes.
In the 1990s, drum and bass arose as another musical movement in São Paulo, with artists such as DJ Marky, DJ Patife, XRS, Drumagick and Fernanda Porto.
Many heavy metal bands also originated in São Paulo, such as Angra, Project46, Torture Squad, Korzus and Dr. Sin.
Famous electro-pop band Cansei de Ser Sexy, or CSS (Portuguese for "tired of being sexy") also has its origins in the city.
Many of the most important classical Brazilian living composers, such as Amaral Vieira, Osvaldo Lacerda and Edson Zampronha, were born and live in São Paulo.
Local baritone Paulo Szot has won international acclaim performing for six consecutive seasons at The Metropolitan Opera, La Scala and Opera de Paris, among others; and The Tony Award for best actor in a musical for his performance in a 2008 revival of South Pacific.
The São Paulo State Symphony is one of the world's outstanding orchestras; their artistic director beginning in 2012 is the noted American conductor Marin Alsop.
In 1952, Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote his Symphony Number 10 ('Ameríndia') for the 400th anniversary of São Paulo: an allegorical, historical and religious account of the city told through the eyes of its founder José de Anchieta.
São Paulo's opera houses are: São Paulo Municipal Theater, Theatro São Pedro and Alfa Theater, for the symphonic concerts there is the Sala São Paulo, the latter being the headquarters of OSESP, an orchestra.
The city hosts several music halls.
The main ones are: Citibank Hall, HSBC Music Hall, Olympia, Via Funchal, Villa Country, Arena Anhembi and Espaco das Américas.
The Anhembi Sambadrome hosts musical presentations as well, in addition to the Carnival of São Paulo.
Other facilities include the new Praça das Artes, with the Municipal Conservatory of Music Chamber Hall and others venues, like, Cultura Artistica, Teatro Sérgio Cardoso with a venue for only dance performances and Herzog & DeMeron's Centro Cultural Luz, for Ballet, Opera, theater and concerts, with three huge halls.
The auditorium of the Latin-American Cultural Center, The Mozarteum, holds concerts through the year.
Festivals as the Virada Cultural (Cultural Overnight) happen once a year and holds hundreds of attractions spread throughout the city.
São Paulo was home to the first Jesuit missionaries in Brazil, in the early 16th century.
They wrote reports to the Portuguese crown about the newly found land, the native peoples and composed poetry and music for the catechism, creating the first written works from the area.
The literary priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and José de Anchieta, living in or near the colony then called Piratininga.
They also helped to register the Old Tupi language, lexicon and its grammar.
In 1922, the Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in São Paulo, began to achieve cultural independence.
Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural independence came more gradually.
Brazilian elite culture was originally strongly tied to Portugal.
Gradually writers developed a multi-ethnic body of work that was distinctively Brazilian.
The presence of large numbers of former slaves added a distinctive African character to the culture.
Subsequent infusions of immigrants of non-Portuguese origin broadened the range of influences.
Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade were the prototypical modernists.
With the urban poems of "Paulicéia Desvairada" and "Carefree Paulistan land" (1922), Mário de Andrade established the movement in Brazil.
His rhapsodic novel Macunaíma (1928), with its abundance of Brazilian folklore, represents the apex of modernism's nationalist prose through its creation of an offbeat native national hero.
Oswald de Andrade's experimental poetry, avant-garde prose, particularly the novel Serafim Ponte Grande (1933) and provocative manifestos exemplify the movement's break with tradition.
Modernist artists and writers chose the Municipal Theatre of São Paulo to launch their Modernist manifesto.
The site happened to be a bastion of European culture with opera and classical music presentations from Germany, France, Austria and Italy.
They defied the high society that frequented the venue and who insisted on speaking only foreign languages such as French, behaving as if Brazilian culture did not matter.
Many historians believe that the first theatrical performance in Brazil was held in São Paulo.
The Portuguese Jesuit missionary José de Anchieta (1534–1597) wrote short plays that were performed and watched by the Tupi–Guarani natives.
In the second half of the 19th century a cultural, musical and theatrical life emerged.
European ethnic groups began holding performances in some of the state's rural cities.
The most important period for the art in São Paulo was the 1940s.
São Paulo had had a professional company, Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia, (Brazilian Theater of Comedy), along with others.
During the 1960s, major theater productions in São Paulo and Brazil were presented by two groups.
Teatro de Arena began with a group of students from Escola de Arte Dramática (Drama Art School), founded by Alfredo Mesquita, in 1948.
In 1958, the group excelled with the play "Eles não usam black tie" by Gianfrancesco Guarnieri which was the first in the history of the Brazilian drama to feature labor workers as protagonists.
After the military coup of 1964, plays started focusing on Brazilian history (Zumbi, Tiradentes).
Teatro de Arena and Teatro Oficina supported the democratic resistance during the military dictatorship period, marked by its censorship.
The Tropicalist movement began there.
A number of plays represented historic moments, notably "O Rei da Vela", "Galileu Galilei" (1968), "Na Selva das Cidades" (1969) and "Gracias Señor" (1972).
The district of Bixiga concentrates the greatest number of theaters, around 40 including the theaters that are closed for refurbishing or for other reasons, and small alternatives companies venues.
Some of the most important are Renault, Brigadeiro, Zaccaro, Bibi Ferreira, Maria della Costa, Ruth Escobar, Opera, TBC, Imprensa, Oficina, Àgora, Cacilda Becker, Sérgio Cardoso, do Bixiga, and Bandeirantes.
São Paulo has many neighborhoods and buildings of historical value.
The city has a large number of museums and art galleries.
Among the museums in the city are São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP), the Ipiranga Museum, the Museum of Sacred Art, the Museum of the Portuguese Language, the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo, among other renowned institutions.
It also houses one of the top five zoos in the world, the São Paulo Zoo.
The Ipiranga Museum is the first monument built to preserve the memory of the Independence of Brazil, opened on 7 September 1895, with the name of Natural Science Museum].
In 1919, it became a history museum.
Reflecting the architectural influence of the Versailles Palace in France, the Ipiranga's collection, with approximately 100,000 pieces, comprises works of art, furniture, clothing and appliances that belonged to those who took part in Brazilian history, such as explorers, rulers and freedom fighters.
Its facilities house a library with 100,000 books and the "Centro de Documentação Histórica", Historic Documentation Center, with 40,000 manuscripts.
The Ema Gordon Klabin Cultural Foundation opened to the public in March 2007.
Its headquarters is a 1920s mansion.
It houses 1545 works, including paintings by Marc Chagall, Pompeo Batoni, Pierre Gobert and Frans Post, Brazilian modernists Tarsila do Amaral, Di Cavalcanti and Portinari, period furniture, decorative and archeological pieces.
Stretching over 78 thousand square meters (0.84 million square feet), Memorial da América Latina (Latin America's Memorial) was conceived to showcase Latin American countries and their roots and cultures.
It is home to the headquarters of Parlamento Latino-Americano – Parlatino (Latin American Parliament).
Designed by Oscar Niemeyer, Memorial has an exhibition pavilion with permanent exhibition of the continent's craftwork production; a library with books, newspapers, magazines, videos, films and records about the history of Latin America; and a 1,679-seat auditorium.
Hospedaria do Imigrante (Immigrant's Hostel) was built in 1886 and opened in 1887.
Immigrant's Hostel was built in Brás to welcome the immigrants who arrived in Brazil through the Port of Santos, quarantining those who were sick and helping new arrivals to find work in coffee plantations in Western, Northern and Southwestern São Paulo State and Northern Paraná State.
From 1882 to 1978, 2.5 million immigrants of more than 60 nationalities and ethnicities were guests there, all of them duly registered in the museum's books and lists.
The hostel hosted approximately 3,000 people on average, but occasionally reached 8,000.
The hostel received the last immigrants in 1978.
In 1998 the hostel became a museum, where it preserves the immigrants' documentation, memory and objects.
Located in one of the few remaining centenarian buildings, the museum occupies part of the former hostel.
The museum also restores wooden train wagons from the former São Paulo Railway.
Two restored wagons inhabit the museum.
One dates from 1914, while a second class passenger car dates from 1931.
The museum records the names of all immigrants who were hosted there from 1888 to 1978.
MASP has one of world's most important collections of European art.
The most important collections cover Italian and French painting schools.
The museum was founded by Assis Chateaubriand and is directed by Pietro Maria Bardi.
Its headquarters, opened in 1968, were designed by Lina Bo Bardi.
MASP organizes temporary exhibitions in special areas.
Brazilian and international exhibitions of contemporary arts, photography, design and architecture take turn during the whole year.
Located next to the Luz metro station, the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo was projected by architect Ramos de Azevedo in 1895.
It was constructed to house an Arts Lyceum.

The torpedo body style was a type of automobile body used from 1908 until the mid-1930s, which had a streamlined profile and a folding or detachable soft top.
The design consists of a hood or bonnet line raised to be level with the car's waistline, resulting in a straight beltline from front to back.
The name was introduced in 1908 when Captain Theo Masui, the London-based importer of French Gregoire cars, designed a streamlined body and called it "The Torpedo".
The Torpedo body style was usually fitted to four- or five-seat touring cars (cars without a fixed roof) with detachable or folding roof, and low side panels and doors.
Torpedo cars did not have B pillars, so the only uprights present were those supporting the windshield.
Similar styles are phaeton and baquet.
The name is also used for trucks with a hood or bonnet.
A tonneau (US:  or UK: ) is an area of a car, truck, or boat open at the top.
It can be for passengers or cargo.
When applied to trucks it refers to their bed (American English) or tray (British English).
A tonneau was originally an open rear passenger compartment, rounded like a barrel, on an automobile and, by extension, a body style incorporating such a compartment.
The word is French, meaning 'cask' or barrel, cf.
Early tonneaus normally had a rear-facing hinged door, but single and dual side doors were soon introduced.
When the street was muddy or dirty, the car could be backed up to the curb so tonneau passengers could exit directly onto the sidewalk.
Historically, tonneau cover referred to a flexible temporary cover (typically made out of leather or canvas) for an open area of a vehicle.
In current automotive terminology it typically refers to a hard or soft cover that spans the back of a pickup truck to protect the load from weather elements or thieves, or to improve aerodynamics.
Tonneau covers come in many styles that fold, retract, or tilt open, and can be locked shut.
Common materials used include steel, aluminium, canvas, PVC, fibreglass, and carbon fibre.
Tonneau covers are also used to cover and protect open areas of boats.
Many of these covers are made of waterproofed canvas and are held in place by snaps.
Modern hard tonneau covers open by a hinging or folding mechanism, while segmented or soft covers open by rolling up or folding.
Hard folding covers are more popular to truck owners as they offer better protection, security, and waterproofness.
Truck and car tonneau covers keep items out of the weather and out of the sight of potential thieves.
The year and model of your truck determine the size of your tonneau.
Many dealers will recommend using a tape measure to measure the truck bed.
Early open-bodied touring-type automobiles used tonneau covers to protect unoccupied rear seats.
As early as the 1930s, lakes racers, searching for an extra competitive edge, imitated early automobile construction and skinned the cockpits of their roadsters and streamliners with removable canvas.
The skins covered gaping cockpits that would otherwise disturb airflow and create undue drag; as a result, tonneau-equipped cars ultimately went faster with a given amount of power.
Tonneau covers are used in lieu of hard or soft convertible tops on open sports cars such as the MG, Triumph, Austin-Healey, and Porsche Boxster.
These covers, often made of natural or artificial leather, cover the entire passenger compartment, and are zippered so the driver's seat can be uncovered while the rest of the interior remains covered.
Tonneau covers are used in coupé utility cars and pickup trucks to cover and secure the cargo bed and come in a variety of styles.
Mainly they are categorized by material Soft or Hard covers.
Soft covers can be rollup or folding and Hard covers are rollup, folding or one piece.
The most common style is the roll-up tonneau made from cloth or vinyl, which uses a rib-like structure to support the fabric and keep it taut and roll up toward the cab of the truck.
A snap-based system is also used, but has become less common due to truck owners not wanting to install the snaps on their vehicle as they typically require drilling or permanent adhesive.
Hard roll-up tonneau covers are more firm than regular roll-up tonneau covers.
They are made of a wall of individual aluminum slats, covered with soft vinyl.
In the unrolled position, these aluminium slats form a hard aluminium shell, which not only covers the cargo inside the bed, but also may support loads up 400 pounds on top of it.
Another style of truck bed tonneau cover is a retractable unit, which is mounted at the front and sides of the bed and rolls up or retracts from the tailgate towards the cab.
The retractable tonneau is typically made of vinyl, plastic or aluminium.
Retractable tonneaus are more secure than soft tonneau covers, since they usually lock and are made from a harder composition, but they take more time to install and are designed for  semi-permanent installation.
Fiberglass, hard plastic, or aluminium tonneau covers are also common.
Some may be painted to match the truck, are solid in construction, and can be locked.
These covers are usually heavy and require gas struts to assist in opening and closing.
They operate much like a vehicle's hood, typically opening from the tailgate end of the bed (back to front).
Some have multiple compartments that open front to back, back to front, side to side, or even rise vertically.
Fiberglass, hard plastic, or aluminium tonneau covers are sometimes installed as a factory option on new vehicles.
Many sellers claim that tonneau covers improve gas mileage because they make the truck more streamlined.
However, air currents create a wake inside the pickup bed, which helps the aerodynamics.
A tonneau cover interferes with this wake, and scientific tests have shown little to no improvement in mileage by using a tonneau cover traveling at less than 70 mph (110 km/h).
A similar effect is seen when the tailgate is down and the mileage goes down.
Tonneau case is used to describe a type of watch case, with rounded, bulging sides resembling a barrel (or cask).
Touring car and tourer are both terms for open cars (i.e. cars without a fixed roof).
"Touring car" is a style of open car built in the United States which seats four or more people.
The style was popular from the early 1900s to the 1930s.
The cars used for touring car racing in various series since the 1960s, are unrelated to these early touring cars, despite sharing the same name.
"Tourer" is used in British English for any open car.
The term "all-weather tourer" was used to describe convertibles (vehicles that could be fully enclosed).
A popular version of the tourer was the torpedo, with the hood/bonnet line level at the car's waistline giving the car a straight line from front to back.
Touring car was applied in the U.S. to open cars (cars without a fixed roof, for example convertibles) that seat four or more people and have direct entrance to the tonneau (rear passenger area), although it has also been described as seating five or more people.
Touring cars may have two or four doors, and the drivetrain layouts of early touring cars was either front- or mid-engined.
When the top was folded down, it formed a bulky mass known as the fan behind the back seat: fan covers were made to protect the top and its wooden ribs while in the down position.
Some touring cars were available with side curtains to protect occupants from wind and weather by snapping or zipping them into place; otherwise, the occupants had minimal weather protection.
The touring car body style was popular in the early 20th century, being a larger alternative to the two-seat runabout and the roadster.
By the mid-1910s, the touring car body had evolved into several types, including the four-door touring car which was equipped with a convertible top.
Most of Model T's produced by Ford between 1908 and 1927 were four and then three-door models (with drivers sliding behind the wheel from passenger seat) touring cars, accounting for 6,519,643 cars sold out of the 15,000,000 estimated Model T's built.
This accounted for 44% of all Model T's sold over the model's eighteen-plus year life span, making it the most popular body style.
The popularity of the touring car began to wane in the 1920s when cars with enclosed passenger compartments (i.e. fixed steel roofs) became more affordable, and began to consistently out-sell the open cars.
For a brief time, touring sedans were offered with a solid back and permanent roof, unlike the roof on a touring sedan which could be folded back and stowed.
Neither version offered permanent protection from the elements.
Tourer is used for open cars.
The belt lines of 1930s tourers were often lowered at the front doors to suggest a more sporting character (however, this only allowed for removable glass or Perspex/Plexiglas side screens; wind-up windows, introduced later, required a more horizonal belt line on the doors).
Just as in the U.S, all-weather tourers are cars with high quality tops and glass side windows; they were later called convertibles.
The torpedo was a style of 4-seat or 5-seat tourers built from 1908 until the mid-1930s.
The design consists of a hood/bonnet line raised to be level with the car's waistline, resulting in a straight beltline from front to back.
Torque steer is the unintended influence of engine torque on the steering, especially in front-wheel-drive vehicles.
For example, during heavy acceleration, the steering may pull to one side, which may be disturbing to the driver.
The effect is manifested either as a tugging sensation in the steering wheel, or a veering of the vehicle from the intended path.
Torque steer is directly related to differences in the forces in the contact patches of the left and right drive wheels.
The effect becomes more evident when high torques are applied to the drive wheels because of a high overall reduction ratio between the engine and wheels, high engine torque, or some combination of the two.
Torque steer is distinct from steering kickback.
Incorrect sidewall ply design allowing deformation of the tire sidewall.
The problems associated with unequal-length driveshafts are endemic to the transverse engine layout combined with an end-mounted transmission unit; some manufacturers have mitigated this completely by mounting the engine longitudinally but still driving the front wheels—this indeed was the solution adopted on the earliest front-wheel-drive Citroens.
Early Renault front-driven models such as the R4, R5 Phase I, R12, R18 and certain R21 models also adopted this layout, as does Audi to the present day in its midsize models upward.
The key disadvantage is packaging; in the case of Audi, which mounts the power unit ahead of the front axle line, handling is compromised by front-heavy weight distribution.
This configuration does however facilitate the easy addition of all-wheel drive; Subaru also uses the overhung longitudinal engine for the same reason, but mitigates the problem of an unbalanced center of gravity by using a "flat-four" boxer engine.
Renault, on the other hand, placed the engine behind the front axle line, but this compromises interior packaging since it forces the engine towards the firewall.
Employ the use of a tire with proper sidewall ply design, mitigating the sidewall deformation.
Where unequal length driveshafts are used, their torsional stiffness must be made equal.
This can be accomplished by making the shorter shaft hollow, and the longer shaft solid.
This solution can be observed on the early Autobianchi/Fiat front wheel drive models such as the Fiat 128 and Fiat 127, and was also later adopted on the original Ford Fiesta.
A mass damper is usually employed on the longer shaft to combat whirling caused by resonance.
Have both driveshafts be of equal length by using an intermediate shaft (or "lay shaft") on one side of the transmission.
This is already implemented on most modern cars.
When the driveshafts have different length and excessive torque is applied, the longer half shaft flexes more than the shorter one.
However, this is a short-term transient effect.
To avoid fatigue failure, the amount of driveshaft torsional deflection must necessarily be small.
Effects due to one wheel spinning more slowly than the other are usually negligible.
Equal lengths of the driveshafts, in the case of no asymmetric suspension deflection due to roll or bump, keep the drive shaft angles equal.
The main component of torque steer occurs when the torques in the driveshaft and the hub are summed vectorially, giving a resultant torque vector around the steering pivot axis (kingpin).
These torques can be substantial, and in the case of shafts making equal angles to the hub shafts, will oppose one another at the steering rack, and so will cancel.
These torques are strongly influenced by the position of the driveshaft constant-velocity joint in relation to the steering axis.
However, due to other requirements such as achieving a small or negative scrub radius, an optimum solution is not generally possible with simple suspension configurations such as MacPherson strut.
Equalise the torque better between the driveshafts by using a low friction differential.
The torque difference is zero if the differential is frictionless, and limited slip differentials, intended to increase power transfer, actually make torque steer worse in suspensions that have not been designed to accommodate the LSD.
These design features include the careful positioning of suspension pivot points and driveshaft CV joints (to keep the resultant torque steer to a manageable amount) and low steer/longitudinal force compliance.
Reduce the amount of torque from the front axle by passing part of torque to the rear axle.
This is achieved on all-wheel-drive (AWD) vehicles with full-time AWD.
Power assisted steering (set on most modern cars) make the torque steer effect less noticeable to the driver.
Steer-by-wire also hides the effect of torque steer from the driver.
EPAS can be calibrated to directly suppress the torque effect at the handwheel, and the steer effect on the vehicle.
